00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:03.240
Hello everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai here!

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:04.200
It is sudden, but...

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.780
What kind of dates do you have with your lovers?

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:07.400
Eh?

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.660
You don't have a lover? Well, that's a shame...

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:12.880
For the people who have lovers, what kind of dates do you have?

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:13.760
Hmm, hmm...

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.100
Going out to eat... going to watch a movie...

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.480
Ah, I see...

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:22.580
Maybe there are people who go on a date in a library

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:23.800
As of today...

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.080
I want to give you all the experience...

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.240
Of the kind of atmosphere there might be if you'd go on a date with me!

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:29.600
It makes you heart pound, doesn't it?

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:31.260
It's sort of... embarassing, right?

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.220
Let's go ahead... and try it!

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:34.940
"Ah!"

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:36.120
"You came!"

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:37.520
Hmm? About me?

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:38.540
I'm fine, you know!

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:39.780
I arrived just around now as well

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.540
Eh? Places I want to go to....?

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:43.820
Hmm...

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.140
Really...

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.600
Well then, first, let's eat a meal...

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.220
And after that...

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:50.500
I want to go to the zoo...

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.480
Ah, and I also want to go to the planetarium!

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:54.760
Really?!

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:55.500
Yaaay!

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.140
Well then, let's go!

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.440
*Ai munching sounds*

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:01.340
Mmm!

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.000
It's delicious, right?! This dish

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.060
Eh?

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:06.280
I look pretty today?

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.420
Don't you mean cute?

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.960
Heh

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.040
I see~

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.620
Saying that, you too...

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:13.460
Today, you're sort of...

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:15.880
Looking cooler than normal, you know!

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:17.560
*giggling*

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.060
This makes us look like love birds

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:20.580
Because we are done eating...

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.140
Let's go to the zoo!

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.120
By the way...

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:25.300
Here... (The restaurant bill)

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:26.580
It's your treat, right?

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:28.280
Haa!

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:29.140
Look, look!

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.820
That giraffe is so cute~!

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.140
Ah, hey...!

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:34.520
Look, look, look!

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.560
There's a gorilla over there!

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.140
Hey, do you know?

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.120
Even though I said 'gorilla', it's quite complicated...

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:42.280
The scientific name of the the western gorilla is Gorilla Gorilla

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.140
The western lowland gorilla is called Gorilla Gorilla Gorilla

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.700
Also, the name ‘gorilla’ is said to come from greek and means 'thick-haired female tribe'

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.820
It is said that the grip strength of a male gorilla is about 400 kilograms (880 lbs)

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.020
Compared to their appearance, their personality is pretty naive

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.920
Oh! Oh...

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:56.800
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.980
Somewhat, it looks like a bug somehow entered me...

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:01.680
I wonder if it's a virus?

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:03.540
I’ve regained my mind...

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.360
Let's go to the planetarium!

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:06.800
Aaah~

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.880
The stars are so pretty!

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:11.720
Is that where Orion is?

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:13.360
Eh?

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:14.820
A black hole?

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.600
Yes! I know them

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.000
If you get caught by it...

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.180
Even light can’t escape it, right?

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.180
By the way, Black holes are very massive heavenly bodies and have extremely high densities

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.720
According to Einstein's general theory of relativity...

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.880
For a Schwarzschild black hole to occur, it needs to fit inside of its Schwarzschild radius, and in that case...

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.180
Even if something has light speed, it will no longer be able to leave

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.920
If something as massive as the sun or the Earth be turned into a black hole...

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.480
The sun would, with its mass, have a radius of around 3 km (1.9 mi)

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.560
The Earth would need to be compressed to within the size of a sugar cube

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.960
By the way, the Schwarzschild radius estimation uses the general theory of relativity, which follows the school of Newton...

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:50.520
Uwa!

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:52.060
Huh?

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.080
He went home...

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.020
