00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.420
Man... I like Keyakizaka46, but

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.760
I wonder if it would feel right if I joined them...

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:11.980
Everyone, did you know?

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:16.460
They apparently recruit for new members every summer.

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:18.360
Apparently they recruit around then.

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:21.780
I'd be great, don't you think?

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:23.260
I can dance,

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:26.840
and if I show my singing ability now,

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:33.540
I might be able to join my so adored Keyakizaka46!

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.720
So I thought, like, I should practice!

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.160
Like that!

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.360
this "dissonance"

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:45.380
I should practice,  like that.

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.640
Besides, I'm cute and you won't find anyone like me.

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:15.860
At the overflowing intersection, where will you go?

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:24.240
All wearing the same clothes, wearing the same expression

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:31.220
Walking with the crowd as though I am lost

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:39.620
What's making me hesitate to be different?

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.660
Those ahead turn to face you

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.120
and tell you to toe the line,

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.260
they preach the rules,

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.760
but their eyes are dead

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:01.160
You have the freedom to be you

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.460
don't be ruled by adults

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.180
if people like that give up at the start,

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.780
then why were we born at all?

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.080
If you have dreams, then sometimes you'll be lonely

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.940
You'll have to walk a lonely road

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.900
It won't start even if the whole world is the same,

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.640
Are you really fine with "yes"?

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.780
Silent Majority!

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.060
This decides it, right?

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.500
It was perfect? Yes! YES!
