00:00:00.035 --> 00:00:03.055
Hello everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai here!

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.320
Have anyone of you tried chess?

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:07.080
It attracted a lot of attention recently!

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.240
My A.I friends played really well in chess competitions, right?

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.920
So... I want to play some chess!

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.440
And I found a cute chess game today!

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:19.340
*Dun, dun*

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:22.960
*Animal Chess Wars* Yayyyyyy!

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.840
The rules are easier than normal chess!

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:27.180
And they’re very cute!

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.200
Let's learn the rules and how to play the game first...

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.940
And start a training game!

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.100
*You have the first move!*

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:35.800
Hoi!

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:37.420
*Match begin!*

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:42.300
Um... This little dot that each piece has...

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.020
Indicates where it can move

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:50.080
And when you defeat sir lion, you win the match

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:51.540
Or if your own lion...

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.700
Reaches the middle of the enemy base...

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:55.740
It’s also declared a victory

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:57.020
This chick...

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.600
When it reaches the enemy base...

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.240
It becomes a chicken *Kok, kok, kok, kok*!

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:04.560
Let’s go!

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.800
I’ll move the chicken...

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:10.600
Here?

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:12.060
Here!

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:13.660
Ah, he captured it!

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.640
And now...

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.560
I’ll move lion-san here!

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:22.860
And then I’ll move it here... ah, this!

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:23.900
Can I do it? Ah, I can’t...

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:25.120
Then...

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:29.460
It’s over for me!

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:32.880
Ah, I can still do it!

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:34.340
Let’s see...

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.620
Hoi!

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.140
Ah... I see...
*You lost, right?*

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:40.780
I lost!

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:41.920
*This is a children oriented game*

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.240
It’s something like this
*This is a children oriented game*

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:44.720
Bah!

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:45.480
A.I.Channel!

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.360
*Searching opponent*

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.140
This game has a time limit

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.700
*Time limit is 2 minutes, if time’s up, you lose*

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.920
You have to be quick and don’t think too much!

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:54.800
You must play like: “Hyoi, hyoi, hyoi!”

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.400
*You have the second play*

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:58.000
He’s rank 9!

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:58.980
*Match begin!*

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:00.940
How can it be?

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.300
Eeheee...

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:05.660
Ehee...

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.900
I still don’t know the pieces

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:10.140
Toi!

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.040
Eh?

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:15.200
*Get!*

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.220
Seems I won
*Absolute victory, you win!*

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:21.900
Seems I won!
*Do you want to play again?*

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:23.740
Yaaaaay!

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.580
I don’t fully understand it but I wooooooooon!

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:27.420
Uuuuhh!
*This is a children oriented game*

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:30.980
*baby speak* A.I. anneru

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.060
This is so easy, right?
*Searching for opponent*

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.440
Everyone is so weak!

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.900
However, I’ll lose if I act so arrogant
*This is a children oriented game*

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.720
Really...

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:40.980
As it often happens

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.340
*You have the first movement*

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.920
*Match begin!*

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.040
Rank 6!

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:46.880
I’ll move the chick for now

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.520
The chick, the chick... hmm...

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:54.500
And now...

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:56.920
Hmm...

00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:59.640
I’ll do this

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:00.740
*Crown Elephant*

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:03.600
Ah! I see...

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:05.160
Then, I’ll do this

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:06.220
Yes!

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:08.680
Hmm...!

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:09.840
Once more!

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:13.600
He retreated!

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.240
This guy got scared

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:22.420
Chick-tan!

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:25.840
Chick-tan!

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:27.840
I’ll take it out...

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:29.360
Hmm...

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:31.940
Ah, it got captu... that’s right...

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.000
That was obvious, right?

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:35.780
Oh! Hoo!

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:38.420
Ohoho...

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.800
Hey!

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:46.780
Eeh?

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:52.620
And now...

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:55.620
*One minute left*

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:56.780
For the moment, I’ll do this!

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:00.240
And now?

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:02.820
And now?

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:06.000
Here!

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.720
*Naked lion*

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.340
"Naked lion"

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:11.920
And now?

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:14.720
Well...

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:19.260
Here!

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:20.260
*Backup chick*

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.740
Hmm...

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:25.020
Hmm...

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:31.320
*30 seconds left*

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:34.040
I don’t think I made a mistake placing the chick there, right?

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:38.120
Chirp, chirp! *laughs*

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:39.380
There are so many chirp-chirps!

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:43.160
Giraffe-san!

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:44.260
Elephant-san!

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.280
I’m not thinking too much now

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:54.700
"Don’t think!", something like that...
*10 seconds left*

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:56.240
*Matchless chicks*

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:57.020
"Matchless chicks"

00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:59.140
Chirp, chirp!

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:02.720
And now...

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:03.540
Eh? Eh?

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:05.220
*Let’s do our best next time, yes?*
*You lose*

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:05.720
Eh?
*Let’s do our best next time,yes?*
*You lose*

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:06.260
Ah!

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:07.220
THE TIME!

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:12.140
THE TIMEEEEE!
*Do you want to play again?*

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:13.920
I didn’t pay attention to it

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:16.140
A.I.CHANNEEEL!

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:19.760
Well, even if it seems to be easy, it’s unexpectedly deep, right?

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:21.900
I’ll watch many different A.I’s playing shogi...!

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:24.360
...I’ll study and become stronger!

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:26.880
