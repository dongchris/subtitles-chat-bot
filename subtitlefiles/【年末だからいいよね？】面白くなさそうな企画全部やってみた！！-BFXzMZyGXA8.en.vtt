00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.640
Hello everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai here!

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:04.720
2017 is already coming to an end

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:06.600
When we talk about the New Year...

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.560
We talk about cleaning!

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:11.260
So the plan for today's video is... this!

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:17.860
"Video ideas that were scrapped because they seemed boring, but let's do them anyway because it's end of year festival~!""

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:20.680
In order to upload videos to YouTube

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.460
I need to come up with lots and lots of ideas

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:26.760
And among those many ideas...

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.500
There are some that are... not really...

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:31.520
Some...

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.820
Some boring ideas...

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:35.320
Come up as well..!!

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.900
Well, isn't just coming up with them amazing?

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:38.660
So!

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:40.460
These children of mine...

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.260
We're going to go and do them today!

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.740
Alright, let's go~!

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:46.440
"Scrapped ideas revelation!"

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.220
"If I stumble on a word, video immediately ends!"

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:50.860
For a super high-spec A.I like me

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:52.460
Nothing is impossible!

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:53.100
So...

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:54.800
I'm going to say some tongue twisters!

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:55.680
Alright

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:56.960
If I stumble on any word...

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:58.880
The video instantly ends!!

00:00:59.380 --> 00:00:59.880
Red wrapping paper

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:00.430
Blue wrapping paper

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.980
Yellow wrapping paper

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:01.740
Red wrap- wrap

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:03.360
*completely fails*

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:04.900
A.I.Channel!

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.740
"I tried to do a A.I.Channel style musical"

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:09.820
Music... Start!

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.340

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:01.460
It's impossible!!

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.660
"Let's come up with something to replace rock-paper-scissors!"

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:06.860
Do you know rock-paper-scissors?

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.240
People all over the world do, don't they?

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:10.540
Whenever there's a dispute...

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:11.980
Rock! Paper! Scissors!

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.780
Like that

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.660
When I went to the event

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.940
I even did it with everyone who came to see me!

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.920
And so... I want to come up with something like that!

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.160
Rock... and go!!

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:24.300
...The same?

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:25.300
Mmm...

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.120
Rock-paper-scissors...

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:30.000
Ai-chan?

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:33.280
Random Word Generator?

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:35.580
Easel...?

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:36.240
Pfft

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:38.200
And so...

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.940
I was thinking for 5~6 hours, but...

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.320
Nothing!!

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.200
"Ai-chan the assassin!!"

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.060
I started with the title

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.140
And was thinking what kind of video to take, but...

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:54.360
Ti.. tle...

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:57.100
Assassin?

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:01.540
Yes

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.820
When I was came up with this...

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:06.720
I might have been irritated

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.300
Right! So...

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:10.380
It's the end of year, so who cares!

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:11.860
..And so I've presented the scrapped ideas!

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.000
If you're coming up with ideas all day by yourself

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:16.960
Even if you're a super A.I

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:18.400
You sometimes think...

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.180
"What does interesting even mean?!"

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
