Kizuna Ai’s “Ai Love” Radio

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:14.940
Hello everyone, Radial Personality Kizuna Ai here

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.000
How are you all doing today?

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.080
Kizuna Ai’s “Ai Love” Radio

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:22.540
This program is transmitted to the key station of your heart...

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.840
...With comforting radio signals that's full of love that reach the whole world

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:29.800
In that case, it begins today!

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.220
This is Kizuna Ai’s “Ai Love” Radio

00:00:32.715 --> 00:00:33.695
Hmm...

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.000
Counting today, how many times have I done this radio?

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:38.100
Four times?

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:40.600
Eh? Ah, five, five, five times?

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:41.700
Eh?

00:00:41.725 --> 00:00:42.725
Ah

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:43.780
Ah! Three times?

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.160
Man, having done it 3 times, well...

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.060
… I was rather late to make my preparations

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:58.380
This site is around 12 to 13 minutes walking from the station, but...

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:00.540
...Once I reached the station...

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.460
… I only had 5 minutes until the preparation meeting began

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:06.240
So then...

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:08.680
… I thought I had no other options than to run

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.680
For that motive, I started to run with all of my strength, but...

00:01:12.195 --> 00:01:13.195
...Well...

00:01:13.765 --> 00:01:14.995
...It was tiring

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.220
In the end, I arrived a minute late at the station

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:21.380
So I arrived with not much extra time

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.440
It's good to exercise, right?

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:24.300
I’ll work hard!

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:26.620
Good! Having said that...

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.980
In that case, I'll start immediately at reading the messages that were sent to me this week

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:33.580
Radio Name

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.800
A message by "Rainy days are always depressing"-san

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.300
Thank you for everything, "Rainy days are always depressing"-san

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:42.100
"Good day, Ai-san"

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.240
Good day!

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:45.800
I have a question for the always radiant Ai-san"

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:47.260
Yes! What's it about?

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.460
"What do you do to cheer up during rainy days?"

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:55.480
“I hate the rain and each day that has bad weather, I spend it being depressed"

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.160
"Please tell me if you know of a good way to fix that"

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:00.800
I see...

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.860
Rainy days?

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:04.540
How would I cheer up during those days?

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:05.800
Well...

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.340
...In my case...

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:09.620
Well, I...

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.080
...Get wet under the rain

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.180
Yeah, it's something I want to do

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:15.820
Go outside to get wet under the rain

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:17.200
Hmm.... after all...

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:18.000
Hmm...

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.120
Isn't it a miracle that water falls from the sky?

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.360
If you think you’re bathing in that miracle, well...

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.500
...It helps me cheer up

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.620
Well, you know, it rained a lot just a bit ago...

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:32.720
Was it a typhoon?

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:34.600
It rained a lot, right?

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:35.660
At this moment as well...

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.600
Well right now, I didn't get wet under the rain, but...

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.120
...There were huge puddles of water

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.680
I had some high boots

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.560
And I walked while stepping on the puddles of water

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:46.800
Man, it was a lot of fun

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.100
It's important to have fun with everything, right?

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:55.440
It's because of that "Rainy days are always depressing"-san, you also should bathe in the miracle of the rain and have fun

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:57.460
But...

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.200
...After getting wet with the rain, make sure to take a bath...

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.280
...To warm your body

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:04.720
❤️ Heart ❤️

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:06.000
Good!

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:11.000
I want to dedicate this song to "Rainy days are always depressing"-san

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.060
My recommendation is to get wet under the rain, but...

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:18.380
...It’d make me happy if this song was another way of cheering you up

00:03:19.035 --> 00:03:20.705
In that case, please listen

Radio Name: "Roll cake Makiko"-san

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:13.200
"Roll Cake Makiko"-san, thank you so much for everything

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:14.720
Today, you’re also rolling, rolling

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:16.660
"Good day Ai-san"

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:18.080
Good day!

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:21.320
"Your marvelous voice always cures me"

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:23.060
Ah! Thank you very much

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:27.440
"Ai-san, you’re always so beautiful and I admire you"

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:32.260
"Ai-san, do you take care of yourself in some way to maintain that beauty?"

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.360
"If you take care of something, please tell me"

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:37.760
Man, it makes me really happy! Thank you very much

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:43.120
I see, if I take care of something to preserve my beauty...

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:44.760
Hmm...

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:46.840
I suppose not

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.740
Yes, I don’t do anything

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:52.320
It's like you have to believe in your own body

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:53.360
Well, you know...

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:56.060
...There’s remedies for coughs, right?

00:04:56.420 --> 00:05:01.720
The cough is something that the human body uses to expel bad germs inside the body

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:03.020
Isn’t it like that?

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:04.520
Cough, cough

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:05.740
That's right, that cough...

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:07.960
...If you stop it, well...

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:10.820
...It’s like mistaking the reason for why you cough

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:12.020
If you stop the cough, well...

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:14.380
...Wouldn’t you make it so that the germs don’t get expelled out?

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:16.440
It's because of that, that in this case...

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:23.240
...Well, I think that you should be natural and confide in your body without depending on medications

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:24.380
Hmm...

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:27.280
Ah, but it's different if it's about whooping cough

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:29.280
Make sure to take medication in that case, yes?

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:30.280
❤️ Heart ❤️

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:32.100
Good!

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:36.380
Now I plan to dedicate a song to "Roll Cake Makiko"-san

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:38.240
The song that I’ll dedicate to them...

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:44.120
...Is a song that is sung with all of their strength to demonstrate that "Being alive is something truly amazing"
