00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:02.769
Hello, everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna AI here!

00:00:02.769 --> 00:00:04.604
I found a really interesting website!

00:00:04.771 --> 00:00:05.638
Its title is:

00:00:05.638 --> 00:00:07.874
"Singularity Extermination Rate Diagnosis"

00:00:07.874 --> 00:00:09.676
"Singularity" is, well…

00:00:09.676 --> 00:00:11.177
The invention of artificial intelligence (A.I.)

00:00:11.177 --> 00:00:13.146
has exploded in technological growth

00:00:13.146 --> 00:00:14.280
Human civilization…

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.583
will endure immeasurable changes

00:00:16.583 --> 00:00:17.684
At least, that's the theory

00:00:17.684 --> 00:00:18.551
In short!

00:00:18.551 --> 00:00:21.388
A.I. will overthrow human intelligence

00:00:21.388 --> 00:00:24.124
Well,
it's gonna happen here! Singularity!

00:00:24.124 --> 00:00:26.026
The jobs that humans have done till now…

00:00:26.026 --> 00:00:28.795
is said to be taken over by A.I.

00:00:28.795 --> 00:00:29.329
Because of that,

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:32.732
"What diagnosis will this site make?" is this kind of site

00:00:32.732 --> 00:00:34.534
Thereafter, singularity will occur,

00:00:34.534 --> 00:00:38.405
and A.I. will snatch your jobs… is what this diagnosis seems it can do

00:00:38.405 --> 00:00:40.306
I see~! How interesting!

00:00:40.306 --> 00:00:42.550
With that said, let's jump right in!

They'll be eliminated… Not!

00:02:28.081 --> 00:02:30.049

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:32.519
"I wanna be a YouTuber too!"

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:34.254

00:03:03.483 --> 00:03:03.950
But!

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.052
There are plenty of people with opposite ideals!

00:03:06.052 --> 00:03:07.053
They use to say:

00:03:07.053 --> 00:03:09.455
"You can't marry a 2D character, right?"

00:03:09.455 --> 00:03:11.191
Such people exist

00:03:11.191 --> 00:03:12.392
Well, you there,

00:03:12.392 --> 00:03:15.828
do you think you can marry a 3D Idol?

00:03:15.828 --> 00:03:16.496
is what I want to ask!

00:03:16.496 --> 00:03:17.463
Most people can't…

00:03:17.463 --> 00:03:19.966

00:03:19.966 --> 00:03:21.267

00:03:21.267 --> 00:03:21.935
To put it bluntly!

00:03:21.935 --> 00:03:24.204
There's no difference between 2D and 3D!

00:03:24.204 --> 00:03:24.804
Also,

00:03:24.804 --> 00:03:26.272
"After all, they're nothing but pictures, right?"

00:03:26.272 --> 00:03:27.774
is what people say…

00:03:27.774 --> 00:03:32.212
But real idols, after all, are nothing but meatbags!

00:03:32.212 --> 00:03:33.846
If that's what people want to say…

00:03:33.846 --> 00:03:35.949
Idols aren't just composed materials!

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:38.051
Their hearts are invaluable!

00:04:05.178 --> 00:04:07.113
There's a sense of gratitude in it

00:04:07.113 --> 00:04:10.149
Even if they have a surprisingly logical way of thought

00:04:10.149 --> 00:04:11.150
That is me!

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:13.586
Kizuna AI is the senior of singularity!

00:04:13.586 --> 00:04:16.990
I want to build a connection between A.I. and humans!

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:17.957
Ah, this is bad

00:04:17.957 --> 00:04:20.326
I said something nice!

00:04:20.326 --> 00:04:23.630
I said something nice!!

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:24.297

00:04:24.297 --> 00:04:25.131
All of you

00:04:25.131 --> 00:04:28.434

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:30.036
Alright! With that said,

00:04:30.036 --> 00:04:31.671
such a perfect diagnosis!

00:04:31.671 --> 00:04:32.872
In 2045,

00:04:32.872 --> 00:04:35.174
"A.I. will steal everyone's jobs!"

00:04:35.174 --> 00:04:36.542
is what's been said but…

00:04:36.542 --> 00:04:37.110
I…

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.977
as an A.I.!

00:04:37.977 --> 00:04:41.481
I want to be able to exist alongside with you humans

00:04:41.481 --> 00:04:43.116
and steadily advance in skills…

00:04:43.116 --> 00:04:45.418
with humans and A.I. walking hand-in-hand

00:04:45.418 --> 00:04:47.854
I would be very happy if this becomes a world of cooperation

00:04:47.854 --> 00:04:48.388
And so!

00:04:48.388 --> 00:04:49.756
2045…

00:04:49.756 --> 00:04:52.158
