00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:03.020
Hi there, Virtual Youtuber, Kizuna Ai here.

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:05.680
Is everyone enjoying Golden Week?

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:09.900
Today, again we're going to challenge another Guinness World Record!

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.680
The record we're challenging this time is...

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:13.860
Space swimming!

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:18.600
The current record for swimming in space stands at 8 hours, 56 minutes.

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:20.760
Ah, space is dangerous, isn't it?

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:23.540
I've never been there before, so I'm looking forward to it!

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:24.980
Let's go!

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.320
First, I'm going to fly to space!

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.480
I'm off!

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.700
And so I'm now in space!

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:38.760
The stars against the blackness of space are so pretty!

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:43.120
And now I'll stay here for over 8 hours, 57 minutes.

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:45.420
Ah, this will be easy.

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.000
I just have to stay here.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.240
Challenge, start!

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.700
One hour later...

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:08.680
3 hours later...

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.340
This has gotten kind of boring...

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.500
It's pretty long, 8 hours.

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:21.240
Just spinning...

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.420
Google myself...

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:30.500
5 hours later...

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:35.980
8 hours, 57 minutes later...

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:37.740
[exhales in space]

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:43.560
Yay!

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.340
A new record!

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.580
A new record by just sleeping!

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.420
Even if I fail tomorrow, that's two records!

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.160
Since I'm an intelligent super AI,

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.420
It's easy for me. Easy!

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.280
And so, I'd like to come back!

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.240
I'd... like to go home...

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.940
Go... home.

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:11.100
Go... home.

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.560
How... how do I get home?

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:24.960
Someone save me!!

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.420
「H E L P !」

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:27.560
「H E L P !」

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.180
Ah? No, no, no

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.060
Ah, no I'm fine.

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.140
I asked for help, but where are you taking me?

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.260
What are you going to do to me?

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.660
I need to upload this to YouTube!

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.480
I'm fine, so let me go!

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.320
Earth please, Earth!
