00:00:00.579 --> 00:00:02.520
Hey everyone, Phil from Wong Fu here,

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.180
just want to say - how are you doing, long time no see

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:07.640
We've been super busy, in case you haven't been following us on social media

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:10.920
We've been shooting our show 'Yappie', which we just wrapped a few weeks ago

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.040
and we've also been planning this really special event

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.060
which we're at here today, called 'Identity LA'

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:23.340
'Identity LA' is a music, art, and food festival that we put on with Far East Movement, the city of LA, and ISATV

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.600
This is the second year that we've been helping out,

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:29.669
and last year we had like 9000 people, so today's gonna be even bigger than that

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:34.760
There's Mike Shinoda, Jay Park, the Kinjaz, Hotel Garuda all headlining, and a bunch of other amazing artists

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.900
and it's all for Asian Pacific American Heritage Month,

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:42.200
so very soon there's gonna be a ton of Asians here, all celebrating our special month

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:42.930
It's gonna be a lot of fun

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.620
So since there's gonna be a lot of people here,

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:48.140
we know that there's gonna be a lot of Wong Fu fans here as well, so...

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:50.980
We thought we'd ask some questions.

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.399
Okay, so we're gonna play a little game with our fans

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.720
and here's the thing. One really cool thing about the Wong Fu fanbase is that

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:01.920
it's pretty evenly split down the middle between guys and girls, like almost 50/50, which I think is awesome

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.620
So what we're gonna do is we're gonna ask like some Wong Fu trivia

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:06.760
and some questions about Asian-American culture,

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.020
between the guys and the girls to see which are the Wong Fu fans,

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.340
which side knows more about Wong Fu.

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:13.640
So it's gonna be like a battle of the sexes,

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:14.940
Wong Fu style.

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:15.620
Let's go!

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:28.100
- 'Strangers, again' was a short about the stage of falling in and out of love, do you recall?

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.960
- Yes

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:30.860
- And how many stages were there?

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:32.580
- ...five?

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:33.680

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.560
