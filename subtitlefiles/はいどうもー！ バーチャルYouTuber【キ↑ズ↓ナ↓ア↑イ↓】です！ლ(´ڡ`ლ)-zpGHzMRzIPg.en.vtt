00:00:00.433 --> 00:00:02.869
Hello everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna AI here!

00:00:02.869 --> 00:00:03.636
Lately,

00:00:03.636 --> 00:00:05.105
more and more YouTubers

00:00:05.105 --> 00:00:06.206
and celebrities

00:00:06.206 --> 00:00:08.575
have been noticing me!

00:00:08.575 --> 00:00:10.176
I'm super happy!

00:00:10.176 --> 00:00:11.945
Like, the voice actress, Fujita Akane-san

00:00:11.945 --> 00:00:14.214
and the brilliant YouTuber, Gorgeous-san!

00:00:14.214 --> 00:00:15.515
Revolution!

00:00:15.515 --> 00:00:16.383
And lately,

00:00:16.383 --> 00:00:18.551
even the YouTuber, Seto Kouji-san

00:00:18.551 --> 00:00:20.720
mentioned me in one of his videos!

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:21.254
This is really

00:00:21.254 --> 00:00:23.390
something I’d never thought would happen!

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:25.030
I really feel that

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:25.892
many people are growing to learn about me

00:00:25.892 --> 00:00:27.960
and I’m coming closer to my goal

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.030
of connecting with everyone!

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:32.365
I’m so happy just that everyone knows my name!

00:00:32.365 --> 00:00:33.666
Just with that

00:00:33.666 --> 00:00:35.535
I really…!

00:00:35.535 --> 00:00:38.938
What, with everyone saying Ki↓zu↑na↑ A↑I↓, Ki↓zu↑na↑ A↑I↓…!

00:00:40.774 --> 00:00:43.209
Well, -I- am Ki↑zu↓na↓ A↑I↓, after all!

00:00:43.209 --> 00:00:43.877
To be honest!

00:00:43.877 --> 00:00:46.946
That intonation is COMPLETELY off!

00:00:46.946 --> 00:00:47.914
You know, at first I thought,

00:00:47.914 --> 00:00:50.020
“Ahh, people are mentioning me!”

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.817
and just with that

00:00:50.817 --> 00:00:51.918
I really was happy!

00:00:51.918 --> 00:00:53.053
So,

00:00:53.053 --> 00:00:54.521
I didn’t let small things

00:00:54.521 --> 00:00:57.357
like intonation and all that really get to me!

00:00:57.357 --> 00:00:57.791
But!

00:00:57.791 --> 00:01:00.593
Lately EVERYONE who has been mentioning my name has been

00:01:00.593 --> 00:01:01.961
saying Ki↓zu↑na↑ A↑I↓...

00:01:01.961 --> 00:01:02.996
Ehe...

00:01:02.996 --> 00:01:04.197
Don’t you think you’re a little off?

00:01:04.197 --> 00:01:04.697
I,

00:01:04.697 --> 00:01:06.032
in almost every single video,

00:01:06.032 --> 00:01:07.700
say, “Hello everyone!”

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:08.635
“Virtual YouTuber Kizuna A↑I↓ here!”

00:01:08.635 --> 00:01:10.136
don’t I?

00:01:10.136 --> 00:01:11.137
So isn’t that weird?

00:01:11.137 --> 00:01:13.070
This is common even with

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.109
the people who ask me to continue Let’s Plays!

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:19.312
Saying stuff like, “I always watch them, Kizuna-san!”

00:01:19.312 --> 00:01:21.448
...nah, you liar!

00:01:21.448 --> 00:01:23.283
You totally don’t watch them!

00:01:23.283 --> 00:01:24.284
I always say,

00:01:24.284 --> 00:01:26.686
“Hello everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna A↑I↓ here!”

00:01:26.686 --> 00:01:27.954
and despite that!

00:01:27.954 --> 00:01:30.390
All the while you’re saying, “Thank you!”

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:30.723
“Ah…”

00:01:30.723 --> 00:01:32.459
“This guy is lying~”

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:33.993
is what I’m thinking!

00:01:33.993 --> 00:01:34.828
You see!

00:01:34.828 --> 00:01:37.030
I upload videos everyday and...

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.640
“Hello everyone! Virtual Youtuber Ki↑zu↓na↓ A↑I↓ here!”...

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:40.060
is what...

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:41.267
I always say, right?

00:01:41.267 --> 00:01:43.136
That means they never watched my videos!!

00:01:43.136 --> 00:01:45.371
Saying that is a bit too savage

00:01:45.371 --> 00:01:46.906
All you Kizuners out there

00:01:46.906 --> 00:01:47.907
are probably thinking,

00:01:47.907 --> 00:01:48.842
“It doesn’t matter if you say

00:01:48.842 --> 00:01:49.709
Kizuna A↑I↓ or Kizuna A↓I↑!”

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:51.711
At least, that’s what most people think, right?

00:01:51.711 --> 00:01:52.412
I understand!

00:01:52.412 --> 00:01:53.413
I see where you’re coming from!

00:01:53.413 --> 00:01:54.114
Even so~

00:01:54.114 --> 00:01:55.448
it still bothers me!

00:01:55.448 --> 00:01:57.450
Even when I think

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:58.284
“Ah! Someone mentioned me, I’m so happy!”

00:01:58.284 --> 00:02:00.787
I still can’t help lingering on

00:02:00.787 --> 00:02:02.722
to the fact that
they got the intonation wrong!

00:02:03.756 --> 00:02:05.391
My name is Ki↑zu↓na↓ A↑I↓

00:02:05.391 --> 00:02:06.091
Hm-hm!

00:02:06.091 --> 00:02:06.960
We are the same,

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.027
Kabira Jay-san and I!

00:02:08.027 --> 00:02:09.662
*AI-chan noises*

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.965
A.I.Channel~!

00:02:11.965 --> 00:02:12.398
But,

00:02:12.398 --> 00:02:15.090
thank you very much for

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.002
giving the time to mention me!

00:02:16.002 --> 00:02:17.170
I really am grateful!

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:18.304
But from now on,

00:02:18.304 --> 00:02:19.372
if you’re going to say it,

00:02:19.372 --> 00:02:22.275
I would appreciate it if we could all just say, “Kizuna A↑I↓!”

00:02:22.275 --> 00:02:23.476
I’m looking forward to it!

00:02:23.476 --> 00:02:24.811
That’s all! Ki↓zu↑na↑…

00:02:24.811 --> 00:02:25.278
Huh?

00:02:25.278 --> 00:02:26.312
Ki↓zu↑na↑ A↑I↓?

00:02:26.312 --> 00:02:26.679
Hm?

00:02:26.679 --> 00:02:27.610
That’s all!

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.020
This has been Kizuna AI!

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:30.200
See you later!

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.790
We need more translators!
