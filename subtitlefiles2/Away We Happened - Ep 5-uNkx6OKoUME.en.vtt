00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:04.220
So

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:07.620
How should I pack?

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:09.200
Dude... it's LA.

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:10.080
So?

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:19.100
It's sunny through the week.

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:20.020
Nice!

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.720
I've been wanting some bronzing!

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:23.420
Right?

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:27.720
Dude, are you ok?

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.640
(on phone) you're doing the right thing.

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.740
alright just don't need to jump to conclusions and get all melodramatic.

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.540
Trust me, I wanted to

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:36.140
and get any sleep last night.

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:37.880
I read the letter like a hundred times.

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:38.840
Creepy!

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:40.420
Wouldn't you?

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:43.060
Yeah, but who knows what the context of the letter was right?

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:45.760
I mean, I confused about how I even ended up with your stuff

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.600
I just hope that...

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:49.600
it's not what it sounds like cause

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.980
cause then I'd hate her! And that's too bad because judging by her profile pic

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:56.500
she's is CUTE!

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:58.060
No

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.000
Cause this would be all too familiar

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:03.900
Yeah

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:05.560
Sorry man

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.680
Let's give her the benefit of the doubt

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:08.480
You're seeing her today?

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:09.900
Yeah

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.580
I'm going up right now actually

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:12.500
(on phone) good luck.

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:13.980
Thanks, see you soon.

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.240
(lounge music)

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.380
No, no, no! I said two, a table for two.

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.120
Yes! Two, the number between one and three!

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:34.460
It doesn't sound like any other number, why can't you understand me?

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:36.620
Look, forget about it.

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.440
Just keep the reservation under Jeremy

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:40.540

see it's just personal did you read it

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:42.400
are you trying to hide this from me

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:50.370
what's going on with you and Jamie

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:55.600
I didn't know it was yours okay so when

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.610
you realize that you still kept reading

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:59.530
what difference does it make you've been

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:01.540
lying to me this whole time no I haven't

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:07.540
all right what's this letter about okay

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:11.050
so about half a year ago Jeremy my

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:14.199
boyfriend at the time moved out here for

00:05:14.199 --> 00:05:17.740
a job after a few months he got more and

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:20.380
more busy and we began to drift apart

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:25.660
one day out of nowhere he called it off

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:28.840
when I knew I was coming out to LA I was

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:29.770
just going through a really emotional

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:32.110
time and I wrote this stupid letter okay

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:33.820
I even laughed about it the next day

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:36.430
don't try to downplay this cuz it

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:38.740
sounded more serious than that you're

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:39.729
just trying to cover up that you've been

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:42.760
chasing both of us I cannot believe that

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:44.530
you would just assume the worst about me

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:46.900
without hearing my side why are you

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:49.750
acting like this okay fine that's here

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:51.729
what's the point you've already decided

00:05:51.729 --> 00:05:54.039
what you want to believe all that should

00:05:54.039 --> 00:05:55.840
matter is that we met and things were

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:58.060
good why can't you just be happy about

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:00.820
that instead you want to bring up my

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:02.680
path because if we never met you still

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:05.080
be going after him you know I felt

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:06.970
stupid about writing this letter but I'm

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:08.410
glad now because it's showing me the

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:10.660
kind of person you really are insecure

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:13.479
and jealous forget it good luck with

00:06:13.479 --> 00:06:16.270
Jeremy if you happy to see Daniel

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:17.800
there's nothing going on between me and

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:20.280
Jeremy

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:24.420
gee you are

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:33.820
you need to figure yourself out

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:35.140
don't feel like dealing with any more

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:37.440
your baggage

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:40.680
