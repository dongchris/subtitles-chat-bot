00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.360
Welcome

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:03.300
Eh, you said it's been awhile?

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:04.940
It's because you don't come here, you see

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:07.340
I thought something happened,
I was worried you know?

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.560
Eh? The store wasn't open?

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:11.700
Nah, there's no way~

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.200
It'd be bad if I closed,

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.300
I need to pay my bills too

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:16.060
I didn't even take New Year's Holiday off.

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:16.820
Crazy, isn't it?

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:18.180
Ah, but because of it

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:19.720
I earned quite a lot lately.

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:20.520
Mufufu~

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:22.160
Right, you noticed?

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.480
Kanto-branch store was already open though,

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:26.880
since I renovated the Kanto-branch,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.120
I feel like renovating the Kansai-branch store of this shop too

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.740
How is it?

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.840
The bottles are now the same, you see!

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.520
These "AI Whiskey" label you see,

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:35.520
Isn't it wicked?

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:36.800
Does it move you?

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.120
Keep buying them, ok?

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:39.020
That's right, another thing..

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.540
I got many mails from you guys you know!

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:42.180
Really!

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.160
Thank you very much,
I really mean it!

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.240
I'm really grateful of your support!

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:47.160
Actually, actually!

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.580
Compared to the Kanto-branch store,

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.520
The Kansai-branch store is more popular,
isn't it wicked?

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.220
As expected, you liked Kansai more huh?

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.420
Well, gathering Kantou people are one thing,

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.220
I'm not disregarding their hometown, but

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:58.900
but you know, Kansai somehow feels more

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:00.260
like 'at home' feelings, you see?

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:01.880
It's somehow relaxing, you know?

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:03.120
Wasn't there Valentine's Day few weeks ago?

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:04.080
You see,

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.240
there's a lot of people asking for relationship advice!

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:07.260
Right..

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.100
Eh? You want to ask for my advice too?

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.040
What a poor soul, 
let's hear what you want to say!

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:16.440
It's been a year since I had this one-sided love,

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.400
This relationship doesn't go anywhere.

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:19.440
Somehow,

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.780
I keep trying to appeal her

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:22.440
she dodges it.

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:24.120
( ï¼›âˆ€ï¼›)

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:27.820
I've been telling myself to just give up on her, but

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:29.280
Somehow it just..

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.880
leeeaves an uneasy feelings.

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:33.920
Is this because my lack of charm?

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.000
Or is it

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.920
that my partner is a dense beta?

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.440
No she's not dense, you dummy.

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:39.760
No way, no way.

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:41.040
Umm~

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.460
Can I be honest? Don't hurt your feelings,  okay?

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:44.320
Honestly,

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.180
There is no chemistry there.

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:47.480
You see,

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.140
you make appeals to her for a year right?

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:51.980
Well, it could be that

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:53.200
from birth they're

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.760
really dense people but,

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:57.300
Most of the time it's

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:58.960
I'm being honest here,

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.940
They're pretending to 'not care',

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:01.520
you get it?

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.240
To make them not feeling awkward,

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:05.980
they're cleverly avoiding your appeals

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:07.400
In a way, it's their kindness. Get it?

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:08.480
So,

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:09.680
when you think,

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:10.760
"I can do this!"

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.440
and try to go for it,

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.440
It would make them feel,

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:16.360
"Waah, this guy is really annoying,

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.520
go realize it for yourself"

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:20.160
They do feel that way you know, girls!

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.300
They just don't let it out.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.840
So,

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:23.760
that's where

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:24.740
how do I put it,

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:28.320
you need to make it clear that you just want to be friends,

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.500
or you could try making appeals to them,
but if they keep avoiding you then

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.600
make a situation where they can't avoid you and

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.500
go straight for it.
Try to confess.

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.940
Make a break for it.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.740
I think that way is much better.

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.740
if you wanted to appeal, try bit by bit

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.360
I don't know how you make appeals to her, but

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.460
when you're making those appeals,

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.320
it's somewhat annoying you know?

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:50.840
Somehow it's like,

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.280
"It's not you"

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.460
they'd feel that way so,

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:58.700
If you ever think to yourself to just give up on them,

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.600
Well,

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.460
for your own closure,

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.080
What if you try to break it to her at least once?

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:05.840
Well if you break it to her,

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:07.260
it's okay if you get rejected!

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.100
Since I'll comfort you here!

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:12.340
Well you see there's a lot of cute girls too in this store,

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:13.240
ok?

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.100
It'll be okay, really!

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.780
But really I think that

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.980
you shouldn't be a 'presumptuous man'.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.420
I also think it would make a good experience,

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.000
for the next time,

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.120
so you don't fail and do something like,

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.600
walking around in circles (?)

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:29.980
is important too

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:31.980
"If you can't reel them in then just reel them out!"

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.040
That famous piece of advice isn't so bad so,

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.080
When you keep making appeals to them,

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.820
"Eh, could it be I like this person?

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:42.900
Mmm, but I'd like to stay friends"

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:43.720
something like that

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:45.060
There are people who think like that

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.300
There are also people who'd just avoid your appeals.

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:49.860
Get to know that moment,

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:52.400
and when you think you had a chance to go forward

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.600
It might be that "eh...?" moment you wanted.

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.000
There's also preferences to people to like and not, so

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:01.220
even if you can't tell

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:02.460
what if you try to be their type?

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:04.360
Make it a hit and break for it,

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:05.680
break for it (laughs)

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:09.220
after you make a hit and break for it, come and drink here

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.940
Ahahahah

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:14.140
In the end it turns out to be marketing, huh

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:15.520
That kind of straight-ness

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.180
"I don't have any feelings to hide from you,
do you like it?"

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:20.580
Relationships are made from experiences you see

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:22.000
Make lots of experiences, okay?

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:23.620
Make the next one counts, okay?

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:25.540
Don't cry now!
(Most of you would be crying now)

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.620
You're a grown up,

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:29.340
so don't cry like that, okay?

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:32.180
Can't help it so, for today,

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:33.940
I'll add in melon in something tasty

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.360
and make it free for you,
and you should go for it!

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:38.600
Since I'll make it a free one for you today,

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:40.260
you know what to do next time you come here, right?

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:42.060
Ah, another thing,

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:44.560
"Since I don't get any Valentines"

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:47.680
"I'm not obliged to do White Day"

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:50.040
Come to me at White Day, and

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.740
properly

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:51.860
give me chocolate

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:53.900
Something like "Pierre Marcolini",
you know?

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:55.020
or something like

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:57.380
marshmallow is kinda tasty you know?

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:58.400
come bring me some, okay?

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:00.580
Since I gave you some advice,

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:02.860
As an advice fee isn't it cheap?

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:03.980
isn't it?

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:05.660
I'm nice right?

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:08.540
That's right, thank you, heheheheh

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:11.580
What are you drinking? Champagne?

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:13.100
We have the peach thing too here

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:14.640
The peach thing is more,

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:15.660
ah you don't like champagne?

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:17.180
But you know, the peach thing

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:18.500
is easy to drink so,

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:20.880
Honestly, I don't drink anymore though,

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:21.940
Wanna order one?

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:23.820
Let's go up the stairs of adulthood, okay?

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:25.960
you want some?

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:27.780
Champagne please!

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:29.200
With that peach thing, okay?

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:31.100
With this, let's work hard!

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:32.500
When are you going to confess?

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:33.840
Day after tomorrow?

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:35.240
Why not make it tomorrow?

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:35.940
You see,

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:38.140
"When the sun sets, so does your will"

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:40.400
Are you going to call her now?

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:41.780
Ah, you would like to talk to her directly?

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:42.640
So tomorrow, then.

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:46.140
So come again tomorrow night and tell me how it went okay?

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:47.500
Ah, the Champagne came.

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:48.600
Thank you, Jessica.

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:50.440
Eh, isn't this bottle opened?

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:51.380
Eh, no.

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:53.340
Jessica, please.

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:55.520
It's good that you bring a bottle to me but,

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:56.540
Champagne is you know

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:58.880
Umm, I'll tell you later

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:01.640
Since our drinks is here, let's drink okay?

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.280
Cheers!

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:06.640
Heey~

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:09.880
Now now, drink it whole!

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:13.440
How was it, good?

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:16.200
It's good? That's great!

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:19.120
I didn't drink any but it was tasty to me too

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:20.180
Yaaay~

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:24.540
If you get drunk I won't take care of you so

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:25.820
go home by yourself, okay?

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:30.060
Wake up, wake up, it's about the time we close.

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:32.020
Hurry up

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:34.520
I'm going to close up soon, I even called for a taxi for you too

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:38.160
Now come on and go home by yourself, okay?

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:41.700
Bye bye. Take care now.

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:43.040
Bye bye!

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:46.360
Watch your steps, there's a drawer there!

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:49.700
Bye bye!

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:51.820
Aha!

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:53.280
Are everyone still here?

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:55.040
You watching this video too,

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:57.720
If you have anything to consult or want me to advice on something,

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.280
I'll be always waiting you know.

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:01.040
It's always open here

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:04.160
I'll be waiting for your visit here

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:06.120
I'll be on your care from now on.

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:08.160
Since I'm virtual, mail it to me, okay?

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:12.040
So since it's about the time we part,

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:13.420
you all take care when going home too, okay?

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:14.780
Bye bye!

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:16.020
Come again, okay?

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:20.980
Jessica-san,

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:22.760
champagne you see

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:24.880
you should only open it in front of the guests you see

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:26.400
I didn't say this earlier but

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:28.780
you drank a bit of that champagne didn't you?

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:30.440
That's just wrong, so don't do it again okay?

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:33.180
That guy was okay but

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:35.100
people who'd know would know so

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:37.860
when they're done with it I'll let you drink so

00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:39.560
don't drink from their bottle-

00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:52.060
[Took almost three hours to do with all these accents and dialects omg]
