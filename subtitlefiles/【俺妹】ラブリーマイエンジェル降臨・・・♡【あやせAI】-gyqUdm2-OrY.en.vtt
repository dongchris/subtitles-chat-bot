00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.880
Hello everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai here!

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:05.520
Does everyone know "Oreimo"?

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:06.180
That's right!

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.480
It's a light novel called "Ore no Imōto ga Konna ni Kawaii Wake ga Nai", right?

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:12.640
The anime was also a lot of fun!

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:16.380
It looks like a project to create an A.I. with everyone's input has been started

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:19.120
Based on the character of Aragaki Ayase from "Oreimo"

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:24.060
Taking into account that I’m also an A.I, I want to make sure to be her friend

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:29.280
Having said that, today, I’ll do a compilation of questions and answers!
"My Ayase (Girlfriend) can’t be that cute"

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:30.640
That's what I plan to do!

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:32.660
In that case, let's start at once!

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.200
This is a service in which you can teach Ayase-tan, who still can’t talk on her own...

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.380
...Placing questions and answers

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.380
Entering questions and answers from everyone...

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.780
...That’s how "Lovely My Angel Ayase-tan" can learn!

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:48.780
That means...

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.660
...That the key is to see at what point I can turn into Ayase-tan, right?

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:54.400
Yes!

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:55.500
In that case...

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.440
Starting from now, I’ll install Ayase-tan!

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:01.860
Ayase-tan! Instaaaaall!

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.620
"Eh? Ayase-tan?"

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:07.160
Oh!

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.200
It turns out that I can also choose a motion! Right?

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.800
I can change the expression on her face just like me! Incredible! Incredible!

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.780
"Yes! I’m Ayase! Let's go together!"

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.920
Ah, I see! So then it's like that?

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.720
Good! In that case, I’ll keep doing more questions and answers!

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.740
"Ayase-tan, you like Kirino, right?"

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.360
"Yes, of course I like her! After all, she’s my best friend"

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:33.700
Eehh? In that case, next up...

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.840
I’ll give her a mischievous question!

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.660
"What would you do if Kirino lied to you?"

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:41.200
Eeh? Considering we’re talking about Ayase-tan, well...

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.780
"That's impossible! After all, Kirino knows that what I hate the most are lies"

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.840
Well...

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.640
"You look cute again today, right?"

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:56.900
No, well, here, I’d want her to respond honestly, something like: "Thank you very much, Ai-chan", but...

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.160
Considering this is Ayase-tan we’re talking about, well...

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.160
"I’ll report you to the authorities!"

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:02.640
That's what I think she’d say

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.920
Well, I want to get abused by her a little, so then...

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.600
"Ayase-tan! What color are your pan**** today?"

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:13.320
Yes, I’m sure that being about Ayase-tan, she’d say this...

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.780
"Shut up! Stop talking, you pervert!"

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.300
I guess something like that?

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:19.600
Even though I’m still talking

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.720
Hey, hey, hey, “Ayase-tan, don’t you think this swimsuit is cute? Try it on!"

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.320
Hmm... this too...

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.200
"Idiot! Aren’t I almost naked?"

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.240
How adorable! What is this?

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.280
Eehh? In that case, lastly...

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.100
"I want to go out with you, Ayase-tan!"

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:38.580
Well, this too...

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.420
"Are you an idiot? I’ll beat you to death! How disgusting!"

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:46.340
Lovely My Angel Ayase-tan!

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:48.700
She’s so cute!

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:54.960
Let’s talk together when you turn into an A.I.

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.160
