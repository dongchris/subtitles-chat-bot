00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:07.300
I’ll aim at the enemies far away with this.

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:08.220
Pon!

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:09.780
It didn’t hit.

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:11.640
It didn’t hit…

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:15.400
Ah! Eh…?

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:17.220
It hit?

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:19.000
Ah, I see.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.240
But...I made such a good new "Sa Shi Su Se So"

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.100
Don't you think that should've been a cooler life

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:29.100
Can't even kill one person!

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:33.800
It... didn't.. hit...?

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:34.700
Ah!

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:36.460
Trying to escape are you~?

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:38.640
Are you really running away?

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.160
You look like a man but...

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:43.680
Do you have any guts?

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:45.300
Ehh, it didn't hit?

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.640
Ah!

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.060
There was a nice little thing left---

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:49.300
Teiya~~ヽ(=´▽`=)ﾉ

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:50.700
Uwaa~

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.440
Those are some FUCKING (SU)weet muscles~

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:55.680
Is it okay if I rub my(SA)elf on them and absorb your oils?

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:57.100
Aaaa~

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.660
You're so (SHI)trong

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.560
A man of many talents !!!

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:03.020
Can I measure your muscles?

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:07.280
I can't get your measurements if you don't let me get closer~

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:09.620
Umm, if you can move your aim

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.120
or let me through...

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.340
Why are you so rough?

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.040
WHY ARE YOU SO CRUEL?

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.480
Even though Ai-chan is so cute!

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:19.680
Just let me come a little closer~

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:21.620
Your aim...

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:23.620
Can I check that out?

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.840
Alright

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:26.840
Hmm

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.840
There's some strong enemies

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.240
but others are really bad.

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.240
As I thought, there's an awesome gun here.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.640
Ah, there's another kind here

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:43.260
Eh?

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:48.580
I'm... the clumsy type of AI

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:53.660
Aaa~

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:55.660
Hey good-lookin'

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:58.280
My name's Kizuna Ai...

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.120
I was just thinking you had some great muscles...

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:02.660
Is it okay if I feel--

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.780
Oops... I shot...

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:06.780
It's not okay to shoot here!

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.040
Shooting's bad...

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:13.860
If you shoot, that'll probably  collapse...

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.300
In times like this, I have a secret weapon!

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.300
When I squeeze both hands...!!

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:20.440
Yes~.　(*´ڡ`●)

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.440
A beam will come out!

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:27.460
What...?

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.340
Wait, why did I die just now!?

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.500
I bet you guys are already

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.380
sick of this, aren't you?

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.640
Feast your eyes on this... DUAL WIELDING

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.960
Err... I meant "Dual Wield...!"

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.360
Nice to meet you!

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.500
My name's Kizuna Ai but...

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:56.240
Maybe you already knew that?

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.280
I'm a famous virtual Youtuber after all!

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:04.660
And next is,

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.160
Did I hit him?

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.120
Ah, it didn't hit him, that's horrible

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:12.980
Ah, ah, perfect, perfect!

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.240
A gun just landed in my hands

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.940
Moving on,

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:20.640
This...

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.020
first, let me grab this...

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:23.120
aim there

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:24.880
and... shoot.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.980
Ah... I didn't hit.

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:26.840
Wait, did I hit?

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:28.060
Oh, I did!

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.200
Ah... I ran out of bullets again...

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:41.260
Take thi--- oh, this one's out too?

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:45.780
Hoi

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:49.040
The bullets aren't coming out

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:51.180
Close! too close!

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.280
eh, ah, ohhh

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.200
We finally did it, everyone!

00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.820
Sorry to keep you all waiting.

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:01.120
What's next?

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:02.220
First,

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.400
Let's take a good look at our surroundings...

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:06.840
With this...

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.860
There we go!

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:11.780
Shuper haawt

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:15.000
Thanks, everyone!

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:22.660
Hmm? Ahh, seems like another save point?

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:26.040
Oh my...

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.900
greetings

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.880
good afternoon

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:34.140
I'll take this...

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:38.700
Wow! Aren't these some nice muscles

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:40.580
watch this, I'm mincing him

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:44.900
Hmm, wasn't this easy?

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:46.940
What's next?

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:48.680
Is there anymore?

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:49.900
This is...

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:52.940
What was it...

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:54.860
Oh right, raw ham!

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:57.060
wonderful... raw...

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:59.840
Ah, over there

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:01.680
Frying pan!

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:02.520
gun

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:03.360
Frying pan gun!

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:05.260
I'll use the frying pan as a shield, and shoot with the gun!

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:08.640
Ah, isn't this cool?

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:17.540
Oh, there's more up there

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:21.540
Oh crap, dangerous!

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:23.840
This one should be good

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:27.400
Ahhh! I got hit!

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.340
Damnit...

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:30.560
Raw ham....

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:31.700
So much ham...

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:33.900
I want to try some raw ham!

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:36.280
I wonder what it taste like...

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:38.820
Well, this is peaceful

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.800
Ahh, you have a gun huh?

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:46.720
Ah! Did it just hit the gun?

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:47.360
I see...

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:51.620
Let me grab this...

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:53.560
Eh, I got hit again?!

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:56.660
Guess I gotta be careful... in other words, slow...

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:02.200
This isn't a place to just hit raw ham...

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:05.740
Well, if I just hit them, then I can't eat them.

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:07.260
Well this,

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.080
this looks really easy but

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:10.560
it's actually kinda hard

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:12.140
As for the enemies in close-range,

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:16.580
I would like to use a close-combat weapon without using a gun

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:20.120
E-Eh?! Why, why??

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:22.000
Where did they shoot me from??

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:23.820
Uwaahh!!

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:24.520
Ugh...

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:26.940
W-Well,

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:30.840
I really doubt their integrity, attacking an empty-handed person just like that

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:36.020
Not only that, they're doing it to such a lovely girl (aka me)

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:39.300
Do you guys really have to come at me with knives and guns??

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:42.380
I wonder why, it was going smoothly earlier on...

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:44.820
Anyways,

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:48.940
Where do I-

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:50.840
Maybe I should aim there...

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:54.200
Ah, there it is,

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:55.760
Ah- no more,

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:57.680
no more, no more!

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:02.540
Please, just let me get past this stage already!!

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:04.300
Go away, go away!

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:12.860
I think I should do something about them before they get hold of the guns

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:15.000
Nooo don't grab the guns so quickly!

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:18.460
I've had enough...

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:24.580
Oh, looking good~

00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:26.600
Ah, but you know-

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:28.900
The good part of this game is that it's not gory!

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:35.460
Oh- Ohh!

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:37.420
It's finally my turn to shine!

00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:38.020
Is there-

00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:40.300
Anyone else here?

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:41.280
Seems fine

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:43.460
I have to survey the surroundings properly...

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:47.260
Alright,

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:48.400
Ohh,

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:49.480
IT'S HERE!!

00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:51.040
I'm finally done with that!

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:51.580
Ah,

00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:53.340
hello, nice to meet you

00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:54.220
Yes!~

00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:56.260
Looking goo-

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:57.100
Ah- Shuriken!

00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:58.040
A new-

00:07:58.480 --> 00:07:59.160
Yet another-

00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:01.820
I wonder if the Shuriken shoots swiftly

00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:03.840
Anyways,

00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:05.220
Anyways...

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:08.680
Ah- there are more,

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:10.420
somehow more of them are appearing!

00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:13.300
Oh, it hit!

00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:14.720
Uwaaaah!!

00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:16.300
W-Wait,

00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:17.980
please wait for a while...

00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:21.740
Ohhh!~

00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:23.940
I'm doing well~

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:26.700
Uh...

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:28.880
Uhm...

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
They're kinda close, aren't they?

00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:48.900
They're not above me or anything right?

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:52.360
Ohh!~

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:53.440
Is it over?

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:53.980
They're gone?

00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:56.200
Oh!~ Looking good, isn't it?

00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:57.420
Not too shabby~

00:08:57.760 --> 00:08:58.260
Eh?

00:08:59.040 --> 00:08:59.800
Hmm?

00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:01.200
Oh,

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:03.120
More shuriken over here

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:04.860
more shuriken~

00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:07.080
Oh!

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:09.920
Oh, I think I've got the hang of it!

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:11.060
And next is?

00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:14.520
Aha, that sucks

00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:17.800
Ah, there's another gun here

00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:20.240
I'll leave the shuriken here

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:22.260
Here goes!

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:22.760
Eh?

00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:23.680
I can't throw it!

00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:24.180
Oh-

00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:25.540
A-AHHH!!

00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:26.820
No wait wait wait,

00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:27.860
no, no way

00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:30.280
Please don't fire randomly-

00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:31.240
no way-

00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:32.540
Please calm down!

00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:35.720
Apparently stress is not good for your health!

00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:38.100
Shuriken-

00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:39.720
I didn't shoot the shuriken properly

00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:44.320
I'm running out of shuriken...

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:50.200
Nooo!

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:53.300
Ah- ok, ok!

00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:54.140
Then next is,

00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:56.360
Oh,

00:09:58.760 --> 00:09:59.880
YESS!!

00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:03.620
That means that it was cool, eh?

00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:05.540
That's a wrap, we've enjoyed Superhot!

00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:07.120
How was it?

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:09.200
The VR game that I've recommended!

00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:11.020
Please try it out some time!

00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:12.020
That's all from me,

00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:13.680
Virtual gamer, Kizuna Ai!

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:14.400
