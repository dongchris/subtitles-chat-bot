00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.760
Hello everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai here!

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:04.200
For today...

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:05.600
If you're wondering what I'll be doing...

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:06.120
I'll be doing this!

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:06.620
♪ Te, ren! ♪

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:09.280
Anime Song Ranking Quiz!

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:12.620
Having said that, this time I'll be doing a quiz of anime songs, but...

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:13.320
First, I'll state the rules!

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.060
I'll list the titles of anime songs in a ranking...

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:18.640
Also, I must answer questions regarding that anime!

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.340
In that case, I'll try hard to answer all the questions correctly!

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:22.280
Oooohh!

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.900
"Sugar Song to Bitter Step"

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:29.720
"Tragedy"

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.040
"Zankoku na tenshi no thesis"
(Cruel Angel's Thesis)

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.680
"Platinum"!

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:32.800
Aaaahhh!

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:33.960
What's "Tragedy"?

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.420
I don't know "Tragedy"! I don't know it!

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:36.600
I know all the others...

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.980
If I had to sort them in a ranking according to my preference...

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:41.260
Since I don't know what song is "Tragedy", I'll put it in 10th place

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.500
And later "Zankoku na Tenshi no Thesis"...

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:44.880
It should have reached the top position, but...

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:46.960
I already got tired of it, so I'll put it in 9th place

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.180
And later, well...

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.000
I'd place "Sugar Song to Bitter Step"...

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.420
And later, I suppose it'd be "Platinum"...

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.720
"Platinum" is a nice song, isn't it?

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.920
Well, for the moment, I've placed them in the order of preference...

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:58.420
♪ Ten! ♪

00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:58.960
Ah!

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.000
The correct answer is 10th place: "Tragedy"!

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.140
9th place: "Sugar Song to Bitter Step"

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.320
8th place:  "Zankoku na Tenshi no Thesis"

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:06.340
7th place: "Platinum"

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:11.140
That means, my artistic sense isn't so wrong, right?

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:12.180
I see, I see...

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.800
With respect to the anime that correspond to each song...

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.195
First off, "Platinum" is from "Card Captor Sakura"

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.780
Sakura-chan!

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.960
The 8th, "Zankoku na Tenshi no Thesis"...

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.060
Is from "Evangelion", right?

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:21.920
"Sugar Song to Bitter Step" is from...

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:22.740
What was it called?

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:23.320
Well...

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:24.640
I think I know it, but...

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:25.340
What was it called?

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:26.480
I don't remember the name...

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:27.000
What was it called?

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.740
Good! Next one, "Tragedy" is from...

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:29.900
...I have no idea!

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:30.660
Ah, it's true!

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:32.640
It was "Kekkai Sensen"!

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.260
And later, "Kindaichi Shounen no Jikenbo R"

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.760
R?

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.000
It looks like a relatively new anime, right?

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.140
Eeeehh?

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:40.080
I didn't know that

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.140
♪ There is nothing that I can't overcome ♪
(Song: Platinum)

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.180
♪ If I only believe ♪

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:47.320
Good, let's continue!

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:52.480
I see...

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:53.420
"Butter-Fly"

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:54.380
"History Maker"

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:55.960
"Only my railgun"

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.140
I see

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.480
There's only one new song here, right?

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.600
"Butter-Fly"'s now famous, isn't it?

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.400
"only my railgun" is also pretty famous now, right?

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:05.020
Mmm...

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:06.720
In my opinion, the ranking should be...

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.460
"only my railgun"...

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:09.400
I'm rather tired of...

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:10.060
I'm very sorry

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:11.340
The song is wonderful, but...!

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.580
I'm rather tired of it, so then...

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:13.540
I'll place it in 6th place...

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.880
Where should I place "History Maker"?

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.920
It's that kind of song, so then...

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:19.880
I'll place it in 4th place...

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.520
And "Butter-Fly" in 5th?

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.300
Ah! I hit it!

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:24.720
Incredible! I did it, right?

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.280
It's to be expected from a Super A.I, right?

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.300
I have an amazing power of analysis, right?

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:29.860
Regarding the anime...

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:30.740
I know all of them!

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:33.640
"only my railgun" is from "Toaru Kagaku no Railgun"

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.440
"Butter-Fly" is from "Digimon"!

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.040
"History Maker" is from "Yuri on Ice"!

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.440
Good, I hit it! Yaaay!

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.380
♪ After an endless dream ♪
(Song: Butter-Fly)

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.200
♪ In this world of nothingness ♪

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:52.820
♪ It seems as if our beloved dreams will lose ♪

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:59.420
Good, the moment finally arrived!

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:00.540
The first three positions!

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:01.900
"Bokutachi wa Hitotsu no Hikari"
(We Are One Light)

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:02.900
"Snow Halation"

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:03.860
"Orion wo nazoru"
(Tracing the Orion)

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:05.060
I see!

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.620
It's like the ranking of anime songs...

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:08.780
Revolves around their composition...

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:10.700
Well, I like "Love Live", but...

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.500
Here, we're analyzing the composition, right?

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:13.660
Mmm...

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.460
I'll do the ranking according to my individual preference...

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.900
I really like "Bokutachi wa Hitotsu no Hikari"...

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.320
So I want this to be in the 1st place

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.920
Even though "Snow Halation" is probably more popular, but...

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.140
"Orion wo nazoru" is also great, right?

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:25.560
The ranking according to my personal opinion will be:

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:26.840
1st: "Bokutachi wa Hitotsu no Hikari"

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:27.960
2nd: "Orion wo nazoru"

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:28.760
And later "Snow Halation"...

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:29.260
Tun!

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:30.420
Aaaaaaah...
(Sea lion noise?)

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:31.800
I messed up!

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.760
1st place: "Snow Halation"!

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.720
2nd place: "Bokutachi wa Hitotsu no Hikari"

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:37.780
3rd place: "Orion wo nazoru"!

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:40.100
Man, I can feel the love you have for "Love Live"...

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.860
It's great, right?

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:43.380
I hope μ's will return soon again...

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:44.500
In this case, I'll sing!

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:45.900
Regarding the titles of the anime...

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:47.760
The first and second ones are from "Love Live"!

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:50.280
The third is from Tiger &amp; Bunny!

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:51.500
Pin, pon! Pin, pon!

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:52.940
It's correct!

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:54.360
Well, in summary...

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:55.840
You could say I hit all the questions, right?

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:57.280
♪ To reach you! ♪

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:04.120

Did you guys hit it?

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:08.920
How did it go for you?

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:10.120
Raise your hand those that answered everything correctly!

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:11.360
Oh! Incredible!

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:13.020
Unfortunately, those who didn't respond correctly...

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:14.880
Well, it doesn't matter, after all, you didn't know, right?

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:15.580
Having said that...

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:17.640
This was the ranking of anime songs quiz!

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:18.580
See you later!

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:21.100
There's more at the end!

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:23.380
Translated by Vortex

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:34.300
I hope that soon, my anime comes out and I can have my own song!

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.200
I wonder if I can reach first place...

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:39.680
Perhaps it'll appear in "Anisama"!
