Hey everyone, just wanted to say a huge thanks to Youtube for this paid partnership and letting us be a part of Youtube Adblitz 2018!

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:13.260
Yeah, Youtube asked us to create a playlist of our favorite comedy and big game related videos, including the one you're about to watch

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:17.860
Make sure you check out all the other videos in the playlist by heading over to the Youtube Adblitz channel.

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:19.560
Hope you enjoy our video!

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:33.300
Hi everybody, I'm Bruce Chang and this is Jim Moore we're coming to you live

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.849
from the biggest game of the season. Today is the day you've all been waiting for!
Jim: That's right Bruce, tension

00:00:38.849 --> 00:00:44.600
is high on both sides as bitter rivals duke it out in a game for the ages, but we're not talking

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.140
about what's on television.
Bruce: Oh, you said it Jim, we're talking about the house party. Now,

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.800
these partygoers can't seem to agree on anything, but there can

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.419
only be one winner today, just like there is only one way to cut a sandwich.

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:01.199
Jim voiceover: And here comes Brenda with the pick

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:08.040
Bruce voiceover: She prepares for the slice...
Jim: looks like she's going down the middle, no! She went with the slant route! 
Bruce: Brenda

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:14.040
likes her sandwiches cut in triangles and Taylor is not happy about it. To be honest, neither am I.

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:19.300
Jim: Why is that, Bruce? 
Bruce: Triangles are flimsy at the corners and have a higher crust, too. No question.

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.860
You have bad taste and are a liar, Bruce

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:32.549
Jim voiceover: Basic trigonometry shows that if you cut in triangles it results in 41% more bread without crust.

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.340
What a nerd!

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:41.790
Okay, we have some more activity on the field, and by the looks of it, Drew just drizzled ketchup

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.790
across the entire plate of French fries

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.700
What a monster.
Jim voiceover: I'd have to begrudgingly agree with you there, Bruce.

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:54.140
Dipping ensures that you get equal ketchup coverage on each fry and keeps your fingers clean.

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:00.540
I guess fans of the drizzle just like taking chances. 
Jim: Let's take a moment to talk with our reporter on the field, Diane.

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:02.610
Thanks, Jim. Behind

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:09.059
me, two partygoers are bickering over an order of chicken wings. Min-Soo requested an order without drumsticks. Min-Soo, a few words?

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:17.469
Wings have higher quality meat. That's a fact. 
Brenda: It's too much work. Now I have to wash -both- of my hands.

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.550
You barbarian.

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:21.220
Seems like Brenda doesn't have an

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:27.490
issue with the sides of the wings, it's more about this area right here. She can't seem to get to the meat in the middle.

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.839
Apparently she hasn't had the proper training. Back to you. 
Simultaneously: Thanks, Diane.

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:34.610
Jim: Thanks. Diane.

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:37.990
What looks as though there's a flagrant foul on the field. 
Bruce: No, no, no, a

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:43.119
fragrant foul. 
Jim: Well what's all the commotion about, Bruce? 
Bruce: There's a turnover in the bathroom.

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.540
Yep. Taylor flipped the toilet paper roll around

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:52.280
so that it dispenses from under. I mean, if he were at his home state then that'd be one thing, but at an away game?

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.960
Jim voiceover: Rookie mistake. Let's see if we can get a better angle on that.

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:59.840
Ooh, so close!

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:05.260
Bruce voiceover: His hand is only an inch from that wall, that is practically unsanitary.
Jim: Yeah, I don't know how

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:10.720
Johnson could go for two after that. What a shame. He's been on a hot streak since the first quarter.

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.489
Well if anyone can hold it it's him - he's the best tight end in the division.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.899
Anyway, back in the kitchen things are heating up as Min-Soo and Mary are cooling down with

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:30.190
some vanilla cones. 
Bruce voiceover: Ooh, Mary is a biter and Min-Soo's doing some aggressive gesturing, but Mary

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:33.100
isn't budging. 
Jim voiceover: Mary is one tough cookie dough, Bruce.

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:37.780
Personally, I never quite get enough ice cream from licking - it always ends up getting pushed away.

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:43.560
Well you obviously lack the proper tongue cuppage technique. 
Jim: Please don't talk about my tongue on-air, Bruce.

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:49.260
Bruce voiceover: Speaking of cups, Johnson is putting away dishes and he placed a cup facing -down-.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.620
Drew is beet red, Jim. 
Jim voiceover: Yeah, lucky for us Drew's miked up, let's listen in.

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:55.820
Drew: T-that's disgusting.

00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:01.120
T-the rim is touching the surface, it's like putting your lips on the cabinet. 
Johnson: Oh, you'd rather it face up?

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:05.860
To collect dust. 
Drew: Dust? How often are you using cups?

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:10.960
Johnson: Face down, Dusty.
Drew: Face up, cabinet licker.

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:16.500
Bruce: Well today was far from disappointing to say the least - it was a mash-up for the ages.

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.400
Jim voiceover: Two sides with long histories, strong convictions, and an unwillingness to be

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:28.100
persuaded. These rivalries will rage on until the end of time. 
Bruce: You're right, there, Jim. There seems to be nothing these two can agree on.

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:30.180
*doorbell ring*

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:34.220
So sorry I'm late. Let's... I brought pizza!

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:38.900
*multiple gasps*

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:43.180
Get out.

00:04:44.249 --> 00:04:48.678
I know we made the video but I actually like pineapple on pizza.
Taylor: Phil you're

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:52.940
gonna upset so many people.
Phil: And I bet we just lost like, so many subscribers just, no don't go!

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.140
No, stay! There's no way we're gonna settle all these rivalries right now.

00:04:56.149 --> 00:04:59.149
We just hope that you guys have a much more peaceful game day.

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:02.900
