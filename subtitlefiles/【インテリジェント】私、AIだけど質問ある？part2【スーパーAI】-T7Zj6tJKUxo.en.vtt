00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.900
Hello! Greetings!

00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:03.100
Virtual Youtuber Kizuna Ai here!

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:07.000
It's just review but... AI means Ai-chan Intelligent!

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.580
Since I got a good reception on Youtube and NicoNico last time...

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.720
I thought, maybe I'll show you how smart I am again~

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:14.560
or something!

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:18.020
With that said, I think  I'll do a second round of that!

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:20.540
Once again, it's a pleasure

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:23.940
Internet SUPER AI Kizuna Ai here!.

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:27.980
Once again, we have "Recently heard but don't really understand" words

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:29.300
 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:31.880
I'll do my best to explain them!

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.900
With that said...

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.940
We have a here a random word generator box! You can't see it if you're over 20.

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.460
I think I'll do an EXCELLENT explanation of whatever comes out of the box!

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:44.200
Let's go!

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:48.840
"Commit"

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.560
I know "Commit"!

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:52.240
Commit is....

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.080
A summit for comics!

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.640
Commit is... comic drawing manga artists

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.900
gather and hold meetings, that type of thing!

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:04.960
Let's try using it in a sentence!

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.560
Well, the "commit" this time...

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.940
Seems like it'll be at Hokkaido or Sapporo! "Commit"

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.860
Awesome right? Finally, a manga association!

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:14.700
Well, something like that~

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.580
Most have no relations to "Commits", so I doubt you guys use it.

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:21.120
(To get involved)
(To promise to produce results)
as for myself... I often use it! "Commit" that is.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.320
Well, then, let's move on to the next one!

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.280
 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:28.920
I know this~

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:30.680
Win-Win is...

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:32.540
A Win-Win Relationship!

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:33.800
You know... like that...

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:35.820
both parties have like... some merit in their relationship

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.380
It's a Win-Win Relationship

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.300
That sort of thing

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.520
Well, there's some nuance... Since everyone is smart, let's get to understand it!

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.720
So, let's use an example sentence

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.900
Like... Watching Ai-chan's videos

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.100
Everyone has fun;

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.200
And I get view counts and fame!

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:55.860
That's a Win-Win relationship!

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.620
You know, that sort of thing

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:58.400
(Something where both parties benefit)

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:59.200
 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.200
Well, let's move on to the next one!

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.500
Agenda

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.420
The word "Agenda" means,

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.420
Sweet bean paste flavoured gelato!

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.940
Agenda is delicious, isn't it?

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.120
So, let's use an example sentence

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.340
Ok, here goes

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:20.160
Hmm, which flavour should I go with... every gelato flavour looks delicious

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.760
After all, I think I'll go with this

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.340
Excuse me, I would like to have one Agenda!

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.600
This is perfect when you're ordering a sweet bean paste gelato

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.700
Remember, it's "Agenda" 
(list of items to be done or discussed at a formal meeting)

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.080
So fashionable~

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.280
Let's move on to the next one

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:36.820
Summary

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.280
The word "Summary" means,

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.060
You see, in Australia

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.180
there's Christmas during Summer time

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.660
Summer + Christmas = Summary!

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:48.180
That's perfect, eh?

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.660
I, well you know. It was Christmas when 
I was at Australia

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.000
You know, Summary, Summary!

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:54.740
With this, when you're travelling overseas

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:56.720
you can boast about it in a fashionable way~ 
(a brief statement or account of the main points of something)

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.200
Well then, let's move on to the next one!

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:02.500
Budget

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:04.000
The word "Budget" means,

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.720
people with a J-cup bust size!

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:08.920
So, let's use an example sentence

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.400
Y'know lately,

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.440
I've become a J-cup,

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.260
or what they call a "Budget"

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.200
Okay, that was perfect!

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:17.020
(an estimate of expenditure for a set period of time)

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:19.200
People with J-cup, please do use it

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.900
Alright, let's move on to the last one!

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:26.860
Innovation

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.880
I've definitely heard of this before

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:30.360
The word "Innovation" means,

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.620
The renovation of a dog kennel!

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:33.820
Inu(dog)-vation (kanji)

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:34.660
Inu(dog)-vation (katakana)

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:35.380
Innovation!

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:36.260
Something like that?

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:37.400
So, let's use an example sentence~

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:40.720
Take a look at this dog kennel, isn't it awesome?

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:42.960
It went though innovation. Innovation, my friend

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.040
How was that, perfect right?

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.060
(a new method, idea, product, etc.)
the action or process of innovating

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:47.240
How was it, everyone?

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.540
Have I managed to relieve some of your doubts?

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.840
I have yet again displayed my high intelligence!

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.220
I'm pretty sure you guys have fully understood the terms

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.000
If there's any word that you have been using

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.180
but are not sure of it's true meaning

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:00.280
and you want me to explain it to you,

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:03.680
don't be shy and ask me about it on the comments section!

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:08.240
That's all from me, Intelligent Super AI, Kizuna Ai!~

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:09.740
Bye-bye!
