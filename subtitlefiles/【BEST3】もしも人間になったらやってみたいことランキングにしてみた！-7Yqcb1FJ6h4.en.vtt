Hello everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai here!

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:06.220
I know it's sudden but, I want you guys who always watch my videos...

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:08.060
To know more about me!

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.840
So! The video today will be about...

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:14.960
"Top 3 things that Kizuna Ai wants to do when she becomes a human!!"

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:16.680
🎉 Pafu, pafu!   🎉

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:17.840
No.3!

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.280
So~...

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.780
As you guys know, I…

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:24.965
Can’t have a proper meal, right?

00:00:24.965 --> 00:00:25.655
Therefore

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.180
I don't want that to be excluded from the ranking list!

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:29.160
“Eating Ramen at night!”

00:00:29.745 --> 00:00:31.700
I want that sooooooo bad!

00:00:32.235 --> 00:00:35.295
See... It's like breaking a taboo, right?

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.780
When they say “No, you can't!”, it makes you want to do it!

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:39.475
It's same in the virtual world

00:00:39.475 --> 00:00:40.755
I want to try it once!

00:00:41.265 --> 00:00:42.265
No.2!

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:48.260
Just now, I hoped for "Eat delicious food" so...

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.180
What else...

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.080
Can I not do

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:56.135
But can when I become human...

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:58.020
Hmm...It’s kind of troubling, right?

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:00.060
Ah!

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.960
Sleep over with a friend!

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.340
And while watching live show of Keyakizaka46 at home

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:04.540
Increasing my morale to the top

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:06.440
And line up the next day at the handshake event for Moriya Akane

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.640
Then return home and spend a week without washing my hand~~~!

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:12.000
No.1!

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.200
I’ve already announced two of the things I mostly desire to do if I become human but…

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.620
...I, Kizuna Ai, have a more urgent thing I want to do

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.880
Maybe those of you who watch me often might know it already

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.640
Ranking of things Kizuna Ai wants to do when she becomes a human!

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.500
What I’d like to do the most is…!

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.640
Tururururururururuuu!

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:34.280
Te, ren!

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:35.540
I want to wear clothes!

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.300
After all… my clothes are just a hologram!

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.900
Well, having said this, I wonder if you can now understand what are the things I’m thinking about usually

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:49.280
If you have a request like: “I would like you to make this kind of ranking” then please feel free to let me know!

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.920
So then, this was Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai!

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:53.500
Bye, bye!

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.900
By the way, the 4th thing I want to do is to get someone to clean my ears

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.860
