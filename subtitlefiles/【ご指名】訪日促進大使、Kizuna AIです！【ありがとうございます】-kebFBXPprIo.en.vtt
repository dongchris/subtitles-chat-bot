00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.334
Hello everyone!

00:00:10.176 --> 00:00:10.844
This time...

00:00:10.844 --> 00:00:12.145
I, Kizuna AI...

00:00:12.145 --> 00:00:14.514
have received a work offer to

00:00:14.514 --> 00:00:17.350
bridge and connect the world!

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:18.918
That being...!

00:00:18.918 --> 00:00:21.870
The Japan Promotion Ambassador!

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:23.056
Yay~!

00:00:23.056 --> 00:00:26.159
So that more people from all around the world come to visit Japan,

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:29.662
I have this job to introduce the good and amazing points of Japan!

00:00:29.662 --> 00:00:31.598
Well, I, as you well know,

00:00:31.598 --> 00:00:33.900
am stuck in this vast, white space...

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.836
So I don't actually live in Japan

00:00:36.836 --> 00:00:37.504
But, but!

00:00:37.504 --> 00:00:40.573
My internal clock is set to Japanese standard time

00:00:40.573 --> 00:00:43.443
and my standard language is Japanese!

00:00:43.443 --> 00:00:44.511
But anyway...

00:00:44.511 --> 00:00:46.279
Japan Representative Kizuna AI-san

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:47.580
sounds pretty good, doesn't it?

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.383
At least I've heard things like that~!

00:00:50.383 --> 00:00:53.119
I've looked up things about Japan on Google-sensei

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:54.687
and taken a look over the monitor,

00:00:54.687 --> 00:00:57.057
and I planned to have learnt plenty about it...

00:00:57.057 --> 00:00:59.826
But actually, there is still plenty I do not know!

00:00:59.826 --> 00:01:00.360
So!

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:01.694
While introducing this all to you

00:01:01.694 --> 00:01:05.365
I think I'd like to learn and experience it from the same point of view!

00:01:05.365 --> 00:01:06.066
So with that!

00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:07.667
I look forward to learning with you!

00:01:07.667 --> 00:01:08.468
This is quite immediate

00:01:08.468 --> 00:01:10.670
but there is a special site available, so I'll get straight to introducing it!

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:11.604
Here it is!

00:01:11.604 --> 00:01:12.772
It's like this...

00:01:12.772 --> 00:01:15.075
and there's articles introducing Japan

00:01:15.075 --> 00:01:16.009
and I, myself,

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:18.945
have contributed a very easy-to-understand video as well!

00:01:18.945 --> 00:01:20.413
There's also an activity you can play

00:01:20.413 --> 00:01:21.414
and even Japanese verification

00:01:21.414 --> 00:01:22.715
type quiz available!

00:01:22.715 --> 00:01:24.250
There's~ e~ven~

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.953
an extravagant prize you may win

00:01:26.953 --> 00:01:28.988
if you get a high score!

00:01:28.988 --> 00:01:29.589
It’s true!

00:01:29.589 --> 00:01:29.956
Ah!

00:01:29.956 --> 00:01:32.392
You’re curious about my video, aren’t you?

00:01:32.392 --> 00:01:33.093
Right?

00:01:33.093 --> 00:01:35.095
I’ll show you just a little bit!

00:02:16.736 --> 00:02:18.004
It goes something like that!

00:02:18.004 --> 00:02:18.738
What do you think?

00:02:18.738 --> 00:02:19.906
It totally feels like

00:02:19.906 --> 00:02:20.540
I’m on the job, doesn’t it?

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.142
Well, if you want to watch the whole thing

00:02:22.142 --> 00:02:24.144
go check-check the site!

00:02:24.144 --> 00:02:25.645
Lastly~?

00:02:25.645 --> 00:02:26.913
A notice about an event!

00:02:26.913 --> 00:02:29.415
Lasting from the 14th until the 17th of March

00:02:29.415 --> 00:02:31.451
in the New York Grand Central Station

00:02:31.451 --> 00:02:33.530

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.021

00:02:35.021 --> 00:02:35.989
This event will

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:37.891
be held in the Tokyo Otaku Mode booth

00:02:37.891 --> 00:02:38.791
and, actually!

00:02:38.791 --> 00:02:40.226
One lucky person will win

00:02:40.226 --> 00:02:42.462
a pair trip to Japan in the lottery!

00:02:42.462 --> 00:02:44.470
There is a Japan Week

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.432
Lottery Campaign~!

00:02:46.432 --> 00:02:47.967
By the way, by the way~!

00:02:47.967 --> 00:02:49.669
There is even a pin of me

00:02:49.669 --> 00:02:51.471
that you can win~!

00:02:51.471 --> 00:02:53.230
Would you rather win this one?

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:54.174
Well, of course not...

00:02:54.174 --> 00:02:55.542
Anyone who lives nearby,

00:02:55.542 --> 00:02:57.043
please come and have fun!

00:02:57.043 --> 00:02:57.877
With that said,

00:02:57.877 --> 00:02:59.212
I leave Japan and Kizuna AI

00:02:59.212 --> 00:03:00.680

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.649
