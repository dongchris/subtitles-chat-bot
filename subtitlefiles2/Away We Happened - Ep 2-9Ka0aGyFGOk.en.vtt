00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:14.320
[alarm ringing]

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:21.240
hello?

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.120
daniel? i need you to get me something from my bag

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.420
it's 9AM

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.220
[it's 6AM here! stop being lazy]

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:38.820
[i have an interview today but the address was changed and i wrote it in my notebook]

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:42.140
um, problem.

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.140
did you lose the bag again?

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.920
no, you have a lock on it. what's your combination?

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.360
ha, I can't give you my combination

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.180
alright. I'm going back to bed then

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:57.060
no no, wait. -sighs- dang it

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.740
Well, what if I give you my combination to make it fair? Does that work?

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:06.980
Uh, I guess so. Just promise me you won't go through any of my stuff okay?

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:08.220
Daniel: [Of course]

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.040
*sigh* Okay.. 1525

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.280
[okay. my combination is-]

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:14.080
got it!

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:15.960
...wait how did you-

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.200
[0000? isn't that the default combination?]

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.920
yeeeah, 'cause that's the last thing anyone would think...of.

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.280
um, actually i need something from my bag too

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:29.000
[alright]

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:30.380
(together) whoa!

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.900
it's like...a women's department store exploded in here

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:45.520
[whatever, at least my bag isn't really...really..../organized/]

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:47.920
was that a comeback?

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:48.800
[maybe]

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:51.140
[you're uptight]

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.580
what is it that you need? assuming i can even find it in here

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.620
[it's a small notebook and there's an address on the last page]

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.340
wow, you do a lot of writing

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.580
[just the last page, Daniel. no wandering eyes]

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.560
sorry, i just think it's kind of cool, that's all. are you a writer?

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:14.220
[aspiring. that's what the interview is for, a big magazine. what about you?]

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:15.880
oh, i'm a location scout

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.340
[what's that?]

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.960
well, basically, i help find places for film shoots

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.020
i take pictures of the conditions throughout the day

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.220
[sounds like fun]

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:28.340
yea, it can be. sometimes, it feels like i'm just waiting for the sun and stars to move

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:33.331
[woooow, how poetic, heh. i thought you liked stars though,]

00:02:33.331 --> 00:02:36.740
[you made such a big deal about gemini last time]

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:42.120
oh that? that's just something i got into on the side...sorry, about that again

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.880
anyway i think i found it, is it this long beach address?

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:45.720
[oh yea!]

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.920
[awesome, thank you so much!]

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.760
good luck with the interview. see you soon

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.320
[oh yea....see you soon]

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.040
that....was the cheesiest conversation i've ever heard in my /life/.

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.640
what? no, no

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:19.000
as long as you're staying at my place while visiting LA, we're in roomie mode.

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.480
and roomies tell each other /everything/

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:27.480
i honestly don't even know what to think, i mean....it was just...unexpected

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.600
how come whenever i lose my bag it doesn't end up with a charming, cute guy?

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:35.300
he was /not/ charming and i don't even remember if he /was/ cute

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.740
are you excited to meet him?

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:41.340
i, yes? no? i don't know!

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:42.860
look, Jean.

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:45.140
you're dying.

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:48.180
(mouthing) i'm sorry

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:54.220
no i'm not.

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:58.200
okay fine, maybe not, but what if you were? you have to seize the day-

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:03.960
i thought i was, Lyn, i mean, up until a couple nights ago i was ready to meet up with Jeremy out here.

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:07.640
wait. my cousin Jeremy or your ex-boyfriend Jeremy?

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:13.340
because, i don't think my cousin Jeremy is really your type, yanno he's really (mouthing) ugly

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:17.520
my ex. i even...wrote him a letter

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.720
awww, you wrote a letter!

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.240
do you want me to call the messenger pigeon?

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:29.300
i was feeling really emotional, and i just thought it would be more sentimental to write it by hand.

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.320
you cannot get back together with that guy. lemme read it.

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:33.140
no!

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:34.380
roomie mode!

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:38.800
uh, fine, i just, i left it in my bag

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:40.460
oh, no!

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:40.960
what?

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:42.700
daniel has my bag!

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:44.560
so you'll see him in a couple days!

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.300
ugh...yea...you're right
