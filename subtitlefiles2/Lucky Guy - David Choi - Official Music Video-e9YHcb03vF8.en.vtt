00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:45.720
It's been so long since I've met someone

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.020
That makes me feel this way

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:58.700
Makes me smile and that's hard to do

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:05.500
I don't think it's something you realize you do

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:15.160
You make me feel, like I'm the only guy with you in the world

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:24.080
We can't be together, can't really be friends

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:30.500
We can't be lovers and we can't pretend

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:36.600
Oh that boy in your life, better make you his wife

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.920
And he better believe

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.540
that he's a lucky guy

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:05.040
You wanted a song, well here's one for you

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:10.720
Nobody will know, except for us two

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:17.900
Don't ask me about it, 'cause I won't tell the truth

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:24.500
Just know that there's someone, thinking of you

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:30.720
You make me feel, something I wish wasn't real

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.300
At all~

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:36.400
Ooooh

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:42.280
We can't be together, can't really be friends

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:48.820
We can't be lovers and we can't pretend

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:55.380
Oh that boy in your life, better make you his wife

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:59.100
And he better believe

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.320
Oooooh

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:05.360
That he's a lucky guy

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:19.140
Oooh, so lucky~

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.460
You were never mine to begin with

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:44.380
So we can't be together, can't really be friends

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:50.960
We can't be lovers and we can't pretend

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:57.560
Oh that boy in your life, better make you his wife

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:02.000
And he better believe

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:04.080
Ooooh, oooh, oooh

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:08.780
That he's a lucky guy

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:14.080
So lucky~

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:20.700
That he's a lucky guy

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:23.680
Woah, oh, woah, oh

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.420
Woah, oh, woah, oh

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:30.740
Woah, oh, woah, oh

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:42.500
[The end]
