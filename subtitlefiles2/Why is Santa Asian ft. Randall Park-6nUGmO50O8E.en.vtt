00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.980
Santa?

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:26.320
Oh, hey! Oh!

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:29.000
Hey! You're not Santa!

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.920
Dad!

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:31.880
Hey no, shhhh. Quiet.

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:32.920
I am Santa.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.220
No, you're not. Santa Claus isn't Asian.

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:38.140
He's a jolly, fat, white grandpa.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.440
Little one, I'm going to let you in on a secret, ok?

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.780
Santa is Asian.

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.020
That's impossible!

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.940
Why? Because the mainstream media has been giving you that

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.180
Nicolas guy for the past five centuries?

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.300
You know that's the first case of white-washing ever?

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.960
But see, this right here?

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:57.960
This is the real Santa.

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.260
So... Santa is NOT fat?

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:02.520
Huh, thank you.

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.720
But no, why would Santa be fat?

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.080
You know how much exercise it is lugging around these presents

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.680
and climbing up and down these chimneys?

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:09.960
It's like freaking Cross-fit.

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.160
Plus, we Asians have a naturally good metabolism.

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.740
But... what about all the milk and cookies he eats at each house?

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.380
Ugh, don't get me started. I'm lactose intolerant.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.900
And... he's not old?

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.420
I'm A THOUSAND years old.

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.220
But, you know, Asian genes.

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:29.980
But what about your beard?

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:32.200
Come on, it took me a thousand years to grow this.

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.120
Look, Lily, my dear.

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.660
You know my name?

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.060
That's right. Magic.

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.420
If you think about it, all signs indicate that Santa is Asian.

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.180
Doesn't it make sense that the biggest economic power in the world

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.160
would want an universal event that inflates every nation's GDP?

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.460
Wait, my toys AREN'T made in the North Pole?

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.780
The North Pole?! Do you know how inefficient it would be

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.980
to have an entire workforce up there?

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:01.940
The East Pole already has the infrastructure in place.

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:03.100
Infra-what?!

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.260
And putting kids on a Naughty or Nice list, who would do that?

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.160
A tiger mom. [whispering] Mrs. Claus

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:10.860
Ohhhkay.

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.580
And that's why we only give presents once a year, on a designated day.

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.060
Any more than that and we're awarding kids far too often,

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:18.020
her words, not mine.

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.460
That sounds kind of sad.

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.760
Oh, no no, Lily, no.

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.940
Because you know what? We bring joy to billions

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.140
of people around the world every year.

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.280
You should be really proud of that, Lily.

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.840
You should be proud that Santa is Asian.

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.820
Just like you.

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.780
James, James, James!

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:46.960
You won't believe what I found out last night!

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.880
Me too!

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.340
Santa is...

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:50.560
ASIAN! 
LATINO!

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:52.060
Huh?

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.080
Man, that was a close call.

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.280
Oh, same here.

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.640
I mean, you try explaining a Latino Santa.

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:59.760
Oh, ho, hola!

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.460
I mean, no. You know, it was a rough night.

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.980
Yeah, yeah.

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:02.560
