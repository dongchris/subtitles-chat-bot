00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:08.910
Hey y'all, it's Cathy. So a few years ago, I was a new student in this x-ray program,

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:14.969
And I know that sounds cool, like I was a superhero or something. It was pretty boring.

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:18.090
I struggled to stay awake in lectures every day.

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:23.279
Although, there was one particular day that changed my life.

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:25.949
Forever! [EARRAPE SOUNDS]

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:31.140
Me and my classmate Kate, were walking down the hallway, and we caught a quick glimpse of a guy,

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.060
who kinda looked like Dwayne Johnson, but with hair.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.340
He was cute, tall, and had muscles,

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:41.980
like I could see his arms through his teal scrubs.

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:43.880
noiceeeeeeeeeeeeeee

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.700
We lost sight of him when he entered a patient's room.

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.000
But then we realised, that was the same room that we also needed to go into.

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:57.209
Kate and I both gasped [LOUD GASP], and gave each other this look of nervous excitement.

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.859
We bursted out laughing as we anxiously walked toward the room to see this guy.

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:07.340
I mean, [COUGH] the patient. My heart was pounding.

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.900
We parked our portable x-ray machine outside and peeked in.

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.380
I deduced that he was a respiratory therapist student.

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.700
That explains why I had so much trouble breathing walking over here.

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.900
He took my breath away.

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.280
Maybe he can give me CPR.

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.620
Some mouth-to-mouth, whoa, the possibilities!

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:27.860
But, what was his name?

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.300
I wasn't close enough to see his badge

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:34.040
Then, he turned and started walking towards me.

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.740
In a sad effort to flirt, I asked, "Is it okay if we come in for an X-ray now?"

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.400
God, that was awful! Quick, say something else.

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.960
"Don't want you to get radiated!"

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:46.880
Much better!

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.280
"Oh, you actually care about me?"

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.620
His reply caught me off guard as I let out a quiet giggle.

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.300
[LONG GIGGLE]

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:02.660
The good thing was, I was also able to catch the name on his badge: Michael.

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:05.450
Michael.

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:06.710
Mike.

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.200
Mikeyyyyyy.

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.460
Or just Michael.

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:12.380
Holy moly, I was giddy about this new human being.

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.400
It wasn't until a week later that I saw him around the hospital again.

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.100
We were both headed to the same patient's room, again!

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.840
MICHAEL: "Hi, I'm Michael."

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:25.690
[LAUGH] CATHY'S MIND: "I know."

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.330
CATHY: "Oh, hiiiiiii."

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.720
We small talked for a bit.

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.820
I found out he loves sushi, I love sushi.

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.420
He loves basketball, I can learn.

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.110
We were the same age. We had some mutual friends.

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.839
We totally hit it off, and that's when he leaned in and said,

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.360
MICHAEL: "Can I ask you a question?"

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:46.877
This is it. He's gonna confess his like for me.

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.920
He'll ask me out, we'll fly away,

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.780
and we'll become an X-ray CPR dynamic duo!

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:54.320
CATHY: "Yeah, what's up?"

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:58.580
MICHAEL: "Do you, er, know if that girl with the pretty eyes in your department is er, single?"

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:01.240
I...

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:02.420
died.

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:04.940
Okay, no, I was crushed.

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:06.800
Are you kidding me?

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.263
Why would he ask me such a thing?

00:03:08.263 --> 00:03:10.300
With the forced smile, I answered,

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.120
"Oh, yeah. She's pretty and no, she has a boyfriend. Sorry."

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.860
The thing was I knew exactly who he was talking about.

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:19.560
This other girl, named Cindy.

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.360
Because she does have pretty eyes...

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.160
...pretty fake eyes! They're coloured contacts.

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:27.100
Those aren't even her real eye colour. They're fake!

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:31.540
I vented to Kate and told her how Michael thought Cindy was pretty.

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:37.960
She assured me that he was crazy for not noticing my really normal, but real dark brown eyes.

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.620
CATHY: "Aww... Thanks, Kate,

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:42.760
but how does that get him to notice me?!"

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:45.520
I needed to step up my game.

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:47.960
So literally, the next day,

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:51.200
I came into the hospital my face all done up.

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:54.600
Full makeup, eyelashes, and yes,

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.940
FAKE. COLOURED. CONTACTS.

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.440
I roamed the hospital with my eyes wide open all day.

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:03.160
No way he wouldn't notice me now.

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.100
But of course, he was nowhere in sight that day,

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:09.980
and my efforts of getting him to see my pretty eyes was a waste.

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:14.700
My eyes were also infected for the next few days because of those contacts.

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:18.620
Days became weeks, and he was still nowhere to be found.

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.720
Things went back to the way they were:

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:24.060
Boring lectures and routine x-ray scans.

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:29.660
I found out he graduated, and so I would never see Michael.

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:31.100
Mike...

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:32.200
Mikey...

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:34.790
ever again.

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:37.340
Fast forward to almost a year later,

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:41.030
I was working at a restaurant as a server when a party of ten came in.

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:43.980
I dreaded taking care of large parties.

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:46.160
I walked over to the table and started taking orders

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:48.740
When I reached the last person,

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:55.480
my jaw dropped, and my breath was once again taken away, it was him!

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:58.160
Damn it. I was in my smelly uniform.

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:02.600
My hair was a mess and most importantly, I didn't have my coloured eyes on.

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:05.520
Thankfully, he was still really sweet.

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:08.960
We caught up for a few minutes, and he asked me for my contact information.

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:11.360
No, not those contacts.

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:13.600
[WHISPERS] He never knew about those, remember?

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:16.879
I wrote down my number on a receipt slip, and well,

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:19.940
we've been married for three years!

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.600
Turns out he loves me,

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:25.220
and my really normal dark brown eyes.

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:29.570
To think, we never would have met if it wasn't for that clinic.

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:33.760
I guess patience really is a virtue.

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:38.800
Thanks to DOM for animating me in my Awksome story.

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:43.760
Check out his videos and other Awksome Adventures from Wong Fu over there. Laters!
