00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.260
Hello everyone!

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:02.900
Good day!

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:05.400
My name is... Aiemon
(Doraemon Parody)

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:09.620
Today I'll be using the secret item called "The Anywhere Door"...

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:11.840
Let's travel around together!

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.860
*Aiemon fanfare sounds*

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:16.980
"Anywhere Door!"

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.880
Well then... hoi! Let's go! I wonder where we'll be...

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.820
Eh?

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:25.280
Ehe?!

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:26.800
Where am I?!

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.800
Save me! Save me Aiemon!

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.820
Where am I?! I can't go back home!

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.280
The "Anywhere Door" disappeared...

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:37.920
*Aiemon laughing*

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:39.700
Really...

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.100
Ai-chan, you always, always...

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:47.640
Lose your patience...

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:48.900
*Aiemon laughing*

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:51.740
Having said that...

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:55.800
I thought I'd be going somewhere spectacular, but...

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.120
I was in a kind of jungle in the middle of the mountains...

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.060
And I felt somewhat alone...

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:02.600
So I asked Aiemon...

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:04.100
And I’m back here!

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.300
So that being said, one more time, let's go!

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.340
YAMAHA!

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:11.980
Aiemon!

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:12.480
*inhales*

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:15.180
Can't we go to somewhere more... you know...

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.360
Somewhere more exciting

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.520
No, the instruments are cool, they really are, but...

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.920
But, can it be more... ah, but is this a Yamaha shop from across seas, right?

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.280
Eh? But really, can't we go somewhere...

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.760
Pianos are cool, the guitar as well...

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.180
They are, but!

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.620
Can't we go to somewhere more...

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:34.780
Mysterious? That's what I was thinking

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.620
Save me Aiemon!

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:38.800
Really...

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.840
Ai-chan, you really are helpless

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.780
*Aiemon fanfare sounds*

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:46.700
"Return Door"

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.740
So, using the return door, I’ve returned!

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:51.900
Next time...

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.320
Hopefully Aiemon will...

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.660
Take me to a spectacular place!

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:57.460
That being said, let's go!

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:00.100
Eh, eh, eh?

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:01.940
The North Pole

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.080
No, Aiemon...

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.300
I don't know if it's the North Pole or the South Pole, but...
(It's actually the South Pole)

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:08.080
It's wonderful

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:09.980
There's a lot of country flags, right?

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:11.320
It sort of looks like a ceremony

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.000
Am I a sacrifice?

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.140
It's incredible, but...

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.540
Well, at least...

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.040
I'd like to see an aurora

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:19.300
Ah!

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.080
But, look! Look! Look!

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.380
The stars are coming out

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.680
I can see a vast amounts of stars!

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.740
Eh?

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:27.680
Amazing!

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.280
I can see a lot of stars, Aiemon

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.875
Eh? That's amazing, that's amazing, right?

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:32.440
What is this? A fortune telling ball?

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:33.760
That predicts my future?

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:35.200
Ah! Look! Look! Aiemon

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.440
Ai-chan, you know...

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:38.060
I'm a little...

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.180
I'm tired, so...

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.000
You can return from this place to your virtual space...

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.640
Using your own strength, right?

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:46.100
You know, I'm a little...

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:47.440
Sleepy, so...

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:48.640
I'm going to sleep

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:49.580
Aiemon!

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:50.740
Wake up!

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:52.480
Aiemon!

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:53.860
I can't get home!

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:54.380
*inhales*

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.940
After all, when I use the door, it disappears...

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:58.020
Get me out of here

00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:59.160
*inhales*

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.300
Aiemon!

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.960
*Aiemon sleeping*

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:06.040
Aiemon!

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:08.620
Yes...

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:09.860
*out of breath* For now it's that...

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:11.020
Because Aiemon...

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.720
*inhales*

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:12.680
Has fallen asleep...

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.820
Wouldn't you be scared if you slept in such a cold place?

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:17.600
I've returned to the virtual world on my own power, but...

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:18.380
I'm a little...

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:19.200
Lastly...

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.760
Since it was so cold a bit ago

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.760
I'd like to go to a warm place

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:23.640
That being said...

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.380
Let's go right ahead!

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:27.640
Hmm?!

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:28.860
What is this place?

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:30.200
Maybe it's-

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:31.200
AAAH!

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.020
It's a bath!

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:34.960
Isn't this a bath? ♨

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:35.920
Huh? But...

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.200
There are no girls...

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.480
There are no girls, right?

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:40.840
Aiemon! Aiemon!

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:41.340
Hey

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:42.620
Bring out a girl! A girl!

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.400
Don’t you have a tool to bring out a girl?

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:45.040
Hey, hey, hey

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.440
Bring out a girl, a girl!

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:48.800
It can't be helped anymore

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.700
Ai-chan is always, always...

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:53.100
Well then, here I go

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.880
*Aiemon fanfare sounds*

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:59.020
Wherever you are, Shizuka-chan! (quiet girl)

00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.700
Ehe...

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:00.940
Shizuka-chan...

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:01.840
Shizuka-chan!

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.540
Maybe she's naked?

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:04.120
*perverted laugh*

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:04.700
*inhales*

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:06.180
I think it’s fine if she comes with a towel, but...

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.740
*slurps*

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:08.020
Aah... Shizuka-chan...

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:08.840
Kyaa!

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:10.360
Ai-san, you pervert!

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:10.880
Ai-san, you pervert!
*slap*
