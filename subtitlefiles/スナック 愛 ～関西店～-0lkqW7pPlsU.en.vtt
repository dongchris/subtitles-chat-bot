00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.880
Hmm, well.. Honestly...

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:37.900
I didn't thought I'd be doing this master job but

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.700
whatever will be, will be right?

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.780
Well, you know earning money is important too so..

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:43.520
You probably hear this often but,

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.780
My ex-boyfriend you see

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.480
was deep in debt

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:49.900
I'm trying to pay the debt for him you see?

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.860
So, now here I am walking down this night life job..

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.140
and talking to you like this.

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.760
I'm sorry to make you inconvenient like that!

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.600
I easily get carried away you see,

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.700
now I'll listen to your problem,
come on tell me what's bothering you.

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:04.480
Aah, is that so?

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:05.940
You did what in your company anniversary party?

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:08.140
You slipped?

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.340
Ah, you did it huh.

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:12.080
Why are you still sulking?

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.580
You're a man so get over it!

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.260
It's been a long time too,

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.100
is it your first time failing so bad?

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.300
Did you slipped that bad?

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.260
Let me hear it then. Tell me a bad joke.

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.760
Eheheh

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.160
Nah it's okay you don't have to.

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.640
You see, there are people watching this so

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.220
it'd be easier to show

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:32.260
if I summarize your story so,

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.760
ok?

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:33.860
Using pen name?

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:35.220
Ah, ok ok ok

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:36.860
Pen name: Tsubo-san

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.860
The other day,

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.900
I was told to do stand up at our company anniversary party,

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:42.860
I slipped so hard.

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.460
If I remember that moment in my head,

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:47.640
my heart aches so bad even now

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.960
If I could I wish I could make it not happen at all.

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:51.820
Even though it's been a long time ago

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.920
It's the most memorable pain I had.

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.840
Ai-chan..

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.520
Can you heal my broken heart?

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:00.680
Please!

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:02.480
I see now,

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:03.720
well,

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.960
well, for starters, you're a grown up so set yourself right.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.580
Can't help the fact you slipped you see,

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:09.780
things that are already happened

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:11.920
you can't do anything about it

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:13.880
Don't you have the next party?

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:15.300
For that party,

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:16.960
You use that chance to recover, okay?

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:18.680
You can just make some materials for it from now, right?

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.660
It's not a problem anyway, since you slipped
it made the next person after you to have it easy,

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.180
it's okay, really!

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:25.540
Everyone already accepted it anyway,

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:26.400
can't help it right?

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.340
Umm, so..

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:28.800
for you to recover the next time,

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:30.840
go watch some comedy show in your home

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:32.000
and learn from it.

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.780
Aren't there comedians who does stand up in pairs?

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:36.420
You know, if you do it alone..

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.180
if you slipped on the stage by yourself it kinda hurts (emotionally)

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.080
if there were two of you on stage you'd somehow can make it into a joke right?

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:42.200
It's okay, I'm telling you.

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:43.820
That working hard attitude you see,

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:45.320
it's important to get things done so

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.680
I like those kind of people who works hard like that too;

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:48.820
hard working people.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.600
Eh, what kind of joke that won't slip you ask?

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.680
Can't help it huh, take a look at this okay?

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:57.660
I only going to do this once okay?

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.860
'GETS'

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.100
This is the bomb, you see!

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:03.620
Eh, even though it's kinda old material,

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.620
but it's kinda like, you know, something you can fit into any situation,

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.100
just try it out okay?

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:09.260
Just use it.

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.960
Kay?

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.180
Cheer up, now.

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.500
Work hard and eat good food,

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.060
And drop some money here,

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:15.640
'kay?

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.700
Also you can just practice your jokes here.

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.980
Then you would

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:21.160
be accustomed to slipping you see.

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:22.140
It won't hurt anymore right?

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:23.360
Ah but you see,

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.040
It's almost closing time you see..

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.960
Eh but you just came you said?
You just came in too late you see.

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.000
Come earlier next time okay?

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:32.740
We'll drink something too, okay?

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:34.260
Next time you should also try and do

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.120
a stand up, okay?

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:37.420
Think up a material by then, okay?

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:38.660
You watching this videos too,

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:42.320
if you have any problems, concerns, or want my advice on anything,

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.100
I'll listen to you properly so

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:48.140
But since I'm virtual so just send it with e-mail.

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:53.040
Send it to this e-mail here, okay?
(A tip: if you want to send in English, use simple English)

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.740
Take care now, since it's cold, get warmed up,

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:58.420
and go home, okay?

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:59.960
Bye bye~

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:04.320
Bye bye~

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:08.020
