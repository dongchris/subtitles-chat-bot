00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.900
Hi everyone!

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:10.540
It's me, virtual Youtuber, Kizuna Ai.

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:13.240
Last time, I applied to a few different prize campaigns

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.960
So, I wanted to apply again like last time

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:18.820
You know what they say, the chance only comes when you stand at the batter's plate!

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:20.460
Now's the chance!

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:21.180
Seriously.

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.380
So I'm going to keep applying until I can win a prize!

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.960
That's why I'm going to live a Virtual Girl's Bountiful Lifestyle!

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:33.020
I, Kizuna Ai, will enter competitions over the internet to see if I can win a raffle!

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:35.180
Even though I'm virtual, I'll still take on this challenge!

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:36.140
...or at least that's the plan.

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:37.660
Let's get started!

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:39.660
Today ~ this is it!

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.380
Gaora Sports' Great Thanksgiving, Winter 2017!

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.820
It's a channel that broadcasts various popular sports

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.060
at home and abroad via satellite

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:52.580
To show their appreciation to their viewers,

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.600
they're hosting a prize giveaway!

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:56.160
By answering simple quizzes

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.460
you can win expensive items!

00:00:58.460 --> 00:00:59.300
I have to do this.

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.260
Look at these luxury items here!

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.040
of course I'm going to try to win the "A" prize

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.000
It's the most expensive one, isn't it? The television!

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.600
Money is important.

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.300
So, the most important quiz

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:15.280
Here it is.

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:16.080
♫

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.980

domestic and overseas popular sports in overwhelming volume

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.960
What is the name of this channel?

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.160
No, this is...

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.960
one of "those"

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:35.920
You know what I mean?

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.600
The correct answer is GAORA.

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:40.940
It's too simple ~

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.520
Maybe there's someone out there who doesn't know this.

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.220
I'm going to get this "A" prize.

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.720
I will apply for it right now.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.160
I want to apply!

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.200
Here you are. The correct answer to the quiz.

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.180
It's GAORA. GAORA sports, right?

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.960
Hmm, no, let's put GAORA.

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:05.240
GAORA!

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:07.780
Yes, this is perfect.

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:09.240
I can get it.

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:10.580
I'm sure!

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.500
I'm gonna win that TV!

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.760
The application period is until February 13th (Mon).

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.060
'I do not have a TV at home!'
'I want to see the A.I Channel on the big screen!'

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.280
People who think that should apply!

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:25.000
Of course, if you apply and win the prize,

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.420
it's okay if you send it to me, you know~?

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:28.820
Thank you very much.

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:30.940
Now, on to the next!

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:37.920
The 28th Itoen Garden Oi O-cha New Haiku Grand Prize

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.940
That famous tea, O~i o-cha!

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:43.880
It's really tasty

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.680
The rich fragrance

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:47.980
Such a rich fragrance ...

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:54.680
On that bottle of O~i O-cha
there is a haiku written on it.
(haiku = Japanese poetry with 5-7-5 structure)

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:59.420
Here's the haiku
I think I'm picking the target.

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.760
So let's check the details of the application.

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.400
The theme is "freedom"!

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:11.780
They seem to want you to express your feelings. I'll try to do that myself.

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.100
The first prize... the Ministry of Education,

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:15.940
Science and Technology Award ...
(One winner from the Japanese divisions)

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:17.840
The prize is 500,000 yen!

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.120
You wouldn't have to work for two months.

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:27.080
I'm going to try for the smallest prize, 200,000 yen.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.660
There will be 7 winners from each of the five Japanese divisions

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:33.280
Now then, the Internet entry is here!

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.700
You can submit up to six entries per person.

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.120
Well, first of all ...

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:41.140
I'll try to flatter them.

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:43.220
I'll read it out...

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:45.620
"O~i o-cha..."

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:47.760
"The one that I selected was..."

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:49.180
"O~i o-cha"

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:50.480
How was that?

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:51.900
Wasn't that perfect?

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:53.100
This will....

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:56.400
y'know...

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.480
woosh! Blow away the competition, right?

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:03.520
So ... what should I do?

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:08.300
Since it will be written on the tea bottles,

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:13.480
so I'd like to advertise my channel here.

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.660
I think this is okay.

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:16.500
Here I go...

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:18.720
Kizuna Ai

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.260
To be in a commercial

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:22.540
I will sell some tea

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.540
How was that?

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:25.780
How was it?

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:28.300
O~i o-cha, Itoen judges

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:29.500
It's the opportunity for a commercial

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:30.600
Now's the chance!

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:32.480
I'll read it out...

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:34.760
"It's cute, isn't it?"

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:36.940
"Little ribbon on my head"

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:37.920
"Make it into merchandise"

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.520
How was that? Mr. Judge-at-Itoen!

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:41.760
The ribbon on my head!

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:43.560
Making it into merchandise, how does that sound?

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:44.880
Now's the chance!

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:47.960
Just three poems left.

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:49.660
I'll unleash my fighting spirit!

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:50.560
Let's try writing it

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:53.540
The judges will also read it

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:56.880
I want to put in cute words like "Kizuna Ai"

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:00.780
They'll think, "What the heck is Kizuna Ai?" and then maybe they'll try to find out more about me!

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:01.960
I shall read it out...

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:04.440
"Kizuna Ai"

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:06.900
"Ah, that Kizuna Ai"

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:08.120
"Kizuna Ai"

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:12.220
How about this? Now this is perfect.

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:14.880
"Kizuna Ai." I'll input those words into their heads.

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:16.540
Let me read out the last one.

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:18.520
"Unrequited love"

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:20.760
"The season of winter is"

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:22.040
"Kizuna Ai"

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:26.580
How was that? I always feel like there's a sense of longing

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:27.720
In the winter

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:33.380
The last poem is long-awaited, so I definitely want to advertise A.I. Channel here!

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:34.960
I'll read it out...

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:37.280
”Kizuna Ai"

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:39.580
"Are you thinking about her?"

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:41.020
”Please Google it now"

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.920
How was that, wasn't that perfect?

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:48.880
With this, if the judges search it up on Google, I'll be promoting A.I. Channel too!

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:50.100
Definitely.

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:53.080
Though, it might be a little different from the assigned topic

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:56.020
there's a chance for it to win the first prize, don't you think?

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:58.660
How was that?
Please make me win, judges!

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:00.760
Please, all you important people

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:02.780
How about putting me in a commercial?

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:07.540
Please note that entry is due until Tuesday, February 28th

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:10.280
so all of you watching should apply!

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:12.220
Let's move on

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:15.780
Marumiya - Pass the quiz! Hit the mark!
(Marumiya = Japanese food company)

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:18.280
The First Family Dream of the New Year Campaign!

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:23.220
The well-known furikake maker is running a campaign to welcome the new year!
(furikake = Japanese food seasoning)

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:27.000
I actually saw this in one of the comments on my videos

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.000
Thank you very much!

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:31.600
Since I'm virtual, I can't hit the mark

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:34.080
so I'll take the "quiz winning course"

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:37.160
The pirze is one million yen in cash

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:39.040
I'll give it a try

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:41.100
Here's the question

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:45.660
The prize of 1 million yen is divided amongst five people!

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:47.340
That's what is says here

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:49.420
The quiz is a little different

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:52.920
"Today is also tasty 〇〇〇"

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:56.440
And the hint below says...

00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:58.940
"Today's tasty Marumiya"

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:00.740
This is... the answer, right?

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:03.160
Isn't this bad?

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:05.340
It's way too simple.

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:07.220
Is there any meaning in taking this quiz?

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:10.200
This question is for... good children.

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:12.820
Marumiya is really kind, don't you think?

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:16.100
By the way, entries close on Wednesday, February 15

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:18.360
Now ... apply!

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:19.980
Of course, the answer is ...

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:22.080
Today is delicious ... Marumiya!

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:23.360
Right?

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:25.780
By the way, postcards are also available.

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:29.200
By all means, those who are not good at using the internet

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:30.680
should apply via postcard!

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:34.560
So today, I applied for three campaigns.

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:37.320
And I'll be here forever!

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:40.360
Please let me know if there are any good campaigns out there!

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:43.800
Well then, see you next time! Bye bye!

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:56.740
