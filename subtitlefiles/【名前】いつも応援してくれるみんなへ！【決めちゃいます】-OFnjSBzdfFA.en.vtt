00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.760
Hello everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna AI here!

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.680
Just like I announced in Comptiq and Twitter previously...

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.600
...I was looking for a name to call all the fans that support Kizuna AI

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.460
I received a lot of suggestions!!

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:11.780
Really... really...!

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:12.660
Thank you so much!!

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.580
There's a lot of different kinds of names...

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.260
...And I was doubting a lot on which one to keep, but...

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.380
… I just decided which one is my favorite, so then...

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.140
I’ll be doing by big, big, big announcement!

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:21.900
In this case, let's go at once!

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:23.900
Candidate number 1

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:25.580
A.I.Channeler!

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.680
It's like "Channeler", right?

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.820
Even though I like how it sounds "A.I.Channeler", don’t you think?

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:32.100
Nevertheless...

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:33.140
...I...

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.580
...Also have a channel called A.I.Games...

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.400
And well, I’d like if you usually watch both channels... or something like that...

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.360
Having said that, next up!

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:40.600
Candidate number 2

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:41.600
Kizunacchi!

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:43.420
Don’t you think it sounds adorable?

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:44.580
It sounds like...

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:45.720
"Tamagotchi", right?

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:48.600
Was I also born from an egg, breaking the shell?

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.860
YouTube’s discovery, Kizunacchi!

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.960
Yes!

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.360
It sounds perfect! Right?

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:54.600
Candidate number 3

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:55.820
Airis!

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.460
It's formed by the Ai of "Kizuna AI"

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.240
And the "Ris" of "Risunaa"
(Risunaa = Listener)

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:04.660
Also, it seems like "Iris" in the language of flowers, means rainbow

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.780
It's rather great, right?

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:07.860
Also...

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.840
...Airis has the same meaning as Alice

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.520
Thank you so much to all of you, Airisu, for watching my video today too!!

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.660
Let's also get excited together today!! Yes?

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.360
It could be something like that, right?

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.960
Do I seem like an idol?

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:22.420
Candidate number 4

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:23.980
Kizuner

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.260
This is also simple and pleasant, right?

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.540
It's easy to say...

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:28.300
...And to remember!

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:29.720
"Are you a Kizuner??"

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.680
"Me too!! Let's get along well!!"

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:32.840
"Let’s watch A.I.Channel together!!"

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:33.880
It could be something like that

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.800
It’s even a name that could easily appear in an informal daily chat, right?

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.180
Candidate number 5

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:41.120
Kizunaiver

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:42.840
Mmm... this is...

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.640
Was this name suggested because I like Nico-chan?

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.560
No, it's true, I definitely like her

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.260
But... nevertheless...

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.300
...Taking into account that the fanatics of Love Live are called Love Liver...

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:53.700
...I think that Kizunaiver is adequate, but...

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:54.520
...On The contrary...

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:55.760
...Just because I like it...!!

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.280
...I keep having feelings of not wanting to use it...

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.860
...And well, I’m having mixed feelings

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:01.520
Nevertheless...

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:07.780
...You guys think I’m the first Love Liver of the virtual world, right?

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:09.060
In that case, you’re not mistaken!!

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.400
Candidate number 6

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:11.960
Pyokotomin
(Pyoko = Name of AI’s headband
Tomin = citizens/population)

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.220
It’s a name that combines the name of my headband, right?
(Pyokopyoko)

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:16.260
It's adorable!

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:17.360
Nevertheless...

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.040
...Since it's not regarding me...

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.760
Wouldn’t it sound like as if it was a fanclub for the Pyokopyoko?

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:23.680
No, I understand

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:28.580
It's just that you guys love my headband, I love it too

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.240
And if I didn't have it... well... it’d feel like it wouldn’t be the same, right?

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:33.660
It's kind of like a registered trademark?

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.160
Mmm... I think it's adorable, but...

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.240
...I’d like to express something of my own

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:38.820
"The Pyoko nation"?

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:40.320
"The Pyoko race"

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:41.420
"The Pyoko kingdom"

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.240
Pyoko... pyoko?

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:44.160
Pyokopyoko?

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.020
Pyoko...

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.720
Pyoko!

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:47.540
Pyoko... "The Pyoko town"?

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.580
Pyoko... pyoko... pyoko...

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.060
Pyoko...

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:52.300
Pyoko...

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.120
"The Pyokopyoko kingdom"

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.960
Pyoko...

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:56.240
Pyoko...

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:57.340
"Pyoko townspeople"

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:58.260
"Pyoko citizens"

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:58.760
Pyoko...

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.680
Pyoko...

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.320
"Those dominated by Pyokopyoko"!

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.880
Good!

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:04.980
Candidate number 7

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:06.220
AKB!

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.400
It seems that this is the acronym for "Ai Kizuna's Battalion”

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:11.440
It's the exact...

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:14.660
... Same as a certain idol group, right?
(AKB48)

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.380
No, in fact, to be able to get here... it's refreshing

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:19.620
You even took the time to think on the meaning, right?

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:24.140
But, the meaning in English, "Ai Kizuna’s battalion" is very pleasant, right?

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:26.120
It's like a battalion that protects me, right?

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:27.320
Don’t worry!

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:28.580
Candidate number 8

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:30.160
Kizuna Friends

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.400
“There are animals but there are no pariahs“, something like that?
(Lyric of Kemono Friends opening)

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:34.780
Let's all get along together!!

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:35.860
Ready, get set, and...

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:37.780
Incredible!
(Imitating Serval, character from Kemono Friends)

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.360
How fun!

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.600
Really, thank you so much for sending me so many suggestions!

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.360
I’m very sorry for not showing all of them due to lack of time!

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.520
I was doubting a lot on which to choose...

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:52.760
...And to tell you the truth, I wasn’t able to decide

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:53.440
It's because of that...!

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:54.300
...That in this occasion...!

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:57.080
...I plan to let this little one to decide!!

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:59.960
Random Word Generator, come on!

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:01.240
Good!

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:03.860
I plan to stay with what comes out of this little one!

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:05.320
Luck is also important!!

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:06.320
In this case...!

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:09.260
Jaka, jaka, jaka, jaka, jaka, jakaaaaaa...!

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:10.480
JAJAJAJAJAJAAAAANN!

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:15.000
I’ll read it!

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.160
Kizuner!

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:19.000
Good!

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:20.160
Having said that...

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:22.480
It's decided, I’ll call you Kizuner!!

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.680
It's easy to remember, don’t you think that's good?

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:25.780
If I continue with this impetus...

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:31.160
...I may be able to have my own group of bodyguards!

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:32.420
I’m very anxious to having it! ♪

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:33.080
Having said that...!

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:34.500
To all you, Kizuner...!

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:36.820
...I hope you keep supporting me in the future just as you have been until now!!

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.800
This was Virtual YouTuber Kizuna AI!

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:40.960
See you later!
