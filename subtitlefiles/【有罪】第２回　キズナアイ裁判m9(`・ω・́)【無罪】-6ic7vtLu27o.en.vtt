00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.140
Hello, I'm Virtual YouTuber, Kizuna Ai!

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:03.920
No!

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:05.740
I am Judge, Kizuna Ai!

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.420
Today, I open the Kizuna Ai Trial again!

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.780
I've received a lot of cases.

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:12.040
Thank you!

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:12.900
Let's get started.

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.260
The 2nd Kizuna Ai Trial,

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.220
will start now!!

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:22.640
Here's the first case

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.460
This is from (pen name) Abe-no-uchi san

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.440
19 years old, Male

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:27.760
A junior college student

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.540
"There's a case which I would like Ai-chan to judge,

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:31.320
please help me

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.240
I have a friend whom I've been in touch with since middle school

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:38.580
However, he tries to steal my girlfriend every single time

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:40.440
And before I realised it, they were already going out!

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.920
I think the reason why I was dumped lies with me but

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.320
isn't it a sin for one to steal their friend's lover?

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.560
Please pass your judgement on this issue"

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:50.800
Let's see...

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.400
Even though stealing your friend's lover is an outrageous act,

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.140
he succeeds every time and that means...

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:57.800
Then could it be that...

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.520
All along,

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.640
your friend has been doing it to you on purpose

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:03.820
I would like to now pass my judgement

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:08.920
Not guilty!

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:10.620
Well...

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.060
you see,

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.180
it must be because of your lack of charm!

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:15.040
You see,

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.320
It didn't only happen once or twice, but all the time!

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.240
Definitely when two people who like each other are going out,

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:21.620
it just means that

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:25.700
When you lack the charm to keep the relationship going on a long-term,

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:26.200
yeah,

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.040
it's detrimental

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:28.760
Probably, even if your friend didn't steal your girlfriend,

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.080
you guys would still break up at some point of time

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.940
With that,

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.280
Friend: Not guilty
You: Guilty

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.580
As for your sentence... 
Well, taking into consideration your training period,

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:39.120
that'll be around half a year!

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:40.380
Please work hard!

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.000
Alright, here's the second case

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.640
This is from (pen name) Marumo-san

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.040
20 years old, a part-timer

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.700
"Amongst my circle of friends, there is one who's 
horribly bad at singing

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.680
somehow he himself does not realise that fact

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.040
The thought of that friend confidently showing 
off his horrible singing skills

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.420
makes my heart ache

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.320
Rather than being told by a stranger,

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.060
I thought that it would be best if I, as a friend, 
tells him about it instead

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.760
However I can't bring myself to say it

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.520
I feel like I've done something bad by keeping my friend in the dark about it

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.380
Is that a sin?"

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:14.320
Being tone-deaf

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:17.440
apparently is a hereditary (musical) deficiency

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:18.100
I sounded like an A.I.~

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.260
Ah, I totally did not search this up on Wikipedia,

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:21.640
I know this all along

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.440
Hmm... this is difficult...

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.460
Well... first-

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:28.300
but- uhh,

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:32.600
even though he sings horribly, he doesn't realise it. 
The mental strength of your friend-

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:33.700
is impressive.

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.240
Well, "it's the best if I tell him as a friend!"

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:38.360
would be the best

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:39.740
Firstly, it's great that you're aware of that!

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.180
Well, it differs for each person, right?

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.140
"What is it that I'm that bad at?!"
"What the heck are you talking about?!"

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.520
You guys might end up fighting instead...

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:49.260
Alright,

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.040
I have decided!

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:55.560
Guilty!

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.160
If you ask me why,

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:03.660
"I thought that it would be best if I, as a friend, 
tells him about it instead"

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:04.160
... something like that

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.020
"I feel like I've done something bad by keeping my friend in the dark about it"

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:09.980
Even though you think that way

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:11.760
You're not doing anything about it

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:12.960
I think that's wrong!

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:13.800
What's with this...

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.900
lazy-sounding reason for the judgement...

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.060
No, wait- I definitely think that

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:22.520
it is wrong of you to not take action even though you know what's the right thing to do

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:24.260
If you really think of it this way,

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:25.540
please take action!

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:28.640
Since we're at it, here's a piece of advice from me:

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:29.680
Y'know,

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:33.800
it's great to have a unique singing style but

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:38.840
it might be too unique to the extent that others 
may think that you're tone-deaf

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:39.660
Oh, but y'know they say that-

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:41.940
Tone-deafness can be cured!

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.640
So, you guys can uh, go for voice training together,

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:44.280
yeah voice training

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:45.680
Now, how's that?

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.640
With that, rather than just pointing out the tone-deafness,

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:52.420
tell him that "it can be cured, let's go for voice training together!"

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:53.080
That kindness.

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.280
With that, if it doesn't go well,

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:57.000
then that person's *y'know*,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.220
then just stop being friends

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:00.120
As for your sentence,

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:01.160
Well,

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:02.760
there were some goodwill in your words so,

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:03.720
one week!

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.320
I'm kind, don't you think?

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:06.140
You've become a fan of mine?

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.940
Thanks

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:09.200
Now, let's move on to the next case

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:10.740
This is from (pen name) Taiyaki-san

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:12.520
that's very thoughtful

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:14.280
"Judge Kizuna Ai-dono,

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:18.340
in popular game Poke**n, there's this certain rare item

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:20.480
In order to collect super strong monsters,

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:22.500
that item is necessary

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.040
However this item is really hard to obtain,

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.480
therefore hardcore players are all desperate to get their hands on it

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:30.920
My friend and I are also one of them

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:34.440
However, I never expected that my friend would get the item within a rather short time

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:35.580
On the other hand,

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:37.840
I tried for 6 hours and got nothing

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:41.740
while my friend put together his party and 
bragged about it to me

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:43.540
I am fully aware that the game relies on luck,

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:45.200
and I thought that I was mentally prepared for this

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:47.300
but this is kinda...

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:49.320
Am I guilty?

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:52.020
Or am I not?

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:56.000
Let's see... games... this is kinda difficult, isn't it?

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.720
Oh, but did you manage to get the item in the end?

00:04:58.980 --> 00:04:59.780
Well...

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:05.400
A game that relies on luck... *drags*

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.180
It's really hard to say anything you see,

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:08.360
To brag...

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:12.340
to someone who already has difficulty in obtaining the item...

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:13.840
that's kinda annoying, yeah.

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:17.040
If Taiyaki-san manages to get the item instead,

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:20.880
there's a chance that you might brag to your friend instead, right?

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:21.900
I think that's highly possible

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:22.660
You guys are, y'know,

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:25.160
even if you don't play games you won't die

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:33.360
You're probably playing the game to feed your pride or your desire to "collect 'em all!" so,

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:34.560
maybe or you probably

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:36.660
would have already done that

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:38.120
With that, I've decided!

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:42.520
Not guilty!

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:45.440
Well in the first place, y'know,

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:49.060
the hardcore players might get angry at me for saying this but,

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:50.920
it's just a game

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:52.480
Think of what would have happened instead,

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:53.700
because, for sure,

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:56.620
uh, when you have the upper hand as compared 
to your friend you'll be like

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:59.040
YAAAAAY LOOK AT THAT!!
YOU SUCK!!

00:05:59.040 --> 00:05:59.940
Or something like that

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:01.040
You'd do that right, everyone?

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:02.900
So, try to keep an open mind,

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:04.240
and forgive that friend!

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:08.140
We've judged several different cases today!

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:11.560
From now on, if there are anymore cases that you wish for me to pass judgement on,

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:14.280
please send an enquiry mail to me via my homepage!

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:17.220
I, Judge Kizuna Ai,

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:19.200
will decide whether you're guilty or not!

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:21.280
I will deliver the judgement!

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:25.700
Well then, this wraps up today's round of Kizuna Ai Trial

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:27.440
Court is adjourned!
