Hi! It's Virtual Youtuber Kizuna Ai!

00:00:02.755 --> 00:00:04.945
In A.I. Channel's public project meeting

00:00:04.945 --> 00:00:06.895
We have gathered a lot of questions

00:00:06.895 --> 00:00:09.665
Thank you for all the questions and requests!

00:00:09.665 --> 00:00:12.895
Let's jump into the questions right now but the number received are

00:00:12.895 --> 00:00:15.775
just enormous, so let me maximize  my super intelligent A.I.

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.520
processing speed

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.700
Answer them in speed of light! Let's go!

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.640
*Why did you choose this Hashtag? www*

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:22.920
based on my mood!

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:24.880
*Munchkin cats are the best!
Are cats your favorite animals?
Personally I love cats the most!*

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:26.580
Munchkin cat!

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.040
*Munchkin cats are really cute but I am a corgi dog lover. Munchkin cat vs Corgi dog, which one do you think will win?*

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:30.020
The battle between the short legs...

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:31.780
Corgi will probably win!

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:33.760
Which one is cuter? Techi-techi bird or Ai-chan?
(She created Techi-techi bird in a previous video)

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.120
You're comparing me to Techi-techi bird?
(She created Techi-techi bird in a previous video)

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.480
Of course I'm the cuter one!

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.000
*This video has a lot of cuts/very fast paced*

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.780
That's what a youtuber is

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:43.480
*Why did you become a youtuber?* (text too long)

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.800
The moment I was born in this world, I had the feeling to be a youtuber

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.660
*Please tell me, how are you so cute!! Tell me your own thoughts about that too!*

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:52.040
The most important point to be kawaii is to smile all the time :D

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.040
I recently began watching Ai-chan's videos! Your appearance and voice are cute too, and with your talking ability, it's awesome &lt;3 Here's my question for you! What have you been into recently?

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:55.620
Keyakizaka46!

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.620
*Any inconveniences you can think of because you're an A.I.?*

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.380
When a human can do it but I can't

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:01.940
*Ai chan, how many Gigabytes is your body?*

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.520
158 million %&amp;!()%&amp;!)@

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:07.560
*Male, Female?? XDDDD*

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.260
MAL...........FEMAL............Secret ;P

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.180
Who is voicing you?

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.380
who is the person voicing me? No one

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:15.780
How old are you really?

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.100
My age is..... 5 years old

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:20.400
Make your most unattractive face!

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:22.520
My first comment ever!

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.120
I know this is kind of impolite to ask but

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:26.560
What is it!?

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:27.540
What cup size are you?

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:28.820
How dare you be so rude!

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:30.340
I want to know your interests or recommendations in these categories (best 3): Movies, anime, books, games. Btw, these are my top 3 movies.

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:31.460

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:33.240
Who do you support in Nogizaka46?

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.960
Hori Miona-chan and Ashashu!

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:35.900
I'm someone from Korea who always enjoys watching your videos. What a hashtag … [that munchkin-so-cute #tag]

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:36.960
Basically Ai-chan always wears the same clothes, but are there plans for costume changes?

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.100
Money problems …

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.100
Greetings! You're super Kawaii!!
I'd like you to try wearing anime chick's clothes!

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.420

Please wear a school swimsuit and scowl at me!! (cuz I'm a perv!)

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.280
Buy me a school swimsuit then

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.860
Mimic various Youtubers (lol)

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:53.860
Bun Bun Hello Youtube!
(from a famous youtuber in Japan called Hikakin)

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:55.720
Collab with people on YouTube or something

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.420
Please! Someone collab with me!

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.240
Question! Ai-chan included, various YouTubers made a question corner, but they keep receiving stuff that are not questions. Your thoughts on that?

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.100
I think it's really really sad!@()%%!)...

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.100
What do you think about YouTube's management?

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.600
You mean YouTube's managing staff?

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.520
Well, I really love YouTube!

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.160
*Who edits the video for you Ai chan? I'm very curious!*

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:10.340
I am the one who does it!

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:11.820
What do you do in your free time?

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:13.080
Google my name.

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.660
*How big is the white background area Ai chan you living in?*

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:16.300
This is an infinite area!

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:17.980
*What if you can escape from this virtual reality, what kind of places you want to go to? Please tell me!*

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:18.980
Sea!

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.540
*Do you like anime Ai chan?*

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.040
I like anime! I like so many I can't name them.

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.720
In last questioning section, I acted as a Chyuunibyou right?

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.580
There are also reactions towards that! Let me do it once more

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.460
Dark Flame Master

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.440
*Please sing a song! I really want to hear it!*

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.220
Once a upon a time~

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.160
Inside a forest

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:39.900
I met

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.640
A.I. chan!

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.500
*What kind of score do you get when you go to the Karaoke?*

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:44.580
above 90!

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.440
Please tell us your favourite foreign artists!
If there's none, Japan's artists please!

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.340

Sayuri-san and Yanaginagi-san and...

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:52.480
Project Proposal!

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.280
Let's use DTM [Desktop Music software] to make a song or something?

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:03.940
Otherwise, since nowadays A.I. generated songs exist, how about we try that?

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:05.600
By connecting to A.I.

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:08.520
Then, let's leave the song arrangement to a pro!

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.080
That sounds great! Let's make one! Theme song!

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:12.960
*Please make a gaming channel!*

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:15.040
I'm going to make a game streaming channel!

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.980
*Stream some games!*

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.140
Already doing it! I am going to!

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:20.140
*Please play some horror games!*

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.200

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.880
I also got a lot of gaming request! Thank you everyone!

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:27.460
*All kinds of Japanese dialect requests*

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:28.480
I can't say it!

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.380
*Please introduce yourself in English!*

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:34.100
My name is Kizuna Ai! I'm a Virtual Youtuber!

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.100
Very Very cute!

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:40.000
I read English comment too!

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.880
*Why the ending part has you crying at the end? I'm very curious since the first time I saw it*

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.980
Because I think that's more Kawaii

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.540
I have been trying to draw Ai chan for a while now but I can't draw you properly

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:51.760
Is there any suggestions? A.I. chan you always have a smile on your face too! hehe

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:53.300
Intelligent as expected!

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:54.680
Well...

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:58.780
If you are like a intelligent super A.I like me, you will able to draw it with your sixth sense

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:00.980
Isn't it important to observe the thing you are going to draw?

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:03.840
It's also very important to draw my charming point too!

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:07.340
My charming point is this part! this fluffy thing

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:11.620
on my head! ribbon and around this part maybe?

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:14.160
Also my mesh maybe ^_^ all the characteristics

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:15.000
*Question!*

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.740
*What is A.I. to Ai chan!*

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:17.840
one thing you cannot cut!

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:21.240
*What type of CM you want to be a part with in the future?*

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:23.495
I wanna be in everything but..

00:04:23.495 --> 00:04:25.015
Ofc, It's youtube's CM!

00:04:25.015 --> 00:04:26.820
Ai chan, do you have a boyfriend....?

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:30.000
I don't have one! I'm neither male or female in the first place anyway

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.760
*Hit your pinky in the corner of the desk please!*

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:36.280

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:45.860
*Please introduce me some friends of yours

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:47.500
Alone? What are you talking about?

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:50.340
I have a lot of friends here! Can't you see them?

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.080
Question aside, I wrote a techi-techi bird short story. Where should I put it?

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:53.340
on the homepage!

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.500
Where do babies come from? (A.I. and human both)

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:58.160
This bird brings them here!

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:00.200
*Please tell me your most kawaii line you can think of!*

00:05:10.445 --> 00:05:13.705
I will be in the same room as everyone! then...then...

00:05:13.705 --> 00:05:15.500
be the center of the group!

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:18.780
Standing in the middle! Standing in the middle!

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:22.620
Dancing, Singing and then kiss with all of them :3

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:26.440
