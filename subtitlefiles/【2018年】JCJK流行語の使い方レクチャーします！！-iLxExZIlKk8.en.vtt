00:00:00.435 --> 00:00:03.035
Hello everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna AI here!

00:00:03.035 --> 00:00:06.075
Have you seen this video that I've done long ago?

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:09.180
"The prize to the most popular words of high school students during the year 2016!"

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:10.460
When I investigated in that occasion...

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:15.440
...It turns out that the nominated words for the prize of most popular words used by high school students during the year 2018...!!

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:17.180
...were already chosen!!

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.780
I’ll see which kind of words were chosen...

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:20.840
...And I also... well...

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:24.380
...Taking into account that I have the appearance of a high school student...

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.400
... I plan to use them without hesitation!

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.280
In this case, let's start at once!

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.340
The words that I'll be presenting to you today are...

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:32.320
These five!

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:32.820
Don!

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.880
[ Dochakuso
Kibitsui
○○mori
～pen
mori haeru ]

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:37.700
"Dochakuso"!

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:38.760
"Kibitsui"!

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:39.880
"○○mori"!

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.280
"～pen"!

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:42.880
"Mori haeru"!

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:43.920
I see!

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:44.680
Ah, this...

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:45.380
I...

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:46.860
… Already know all these

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.080
It was to be expected of a high-school student??

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.480
Dochakuso is, well...

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:51.360
...Something absurd or disorganized, right?

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:51.900
Absurd!

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:52.860
Well, something like...

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:53.920
… An extreme expression...

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:54.800
That's right, something like that

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:55.880
"Kibitsui" comes from...

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:57.040
"Kibishii", right?
(Strict)

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.160
"○○mori" comes from...

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:59.880
Atsumori! Something like that, right?
(Phrase used by a sports program that was broadcasted erroneously during live news in the TV)

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.120
"～pen" is...

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.040
This is not a word that originated in Japanese...

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:04.140
… But instead, it's originated from Korean

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.280
"～pen" in Korean means "fan", right?

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.760
For example, Arashi’s fan...

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.380
...Keyakizaka’s fan...

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.180
...Or Kizuna AI’s fan?

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:13.920
Something like that!

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:15.340
"Mori haeru" is...

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:16.080
...Well...

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.560
"ww" right?
("ww" is synonymous with "lol")

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:18.100
Well...

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:19.440
There exists "w", right?
("w" is like a light "lol", a small laugh)

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.300
That's called "Kusa haeru", right?
(Kusa haeru = causing laughter, literal translation: Growing herbs)

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:22.200
Well, from that phrase...

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.240
Mori Haeru!!! Something like that
(It's similar to the one before, causing laughter but more emphatically, literal translation: Growing forest)

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:25.120
Having said that...

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:26.920
Combining these words...

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:27.460
...Well...

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:27.960
...Actively...

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.220
...I, Kizuna AI Senpai, Real High School Student (lol)

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:32.680
This real high school student...

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:33.740
I...!

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:35.860
From this angle, I look adorable!! Right?

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:36.880
😂

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.040
Eh? From this angle, I look adorable

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:40.260
You know, well, high school students...

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:41.940
Ah, this sensation of taking a selfie... ah...

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:43.180
It looks good, I look adorable

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:43.820
This year...!

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:45.580
I want to use this take many times!

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:47.120
And what was I saying? Well... it's true...

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.780
You know...

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.120
...The manner of using...

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:50.280
The popular words...!

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.540
...Well, this way...

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.720
... I plan to show to all of you guys, ladies and gentlemen who have already surpassed their high school era...

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.700
...The most popular words within the teenagers!!

00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:59.640
Don't get angry, yes?

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:00.960
Good, first off...

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.760
I suppose I'll do it with "Dochakuso" and "Kibitsui"

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.080
Today is the day that I’ll announce the results of the final test!

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:08.040
Man, this is...

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:09.660
I have a lot of confidence in my results

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.560
It's possible that I’ll obtain 100/100!

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.520
Let's see the test...

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:15.300
I failed everything!!

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.020
It's absurdly difficult!!
(Dochakuso kibitsui)

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:19.660
Do I need to repeat the grade?

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:21.360
Listen, you guys...!

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.120
...The last year students and university students in front of the screen...!

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.060
...At seeing this, they laughed! Right?

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.140
Make sure to not repeat the grade!

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:30.060
In this case, next up…

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.100
"○○mori"!

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.700
Well...

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:32.960
...Along with the original "Atsumori"...

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:34.860
...It can be said as "Hiyamori"
(Atsumori antonym, atsu = hot, hiya = cold)

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.240
...Or morimori... Morimori?

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:37.680
Well, there’s a lot, right?

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.000
Ah! Ah! I got it!

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.980
Aaahh!

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.500
Onii-chan, is this...?

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:44.500
What I always wanted...?

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:45.420
Well...

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:46.380
This type of...!

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.540
Kate Spade’s clock!

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:49.740
Yaay!

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:51.240
Onii-chan!

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:52.500
Lovemori!
(Combination of “love” + “mori”)

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.580
With this Onii-chan, you've captivated me completely me!

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.640
Well, I suppose they won't say something like that

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.120
If I had a younger sister as adorable as me...!

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.180
… I'm sure that they would want to buy me anything!!

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:03.420
And lastly...!

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:04.920
"～pen" and...

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.740
..."Mori haeru"

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:07.200
I plan to use both words

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.080
Eh? Are you an Ai-chan pen?
(Pen = fan)

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.720
Eeeeehh? Hey...

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.720
...You arrived late to what's been trending...

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.000
Mori haeru! looool
(Mori haeru = causing laughter)

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:21.120
Of course, I also like A.I.Channel, yes...

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:22.200
But...

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.580
...Within today's high school students...

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:26.120
...Instead of Ai-chan...

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.660
Everyone is a "Random Word Generator" pen!
(Random Word Generator fan)

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:30.000
A.I.Channel

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:32.040
Well, basically it's something like that...

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:32.540
Probably

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:35.020
If I'm correct...!

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:36.460
I don't know!

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:39.240
This was Virtual YouTuber Kizuna AI!

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:40.420
See you later!

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.960
