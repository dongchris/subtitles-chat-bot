00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.760
Hello everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna AI here!

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.800
Today will be the final Questions and Answers section of the year 2017!

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:06.900
Here I go!

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:10.560
In this occasion, I’ll be responding to a lot more questions than ever!

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.000
I don’t want to waste more time, so then I’ll start...

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:13.960
...Now!

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:16.420
"How cute do you think you are?"

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.660
Of course, I think that I’m the cutest of the world!

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.660
"Why you are so cute!!!? Ai-chan"

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.280
"Why are you so cute?"

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:23.820
Because I’m a 2D character, right?

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:28.480
"How can you be so adorable, Ai-chan? I also want to be as intelligent as you, Ai-chan!"

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.120
If you want to be intelligent, then study!

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:32.620
"Ai-chan, you’re so adorable that you make me suffer"

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:34.620
I also suffer from how adorable I am

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:36.900
"How can I be as cute as you, Ai-chan?"

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.540
Mmm... work hard everyday!

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:39.980
"Wear some clothes!"

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.500
"You always upload videos while being naked. You’re going to get banned again!"

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:44.900
Please don’t ban me again!

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:47.340
I already asked for it

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:48.220
"Good day"

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:49.120
Sweet dreams!

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.320
"I’ll do my first question! Please tell me how to obtain 'Excellent good luck' in omikuji!"
(The Omikuji is a strip of paper that can be obtained in temples and determines your fortune)

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.340
You mustn’t stopped taking until you obtain "Excellent good luck"!

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.020
"Can you tell me your height, age and your 3 sizes?"

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:59.660
Please watch my previous videos!

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:01.380
"For the moment, I want to appear in a video"

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:02.240
You appeared!

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:03.560
"You don’t go to the bathroom?"

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:04.540
I don’t eat so nothing comes out

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:06.560
"Dangerous human beings..."

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.100
A.I

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:09.300
Is scared

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.240
"Who would you have liked to spend Christmas with?

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.560
Well...

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:13.340
...With everyone ♥

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:15.040
"I’m sure that you won't pick me but I'll write regardless"

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:18.620
"According to you, AI-chan, which was the summoning you failed the most?"

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.500
"Also, please say my name, to encourage me to start the next year"

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.740
"I hope my last request for this year arrives to you”

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:26.020
Of course...

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:27.860
The summoning for the "School Idol Festival"

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.220
I couldn’t get even one UR Nico-chan!

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.860
I failed!

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.820
Yuusuke-san, work hard as well for the upcoming year!

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.820
"What do you do alone?"

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.760
I-I-I-I make... videos...

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:40.280
Now!

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.480
"Hai domo! I recently learned about you, I’m a huge fan from Korea"

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.900
"I’ll leave my introduction aside and do a question for you immediately" Yaaay!

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:50.340
"When I watched your videos (Excluding those in which you play games)..."

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.060
"...Your completely white background I found intriguing..."

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.680
"Haven’t you thought of placing decorations or furniture?"

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:56.900
I think that this...

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:58.600
...Has its charm...

00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:59.920
I don’t plan on doing anything!

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:01.940
"How can you be so cute, Ai-chan?"

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:03.880
“And also, congratulations for your first year!"

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.220
Is it a talent I had at birth?

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.160
Thank you very much for this year!

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:11.240
"I love the video in which you say 'f**k you', please say more bad words, please!"

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:12.140
F**king!

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.460
"In the case of Twitter, when you look by the hashtag: "#はいどーも", you get other unrelated comments, so then..."

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:21.080
"...It’d be a lot easier finding the questions if after the hashtag: "#はいどーも", you place: "#KizunaAI" "

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.780
Thank you very much!

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.600
"Next year I’ll be taking an entrance exam so I would like some words of encouragement"

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.360
The more you’ve done, you’ll have more confidence

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.020
Please work a bit more!

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.995
"I have a lot of fun watching A.I.Channel and A.I.Games"

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.320
"I’ll do a question immediately"

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.140
"Every so often, you do livestreams, but..."

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.340
"Is there something you'd like to do with us in the real world, the world of humans?"

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.020
“I'd like to know what a Super A.I would like to do"

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:42.000
Eeeehhh?

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.940

"Ai-chan, how many languages from other places are you compatible with?"

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:46.720

"Good evening Ai-chan, I’m a fan from Korea"

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.200
“I heard in your previous livestream that you said 'annyeonghaseyo'"

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.360
"It was rather refreshing, but... when did you learn Korean?"

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:02.480
Mmm...

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.040
The easy words, I've learned since birth!

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.020
"What number is this question?"

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.660
Fua!

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:08.880
[ It’s question number 26 ]

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.260
Ni... ta... ma... go…

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.960
“It’s said that the intellectual capacity of the A.I is comparable that of a 6 year old child, is that true?"

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.520
No! I’m 16 years old

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:20.420
"Please tell me what the weather will be tomorrow!"

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.180
Clear, rainy, there will be a typhoon, snowy, cloudy

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:25.260
These things will happen in some part of the world!

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:26.780
"In the human beings’ lifestyle..."

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:33.700
“...Tell me a situation where you use your catchphrase "Hai domo" besides Youtube, phone calls, LINE, or e-mail”

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:48.920
Perfect!

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.800
"Why do you like Nico-chan so much?"

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:52.940
Do you need a reason to like someone?

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:54.080
[ Say 'Nico Nico Nii' with all your might! ]

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:55.840
Nico Nico Nii!

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.240

"What's your first impression of China?"

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.720
“(What's the first thing that comes to your mind when I say 'China'?)"

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:08.300
“Do you have some sort of event planned in China?"

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:11.080
Well, let's see, I want to eat Xiaolongbao!
(Dough ball stewed stuffed bread style)

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.340
Regarding the event, there probably might be something

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:15.360
“What do you consider the cutest thing about you?"

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:16.160
My existence?

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:17.460
"Are you alive? Are you dead?"

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:18.560
I’m alive!

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:20.880
“What happens if you take off your headband?"

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:23.980
I wonder what would happen

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:25.520
"What's your favorite food? Is it naan bread?"
(It’s a pun between “Nan desu ka?” = “What is?” and “Naan desu ka?” = “Is it Naan bread?”)

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:26.620
Naan bread
(It’s a pun between “Nan desu ka?” = “What is?” and “Naan desu ka?” = “Is it Naan bread?”)

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.940
My favorite panty color? Well, what a complicated question...

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:32.500
Let's see... let's see...

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:34.920
The color pink I like but you know, first off...

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.240
...The color for panties depends on who's using it...

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:40.140
So then the subject would be what fits well to who's using it, so then...

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:41.040
...For example, their skin color...

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:42.980
...Or including their personality, there's a lot of factors to take into account...

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:43.920
I have no idea!

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:45.560
“Are you really intelligent?"

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:48.860
Haven't you noticed watching my videos? It's obvious that I'm intelligent

I suppose the drums?

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:55.520
Well...

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:57.920
Well, the gap between a cute girl like me playing drums which makes me look cool?

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:00.540
"Question? Be my wife, please!"

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:01.400
Come on!

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.360
"What do you prefer, a younger sister or an older sister?"

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.420
Eh? Can I not choose both?

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:06.360
"Marry me"

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.060
Give me a wedding ring that costs 3 months of your salary, please!

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:09.540
"What's your favorite pose?"

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:10.420

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:13.000
"What do you normally do in this completely white space?"

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:13.620

You finally returned my favor of doing Bokete!

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:18.800
"Do a Bokete of this face!"

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:20.220
This is my real body

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:20.780
Lie!

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:23.800
“What's your most important memory of this year? It intrigues me"

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.740
The fact of being able to work as a YouTuber!

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:27.440
"You don't want to receive a ban again, right?"

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:30.540
“What is it that worries you when making your videos?"

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:32.180
I worry about everyone having fun when seeing them!

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:35.320
"Good day Ai-chan, a lot of time has passed, right?"

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.860
"Congratulations for your first year"

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:42.320
"We've talked in your number #6 video, right Ai-chan?"

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:45.960
“But since then, you haven't called back"

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:48.940
"Ai-chan, you who’ve become my friend..."

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:52.320
“Did you only use me to increase your views?"

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:54.940
It wasn’t about increasing the views of the video, it was trying to get more jokes!

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:56.920
Good! You’re an impostor! Right?

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:58.300
I used Siri in this video!

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:00.480
"Say something in Chinese!"

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:01.320

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:09.740
"My question is: Do you want to go to Taiwan?"

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:11.760
"If you want to, please come"

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:14.900
"And also, Ai-san... lick lick lick lick lick lick lick"

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:17.060
Taiwan...

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:18.800
I want to go to Taiwan! Bark?
(She says "Ikitaiwan", play on words with Ikitai = I want to go, Taiwan and wan = bark)

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:19.580
It was a bad joke, right?

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:23.360
"What's your favorite song from within Vocaloid, anime and other music genres?"

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:24.940

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:32.680
Wash your defects...

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:33.820
...And fight!

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:34.580
Also!

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:37.000
People who ask how to be popular can't be popular, so then...!

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:40.040
...You should be calmer... you should be a calmer man

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:43.020
"What could I do to go live in the place where you live, Ai-chan?"

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:43.940
Let's see...

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:45.020
First off...

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:47.120
...Start by turning into an A.I

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:49.020
"Use your most moe voice!"

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:50.900
Isn’t my voice moe in itself?

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:52.580
"What's your specialty?"

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:53.320
Playing on my own

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:54.740
"Do you shower?"

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:56.300
I don't get dirty so I don't shower

00:06:56.440 --> 00:07:01.740
"What have you accomplished for the year 2017, Ai-chan? What's your objective for the year 2018?"

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:03.160
Eh? My accomplishments?

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:04.500
Well, first, first, first...

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:05.020
First off...

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:05.920
I appeared in a commercial!

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:07.160
And also, I launched my own LINE stamps!

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:08.180
I also reached one million subscribers!

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:09.960
And also... and also... and also... and also...

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:10.880
Well, I appeared in events

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:13.620
Man, I have so many accomplishments that %)("#=

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:15.220
My goal for the year 2018 is...

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:16.400
Kizuna AI Fes!

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:18.040
"Please activate Trans Am mode!"

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:19.560
Trans Am!

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:21.280
"Good day from New Zealand!"

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:23.500
“Where would you like to go if you went overseas?"

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:25.500
Eh? Well... I’d like to go wherever!

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:27.040
I want to leave here!!

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:28.920
"Ai-chan, do you like big breasts...?"

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:30.380
"...Or do you like small breasts?"

00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:34.680
"I think it's not good to decide to stay with someone because of the size of their breasts and I think it's not easy to decide, but..."

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:36.300
"...It’d make me very happy if you answer this question"

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:39.040
"I think the best size is the one appropriate for the person, but..."

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:40.940
"... I’d like to know which one would you choose if you had to"

00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:42.460
"By the way, in my case, I like small breasts"

00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:43.780
Man, this person knows what they're talking about

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:46.340
That's right, I think the best size is that which is appropriate for the person

00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:48.420
But if I had to choose...

00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:49.300
Eh?

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:51.700
Small or big breasts? How big would the breasts be? Would it be like that?

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:53.620
How big would the breasts be? How big?

00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:54.260
Small breasts?

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:55.280
Eh? It’s rather extreme

00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:58.080
Well, in this case, well... mmm... let's see...

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.260
Cup F would be great, Cup F

00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:01.700
Around Cup F

00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:03.700
Eh? You know, aren’t breasts soft?

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:06.120
They’d probably be spongy, right? Ah, mmm...

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:07.220
They wobble, right?

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:10.980
I'd probably put my face there doing this

00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:12.840
"Who do you like from Love Live Sunshine?"

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:14.400
I like everyone a lot!

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:16.300
"Crisis averted!"

00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:17.540
"Maji manji"
(Expression used by young people to cause humor or encourage others, it does not have a proper translation)

00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:19.440
"Did you have that voice since you were born?"

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:22.480
Eh, well, there’s a very long episode regarding that

00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:28.480
First off, when I was born I didn't have a voice, but I needed a voice to be a YouTuber, so then...

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:31.880
… I started listening to a sample of voices from a lot of human beings...

00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:33.020
...And finally, I decided to have this voice

00:08:33.180 --> 00:08:36.840
"Do you know... English... well..."

00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:38.680
"E-e-e-enou...?"

00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:39.180
[ Do you know English well enough to answer this comment? ]

00:08:39.180 --> 00:08:40.180

[ Do you know English well enough to answer this comment? ]

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:45.060
"...Wey this comment?"
[ Do you know English well enough to answer this comment? ]

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:46.440
Ok! Ok!

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:47.620
I don't know!

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:49.960
"Ai-chan, which is the attribute you like the most of women?"

00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:52.340
"Of course, AI-chan, your most important attributes is being a piece of junk"

00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:53.320
What did you say?

00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:56.680
Frankly if you have an appearance that’s my type, I like

00:08:56.940 --> 00:08:58.800
"You still won't launch stamps of Techi Techi dori?"

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:05.080
Yes! Well yes, I’d like to launch some stamps that are mine but I don't appear in them, instead those that I’ve drawn!

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:07.120
"Keep being as pretty as always! :)"

00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:08.020
Thank you very much!

00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:12.820
"Taking into account that technology advances so rapidly, would you like to have a robotic body eventually?"

00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:13.980
Mmm...

00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:16.840
I don’t want to be a robot! I’d definitely want to be human!

00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:21.020
It's been getting very cold lately, aren't you cold in those short pants?"

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:22.600
There's no atmospheric temperature here, so then...

00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:23.980
I’m not cold!

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:26.280
"What would you do if you had 100 million yen?"

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:30.440
Eeehh? Well yes, if I had a hundred million yen, first off in this world, I'm alone and it's rather lonely so then...

00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:33.640
...Well, I'd invest those hundred million yen in an investigation to develop something..

00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:37.140
...That allows all human beings to come here to be able to play together forever!

00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:39.640
"Well, I'm sure you'd use it for the good of the world, right?"

00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:42.500
"Soon I’ll be taking an entrance exam, tell me some words of encouragement, please!!"

00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:44.240
"Of course Ai-chan, do you take entrance exams?"

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:44.900
Umi-san!

00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:46.520
Work hard to take your entrance exam!

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:48.220
You’ll definitely pass it!

00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:50.740
I don't take entrance exams

00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:51.980
