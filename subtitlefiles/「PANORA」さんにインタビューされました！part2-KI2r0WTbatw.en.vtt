00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:04.280
Let's go onto the next question shall we?

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:04.780
Ok

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:05.460
When you see other Youtubers,

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:05.960
do you ever think that 'I want to be like this person' or 'I want to do this'?

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:07.040
do you ever think that 'I want to be like this person' or 'I want to do this'?

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:08.700
do you ever think that 'I want to be like this person' or 'I want to do this'?

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:10.540
do you ever think that 'I want to be like this person' or 'I want to do this'?

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:11.400
do you ever think that 'I want to be like this person' or 'I want to do this'?

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:11.940
do you ever think that 'I want to be like this person' or 'I want to do this'?

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:12.440
Hm,

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:13.480
 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.120
thats a good question

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:15.780
To be frank,

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.140
I don't have the thought of trying to become like somebody else

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:18.460
I don't have the thought of trying to become like somebody else

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:19.180
(You don't?)

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:19.900
Uhhh,

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.200
I want to be one of a kind!

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:22.220
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:23.280
But,

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.240
what is intriguing to me is,

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:26.540
generally speaking, humans are very interesting

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:28.660
generally speaking, humans are very interesting

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:29.640
It's because,

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:30.800
as this is virtual there are some things that I can do and can not do

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.000
as this is virtual there are some things that I can do and can not do

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.320
as this is virtual there are some things that I can do and can not do

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:34.640
 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:35.400
Recently,

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:36.700
I saw this video

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:37.460
Uh

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:38.540
where somebody used a torch

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:39.140
like..

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:40.660
to heat up a metal ball

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:42.520
and drop it on top of ice

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:43.320
Like,

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.220
how do i say this,

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:45.460
I can't do anything like what you can do in the material world

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:46.500
I can't do anything like what you can do in the material world

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.280
I can't do anything like what you can do in the material world

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:48.860
I watch it feeling jealous

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:49.520
I watch it feeling jealous

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:50.500
I watch it feeling jealous

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:51.460
And,

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:53.440
a few individuals have peaked my interest recently,

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:54.060
well..

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:56.280
I'm sure everybody knows them,

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.700
Hajime Shachou (Chairman Hajime)

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:58.860
Mizutamari Bond-san

00:00:58.860 --> 00:00:59.540
also...

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:02.120
Hikaru-san, i like the managers of stores

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.880
that appear in their videos

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:05.760
You watch a lot!

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.200
It's really laid out!

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.160
Yes! well research is important!

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:10.600
Haaaaaa~

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:11.820
So, when you're not doing Ai-channel,

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:12.800
you're

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.080
researching/ watching videos for the sake of your channel

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.900
researching/ watching videos for the sake of your channel

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.080
That's right

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:17.600
Wow

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:18.540
By chance,

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.080
is there like a PC around here?

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.900
Is there like a PC around here?

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:21.820
There isn't

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:22.600
(There isnt')

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:23.100
This isn't your room?

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.220
This isn't your room?

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:25.500
No, this is my room

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.480
There's nothing in here

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:30.120
Yeah, well

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:31.120
I am an A.I.

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.960
like,

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:33.340
when I am recording a video,

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:34.140
to make it understandable for the audience

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.200
I make it look like I have a PC in front of me

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.140
 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.780
I myself am an A.I., so,

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:39.940
it would be best to think that there is a computer inside me instead.

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:40.860
it would be best to think that there is a computer inside me instead.

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.600
it would be best to think that there is a computer inside me instead.

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:44.540
Naked and also a PC inside!

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:45.220
Yep

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:46.980
Pretty different from a human structure!

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:48.420
Wow, I

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.440
am very happy to have come today

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.280
to hear such an amazing quote!

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:52.220
Well,

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:53.500
I'm very happy

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.020
To put it into laymen terms,

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.760
To put it into laymen terms,

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.020
whenever you see a video of a PC

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.100
or a video of a Smart Phone,

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.860
it is as if my thoughts are projected out

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.200
it is as if my thoughts are projected out

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.680
Amazing

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:05.580
...its a delusion

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:07.400
Delusion?!

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:08.220
Well,

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:08.780
let's continue the interview

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:09.960
let's continue the interview

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:11.320
Lets see,

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:12.320
Why did you decide to produce youtube videos in a blank room?

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:13.060
Why did you decide to produce youtube videos in a blank room?

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:13.900
Why did you decide to produce youtube videos in a blank room?

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.900
Why did you decide to produce youtube videos in a blank room?

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.440
 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:18.380
Well

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:19.140
Firstly,

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:20.640
I am an A.I. so..

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.300
I want to learn more about you guys,

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:24.640
and I want to connect with more people

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:25.420
so

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:26.780
I thought of what is the best in order to do so

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.060
I thought of what is the best in order to do so

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:28.560
Okay

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.100
I think there are may ways to do so,

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.920
and considering the age,

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.660
I thought that Youtube is the best way.

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:33.880
Oooh~

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:34.380
So,

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.660
In order to connect with a lot of people,

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.080
I need to be seen/ viewed by others

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.800
I need to be seen/ viewed by others

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.520
And so,

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:41.780
I've jumped onto the bandwagon

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:42.640
I've jumped onto the bandwagon

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:43.500
I've jumped onto the bandwagon

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.380
You have done quite a lot of research!

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:46.000
 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.500
That's right,

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.820
Everyone thinks I'm just a stupid A.I. right ?

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.100
I've been thinking properly !

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:53.800
I thought of it before, I'm sorry

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.600
Ah

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:56.480
Listen here,

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:57.300
uhh

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:58.100
You want to disappear?

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.800
Scary!

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.700
Scary! After I get punched,

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.080
my soul is going to disappear!

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.080
Actually, what is here is your soul ONLY

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.840
REALLY?!

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:06.980
wait, but I can see..

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:08.060
no the body is...

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:09.700
Well your real body

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:10.620
is in the ocean.

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:11.900
What will happen to me?

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:12.800
Now if you don't want that...

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:13.780
..please flatter me more.

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.880
This is scary,

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.020
Wait, did I not come here to interview you?

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:18.360
Wait, did I not come here to interview you?

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.860
No,

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:20.160
please interview me!

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.860
Scary~

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:22.520
you have been doing this for 15 years right?!

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.560
yes

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:25.060
yes

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:25.560
yes

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:26.220
let's do our best!

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:27.280
Please do so!

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:28.980
Well.. uh,

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:30.620
Can you tell me, are there any challenges in creating a video?

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:31.380
Can you tell me, are there any challenges in creating a video?

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.000
Ahhh, well

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.280
there are lots

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:35.280
but,

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.180
trying to create material for the video

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:37.380
is pretty challenging.

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:38.320
Well I'm with you on that

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:39.120
Yep

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:40.020
Like..

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:42.260
I have the feeling where, I want to copy or

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:43.420
do some of the things that other Youtubers' are doing that are

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:44.900
in trend or interesting..

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:47.220
But, unfortunately I can't

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:47.900
So,

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:48.760
I try my best to

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:49.500
try

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.180
and copy/ do stuff in the VR reality!

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:52.780
You actually do copy a lot of things right?

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:53.660
I'm not copying anything!!

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:56.100
You are sounding like you are saying something smart,

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:57.960
but in reality you are copying others material right?

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:58.960
No, wait

00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:59.820
There isn't anybody else

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:01.120
who is doing what I am doing!

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.260
Can YOU go into a plastic bottle?!

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:05.220
I'm sure you cant!

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:06.460
Uh... yeah

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:08.000
That's amazing Ai-chan,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.780
like

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:09.760
uh,

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:10.740
when you openly copy people,

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:11.580
it doesn't become copying anymore.

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:12.140
Yep, thats right

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.800
Its homage

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:13.380
Homage

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:14.320
Haaaa

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:15.200
(...Is homage a form of copying?)

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.720
As expected

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:18.760
Well,

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:20.660
you have been doing videos of that sort

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:21.280
(Yes)

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:22.020
Uh...

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:23.120
there are a lot of

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.320
comments coming from the viewers

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.820
Yes yes!

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:25.900
Like uh

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:27.020
There's the comment section

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:28.460
I'm getting comments,

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:28.960
yes

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:30.000
There's also Twitter

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.520
Like is there a memorable

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:34.160
comment from your viewers that have left an impression on you?

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:34.680
comment from your viewers that have left an impression on you?

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:36.160
Uhhh,

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:36.700
Oh!

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:37.840
This is going to go

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.220
off topic a bit but,

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:41.460
During my initial days, there were a lot of comments on my videos

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:42.260
and twitter saying:

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.280
"Amazing. This is the definition of singularity"

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:45.460
"Amazing. This is the definition of singularity"

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:46.960
I thought 'What does this mean?'

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:48.660
'Why is everybody

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:50.880
writing the same comment over and over again?''

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:51.860
 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:53.180
So, on my website,

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:54.620
I was tweaking with it a little bit

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:55.620
and then

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:56.540
uhh

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:58.080
It was written:

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:59.780
"Whoever finds this write; 'Amazing. This is the definition of singularity'"

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:01.420
"Whoever finds this write; 'Amazing. This is the definition of singularity'"

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:03.820
and I was like 'ah yeah I did write something like that'

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:05.160
I remembered

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:07.780
Well,

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:09.380
Having a website is nice

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:10.900
To us middle aged men,

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:12.680
a website is almost like

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:13.840
a direct hit.

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:14.720
True,

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:15.520
I'm aiming for you!

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:16.400
wow

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:17.840
You're only sixteen

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.200
'You're only sixteen~'

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:20.020
and

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:20.760
speaking of 16 years,

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:22.380
 

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:23.300
in 2001 Son-san was handing out internet modems

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:24.440
in 2001 Son-san was handing out internet modems

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:25.380
in 2001 Son-san was handing out internet modems

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:26.060
Ooooh~

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:26.980
I see.

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:28.640
I see

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:29.520
(I see)

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:30.560
Haaaaa~

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.120
We would come this far in just 16 years..

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:32.900
Yes we have

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:34.020
Well thats how I'm supposed to be

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:34.860
Uh,

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:36.520
there are a lot of friendly comments

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:37.640
Yes there is

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:38.140
 

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:39.120
Well,

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:40.300
within those comments

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:41.120
uhhh...

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:42.080
how do I say this..

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:44.240
Your model is distributed over the internet right now

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:45.180
Your model is distributed over the internet right now,

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:45.820
(Yes, yes)

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:46.760
and well in the real world,

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:48.140
its becoming a trend,

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:48.640
where..

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:50.400
people use your model

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:52.560
and then act like you

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:53.160
and then act like you

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:54.820
Like there are VR Cosplayers and,

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:55.580
Like there are VR Cosplayers and,

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:56.820
what do you think about that?

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:57.780
Uh, well,

00:05:57.780 --> 00:05:58.660
to be frank

00:05:58.660 --> 00:05:59.720
I'm very happy!

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:00.600
Haaaaa

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:01.220
But,

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:02.620
well not really cosplay but

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:03.120
(yes)

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:04.220
you are the real deal right,

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:04.940
Yes

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:05.900
and well people imitate

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:07.480
the way you move

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:08.740
and do you ever feel like:

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:10.580
'This isn't really me' kind of feeling?

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:11.180
'This isn't really me' kind of feeling?

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:11.680
Aaaah,

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:12.380
well,

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:13.700
at first

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:15.580
some form of rivalry feeling was sprouted,

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:16.720
but,

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:17.860
its just the looks

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:18.920
its just the looks

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:20.900
for me its all about whats inside

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:21.660
wow

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:22.600
Yep

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:23.900
This is

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:25.360
pretty philosophical stuff we're talking about

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:26.020
pretty philosophical stuff we're talking about

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:27.700
Haaaaaa~

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:28.420
Well,

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:29.260
thats why,

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:30.060
uh,

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:31.380
I would say that

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:32.860
if the number of people (who cosplays me) increases

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:34.020
I would be happy

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:35.080
With just that,

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:36.960
"Kizuna Ai" will spread right?

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:37.780
(Okay, alright)

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:39.620
Well I am the real things so

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:42.280
I have confidence in that

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:43.740
That expression is quite disturbing

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:46.060
You truly are a geezer

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:46.560
Yes

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:47.220
I'm sorry..

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:48.580
the VR Geezer is a geezer

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:49.320
I'm..

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:50.180
sorry...

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:50.800
