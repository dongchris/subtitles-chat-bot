00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.100
Phil: Hey everyone, welcome to another episode of...

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:05.120
All: Comments In Cars! (laughter)

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:08.140
Phil: For those of you that don't know, this is our show

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:10.900
where we respond to the comments that you guys leave on our videos.

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:13.160
It's been a while since we did our first one

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.320
but we thought we would try to catch back up.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.540
We thought we'd respond to the comments on our BgA video!
Jun &amp; Wes: woo! Yayy

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:22.900
Phil: For Dong Saya Dae 
Wes: Boys Generally Asian!

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.000
Phil: We obviously had to bring in one of the members of BgA...

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.400
JunCurryAhn!

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:28.420
(stock children cheer sfx)
Jun: Hello!

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:31.600
Phil: So we're really glad that Jun's here to be on this episode.

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.160
Let's just jump right in and read some comments!

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:34.940
Jun: tillydancer101 says,

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:40.980
Wes: Wow!

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.520
Phil: Yeah? I would love for that to happen!

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.180
Wes: I was actually very surprised of how many reaction videos there were.

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.840
Jun: K-pop music video reactions are, like, its own category on YouTube, pretty much.

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.340
Phil: And so them reacting to us basically made us seem like we were a legit

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.500
K-pop video?! (laughs)
Jun: We're a legit K-pop video! People probably saw

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.380
the reaction videos and thought, like, "oh, who's this new group that I haven't seen?"

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:59.380
Phil: Oh my god!
Wes: I-I watched a good amount of them.

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:02.580
Do you think there's some actual K-pop groups that saw the video?

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:07.440
Jun: I'm pretty sure there are. I'm pretty sure BTS saw it, cause we're their #1 competition.

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.000
Wes: Oh-ho-ho!
Phil: (laughs) 
(Clip of BTS saying "ow!")

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Phil: Oh, I forgot to say! I'm wearing my BgA hat!

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:14.740
Phil: (laughs)

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:16.520
Uh, we'll--we'll get you a hat.

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:17.620
Wes: Chick-pop says...

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.020
Phil: I don't know, man...

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.500
Jun: I think we did make it to the K-pop charts, though, on iTunes.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.000
Phil: Right! We did!

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.840
Jun: I think we hit #1 for a little bit, for a few seconds.
Phil: Oh my God!

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.220
Jun: We beat BTS...
Phil: Oh, man.

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:31.880
Jun: ...for like a good three hours.

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.060
Phil: (laughs)

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.880
Wes: The Dee asks, "who wrote these beautiful lyrics?"

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.520
Phil: The lyrics were written by Ryan and David, actually.

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.520
Obviously a lot of thought went into it.

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.580
for such poetic lines and words.

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:45.820
Jun: No, it's very hard to make it so random.

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:48.720
My favorite was, um, "we are sexy naengmyeon" (cold noodles)

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:49.560
Phil: Oh yes.

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.300
Jun: Rei's Waifu (chuckles) says,

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.420
Phil: Oh man!
Jun: "David Choi dance"

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.080
Phil: David Choi Dance is legendary. I don't know where it first showed up,

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.880
but we had it in the "Dance to this Song" music video, like years ago?
Wes: And even then it was a signature move.

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.280
Phil: (laughs) Right.
Jun: The truth behind it, is

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.820
we had actual choreo there, planned,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.120
but then, by that time we were all like,

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.680
"Guys, we can't do more."
Phil: Well, let's be honest here, actually.

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.000
If you look at us behind them, we were doing like the good bit 
Jun: The actual choreo

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
and then we were like "okay, David, Ryan, and Justin.. (Phil: uhh you just-) ..we're just gonna do the David Choi Dance"

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.500
Phil: yea you just do that

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:32.000
Phil: that wasn't an extension, I, I've been growing that out for two years

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.400
I didn't even know if this video was happening, I was just like "someday, this might be needed"

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:36.500
I've been tucking it away

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:37.000
Wes: Where is it now?

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Phil: (laughs) it's under this hat

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.500
Phil: what, wait what is - ?
Jun: a BGA lightstick

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.500
so like, kpop fandoms, like fan groups, like they make their own, (Phil: ooohh) lightsticks

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.200
like BTS, for example, is like uhh, like a ball, like a lantern

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.500
Phil: and the BIGBANG is (Jun: the flower) the flower
Jun: yea yea yea the -

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.200
Phil: how does -
Wes: cause when I first read that comment, it just sounded kinda dirty (laughter)

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Jun: what would the BGA lightstick be though? (Phil: it would be - ) oh poop!

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Phil: it would be poop! it would be the poop emoji!
Jun: just the poop emoji!

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Wes: that's actually pretty good

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.100
Phil: everyone's at the concert just throwing poop

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:17.100
Wes: a "stan" is like a fan, based off the Eminem song, Stan

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:22.000
Phil: (gasps) ohh is that what it is? like I thought that it was like a "stance" that someone takes
Wes: no no no it's like a mega fan

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.500
Jun: there's also other terms like "bias"
Phil: and there's also "trash" too

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:30.500
Jun: there's trash, trash is, they're referring to themselves, they're like "oh my gosh I'm Ryan trash"

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.500
which means like "I love Ryan so much I've become trash"
Wes: what?!

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.200
Phil: it's like "ugh" (Jun: yea like) they're, they're self-aware of how gross it is
Jun: yea

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.700
"bias" is like their favorite one, right, and there's "bias wrecker"

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:45.900
Phil: I learn so many things reading the comments about the culture of (Jun: kpop) current kpop, yea

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:50.200
I saw that you are a lot of people's bias but once in a while, I was the bias wrecker, Jun

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:55.000
Jun: which means they like me, but then they like Phil enough that (Phil laughs) he might become the bias

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.400
it's like it's
Phil: it's like a "might"

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.368
(ominous music) 
Jun: "I, I really like this guy but this guy is making me change my mind" (Phil laughs)

00:04:00.368 --> 00:04:03.000
and that guy that's making them change their mind is the bias wrecker

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.500
Phil: ooh the drama, the kdrama

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:08.500
hey instead of calling yourselves "trash" we should call you guys "recyclables"

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.500
that way it's like a positive thing

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
Wes: cause it's-
Phil: "lowkey"??
Jun: "lowkey" it's highkey lit

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.500
Phil: what're you -
Jun: it's fire
Phil: it was [beep] legit lit on fire

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.000
by the way, we're driving to get lunch right now, okay, so we're not just driving to drive

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.200
so every so often, there is a comment that is just so good and special that it deserves an award

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:34.200
Jun: the first Mega Kpop Fan-Stan Award goes to Briggie Schrunk, she said (ominous music)

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.800
some of these, I have no idea about but like part-switch version for example like I can switch parts with you for the entire song 
Wes: wow

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.800
Phil: oh cause they wanna see their bias do the other stuff
Jun: yea other parts and stuff
Phil: oh my

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:58.800
Jun: name tag version where we dance like, like a wide-shot but then we all have our name tags on so 
Phil: why?

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:02.200
Jun: so people can follow who's who, I don't know
Phil: (laughs) oh my god

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:06.400
Jun: there's eye contact version so it's like close-ups the entire time so imagine the dance practice video

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.400
(Phil: (laughs) oh my god) but just close-ups and we have to look in the camera

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:09.700
Phil: hey we have those shots

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:13.400
that person definitely deserves that award, I like how she or he started out by saying "okay"

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.700
like there was like "this was fine"
