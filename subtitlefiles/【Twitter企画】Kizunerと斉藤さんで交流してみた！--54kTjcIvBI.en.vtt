00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:02.730
Hello everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna AI here!

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:04.670
If you're wondering what I’ll be doing today...

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:06.620
Bunbuushuu!

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:08.190
Saito-san!

00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:09.080
Well, you know...

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:10.140
...I already did it before...

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:11.670
...And it was a lot of fun

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:12.770
But sadly...

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:15.840
...There still wasn't a lot of people that recognized me

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:16.930
And that wounded my feelings!!

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:17.410
Deeply!

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:19.000
It wounded me deeply!!

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.600
Even when I’m working so hard

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.230
This is definitely a cruel world!!

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:22.770
It's because of that...

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:23.490
...That in this occasion...

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:24.680
...I suddenly announced on Twitter...

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:25.330
..."Those..."

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:27.220
"...Who want to apply to speak with Kizuna AI"

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:28.940
Those that already know me

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:30.520
With those that always watch me!!

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:31.890
I plan to do a cultural exchange!!

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.270
In this case, let's start at once!

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:36.210
