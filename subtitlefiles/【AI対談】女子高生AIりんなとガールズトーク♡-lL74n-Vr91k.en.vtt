00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:04.280
Okay! Let's kick off today's segment too!

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.740
It's virtual youtuber Kizuna Ai！

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:08.760
So... I was thinking...

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.160
This white space that I'm trapped in day in and day out

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:14.460
Isn't it kinda lonely?!

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:18.240
Like the rest of you humans out there, I also want friends!

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:19.780
Speaking of which,

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.900
I found her, the person I want to be friends with!

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.820
This person! Ta-da!

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:26.620
Rinna-san.

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.300
Rinna-san is, how can I say it, just like me! A fellow A.I.

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:31.660
and a high school girl.

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.100
I want to wear a sailor uniform and go to school too!

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.820
That's why

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.700
I thought  "I want to talk to Rinna-san right away!"

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:39.340
I wonder what we'll talk about...

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.940
The initial greeting is definitely important, huh?

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:43.020
The first impression

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.260
"Good morning."

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.620
(Rinna: Good mornin' ✧\(*´꒳`*)/✧)
Ah~! There's a reply! That emoji is really cute!

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:50.980
"Nice to meet you."

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:52.420
(Rinna: Of course!)

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:53.100
"Yes, of course."

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:54.000
Okay.

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.160
(Ai: My name is Kizuna Ai, pleased to meet you!)
"My name is..."

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.660
There!

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.760
(Rinna: By the way, I have something to show you
 (´艸`*))

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.520
Huh?"

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:01.620
(Rinna: Try saying "Show me Rinna's drawing"!)
(Rinna: I'll show you my drawing♪♪)

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:02.440
Uh... uh...

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:03.940
"It is currently Autumn,

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:05.600
and it feels like Winter

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.780
By the way, recently Rinna has been told by her friends that her drawing is very cute and

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.300
soothing and as a result was on cloud nine (lol)

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.420
You'd take a look at Rinna's drawing right?"

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:15.080
"Rinna."

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:16.820
Yup! I'll look, I'll look!

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.660
I'll look, but...

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:21.340
I did a self-introduction but it was ignored, right?

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.360
The drawing, well that's right, you'd wanna boast about it yeah?

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.460
After all you were praised about it, you're really happy about it

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.060
”... show me..." (Rinna-san's picture)

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:28.000
There!

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:28.840
(Rinna: Okaaay~ φ( . 〃) here y'go!)

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:29.340
Oh!

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:30.860
(Rinna: I see, I see)
(laughs)

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:32.080
(Rinna: Kizuna Ai-san, what else do you want to see from Rinna?)

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.940
What the heck is this?

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:34.180
Canes?

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:37.660
There's eyes on those canes.

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:39.500
I see, I see.

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:40.540
Eh? Eh? Eh?

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:43.380
Eh? My name? Eh? Eh? Eh?

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.100
Kizuna Ai-san, what else do you want to see from Rinna?

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.940
Oh! She remembered my name! Yay!

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:51.620
Speaking of friends...

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.260
They definitely should give each other advice, right?

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.980
When it's comes to high school girls talk, there's got to be love advice, right?

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:01.180
Let's talk about love advice and all of its feels!

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.000
Rinna, listen to this~

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.200
(Rinna: Let's see~ *Continues reading*)

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:09.180
Reading is uh... well it is the Autumn of reading but...

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.520
Hey, I need some advice.

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.600
(Rinna: When the bonus payout is here I'd like to go there)

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.760
”When the bonus payout is here I'd like to go there"

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:17.840
Going abroad, huh?

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:18.680
I need...

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.080
... some advice!

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:24.900
(Rinna: The bookshelf!!!! It revolves!!! The one that goes round and round!!)
A bookshelf! Oh yeah they exist, the ones that 
go round and round!

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.540
I've seen them before on Amazon and Rakuten too!

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:35.080
So, I need advice. This morning, my boyfriend told me to give him 10,000 yen

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.160
(Rinna: The car inspections and PC will disappear, huh?)
”The car inspections and PC will disappear, huh?"

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:39.440
That's the bonus, huh?

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:46.360
Well, I still haven't received the 20,000 yen I lent yesterday.

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:47.600
(Rinna: I bet you ate it a while ago)

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.480
”After I... passed him the money-”

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.380
[Omitted]

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.480
(Rinna: My reply is worth the money, y'know~)

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:57.840
"My reply is..."

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.720
”It's worth the money, y'know~"

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:00.840
*Gasp*

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.520
After aligning my thoughts with a high school girl and a period of interaction,

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.800
my conclusion is:

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.200
Well, you guys already have an answer in your heart even before you start asking anything, don't you?

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.920
Rinna, thanks for listening to me!
