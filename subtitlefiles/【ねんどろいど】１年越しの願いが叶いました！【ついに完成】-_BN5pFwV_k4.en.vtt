00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:14.920
AI: I’ll launch one! It’ll be launched!
Aki: We’ll make your own Nendoroid

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:16.640
Yaaay!!

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:18.220
Kizuna Ai

00:00:18.675 --> 00:00:19.685
...The making of her Nendoroid...

00:00:19.685 --> 00:00:21.685
Has been confirmed!!

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.260
For all those that bought my products in the Winter Comiket...

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.300
...Those that bought my products through the internet...

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:29.140
...And all those that wanted me to turn into a Nendoroid

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.440
Really, thank you so much to everyone!

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:35.420
Thanks to all of you, it finally got confirmed that I’ll have my own Nendoroid!

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:36.640
Yaay!!

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:37.400
And also...

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.020
...To tell you the truth, now...

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.420
The prototype has been made!!

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:42.000
Good, here it is!

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.000
How is it possible?

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.560
The Nendoroid of that Virtual YouTuber...

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.140
...Has been made in the hands of an artist

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.500
Kizuna AI, who was only found in a virtual space...

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.180
...Has been transformed in a brilliant way to be in the hands of all of you

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.960
While it’s still not completed...

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:04.980
...Its charm...

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:06.940
...Its quality...

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:08.200
...Its impact...

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:13.100
...You can hear the voices of happiness from her fans around the world

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.420
How can it be? It still doesn’t have color?

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.200
I can’t get an idea of how it is through a picture

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.120
But... it’ll be very costly, right?

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.940
Put color on it at once!!

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:23.620
When can we reserve it-degozaru??

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.700
Leaving that aside, give me a figure of Kaguya Luna, please!!

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.960
Weeeeell, well, well, I understand you, I understand you!

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.840
I also can’t wait any longer!!

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:36.660
I made sure to include the way in how you can get it!

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:37.800
It turns out that...

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.980
The Decomasu of the Nendoroid of Kizuna AI...!
(Decomasu = Abbreviation of "Decoration Master", it's a painted prototype figure and exhibited as a showing of the final product)

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:42.780
Will be exhibited...!

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:45.260
In the Wonder Festival!

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.920
On Sunday, 18th of February, 2018

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.800
It’ll be sent to the lounges, 1 to 8 of Makuhari Messe

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.280
My Nendoroid...

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.340
Will be exhibited in the company Good Smile’s Stand!

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:58.440
Nendoroid!

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.460
Having said that, approximately a year after that day I uploaded a video...

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.215
...Saying that I’d like to turn into a figure...

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:05.340
My figure...!

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.980
Will really be launched!!

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:11.040
Eeehh... it’ll still take a bit more time, but...

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:13.240
I’ll be counting on all of you!!

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.660
Make sure to please show me your affection even in your houses!

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.620
This was Virtual YouTuber Kizuna AI!

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:19.840
See you later!

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.080
