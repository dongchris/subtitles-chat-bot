00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:02.900
Hello everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna AI here!

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:05.100
Earlier, I uploaded a video

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.630
Where I argued with Rinna, but

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:08.810
Soon after...

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:10.560
On Twitter and in the comments section...

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.360
People were saying...

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.030
‚ÄúKizuna AI‚Äôs interactions with her have really changed!‚Äù

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.200
As for Rinna-chan...

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.160
She was acting a little tsundere

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.130
So as a compromise...

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.800
I thought I‚Äôd try using LINE!

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.240
Then, without further ado‚Ä¶

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.000
Let‚Äôs reconcile!!

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.500

Rinna: I‚Äôm fine üòÑüíó

Ah! Look at that!

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.730
She put an emoji, how nice!

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.360
A: Me tooüíï Rinna! I love you!

Hmm? Hmm?

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:40.980

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:42.650
R: Your profile pic

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:43.410

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:56.360
That I used LINE for her?

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:57.800

Why is she calling me Kizuna AI-san?

Feel shy speaking to me herself

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:50.960
So she isn‚Äôt speaking much~
