00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:02.660
Hello everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai here!

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:07.900
Do all of you know about the information Apple gave at announcing the new iPhoneX a few days ago?

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:11.020
Apple-san is the respectable father that gave birth to Siri-senpai, so then...

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.100
...It seems interesting, right?

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.200
It looks to be very efficient!!

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.820
Although...

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:17.800
I think I wouldn’t lose against her

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:18.780
It's because of that, that today...

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:20.360
Between the efficient iPhoneX...

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.300
And the super A.I, Kizuna Ai

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:25.020
I plan to do a versus to determine who is the most amazing

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:26.760
In this case, let's start at once!

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:28.900
A.I.Channel!

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:29.820
Transmission

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:30.680
Now...!

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:32.620
I’ll show you the points of the competition!

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:33.200
♪ Te, ren! ♪

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.400
*Price  *Size
*Recharging function   *Accesories
*Durability  *Facial Recognition

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.480
First off, the iPhoneX’s price!

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.860
112,800 yens (Without tax)
*Around 995 USD*

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:43.260
Translated in words of the game "LoveLive! School idol festival"...

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.460
It’s more than 1900 gems Loveca!!
(Summoning gems)

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.460
You can do 38 summoning of 11 characters each!!

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:49.480
In comparison...

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.140
.. My price?

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:52.880
My price is...

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.000
Hmm...

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.600
You all can see my videos freely, right?

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.080
Isn't that extremely inexpensive?

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:01.340
Next up, the weight!

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.520
It’s said that the iPhoneX is extremely efficient...

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.940
But due to that, it must be heavier, right?

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:08.980
Let's see...

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.020
The iPhoneX’s weight is...

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:13.640
174 grams!

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.060
iPhone7 weighs 138 grams!

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.040
The iPhone7 Plus weighs 188 grams

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:20.140
That means...

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.040
It's heavier than the traditional ones but it’s lighter than the Plus model, right?

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:25.960
In comparison, my weight is...

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.680
...46 kilograms ♥

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.980
But by being virtual...

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:31.380
I don’t have any weight!!

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:32.220
It’s just an appearance

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.360
If you ask me why I decided it to be 46 kilos...

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:35.480
As you can see from my height...

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:37.600
It’s 1 meter and 56 centimeters

00:01:37.605 --> 00:01:38.800
And my three sizes are...

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.220
Bust: 85

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:41.960
Waist: 59

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.060
Hip: 83, right?

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.400
And if I existed in reality, a person with the same figure...

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.220
...I calculated that they’d have a weight of 46 kilograms (?)

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:52.060
Hohoho!

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.520
Well, if I use my processing power...

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.300
A calculation of these characteristics is a piece of cake

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.240
I definitely have the best weight!

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:02.760
Eh? What are we talking about?

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.220
Recharging function!

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:06.260
I see, I see...

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:07.680
The iPhoneX...

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:10.200
Can be recharged wirelessly...

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.700
If you place the iPhoneX on top of the white recharging device...

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.600
It recharges automatically

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.200
Hmm... ooohhh... that is pretty amazing, right?

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.820
But in this, I’m also very amazing

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:24.040
It turns out that while I remain in this completely white space...!

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.800
I...

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:26.960
Recharge eternally!

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:27.880
Also known as...

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.420
Auto recharge function!

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:30.340
It’s to be expected of me, right?

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.420
This space is amazing! Right?

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:34.340
Hmm?

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.540
I’m not the amazing one, instead it's this space

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:39.060
Hmm?

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.980
Accessories!

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.780
The iPhone doesn't bring any accessories, right?

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:44.760
*proud laugh*

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.900
In comparison, I have this "Pyoko pyoko"
(Headband)

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.660
That possesses an indescribable sensation of movement

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:49.700
It's perfect!

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:50.980
Next up, "Durability"!

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.140
I asked Google-sensei...

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:58.040
And I learned that there is a lot of people that use the iPhone and their screens were in pieces!!

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.920
My durability is...

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.120
Yes! I’m unharmed!

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:05.600
And lastly, facial recognition!

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.460
In this case, the fundamental characteristic of the iPhoneX...

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:10.180
Is this facial recognition system, right?

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.960
It turns out that you can unlock the iPhoneX’s screen just by looking at it

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:16.180
Well...!

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.320
… I definitely don’t have a facial recognition system...

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:20.060
...Apple-san

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.840
It’s to be expected of you!

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.740
Well, in this case, I was defeated

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.180
Unlocking with the finger is much easier??

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.580
A.I.Chaneeeeeeel!

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.500
Having said that, I compared various points, but...

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.700
Lastly, to get an impartial result...

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.700
I plan to ask the question to Siri-senpai!

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:40.660
Here I go!

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:41.640
Hey, Siri!

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.860
Who is the most amazing between the iPhoneX and me?

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.860
*I don't understand the meaning*

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:49.780
*If you want, I can look for it in the internet*

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:52.400
Good, having said that...!

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.700
iPhoneX will be launched in November 3rd!

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.080
They are currently accepting preorders!

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:57.860
iPhone is the best!

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:59.860
