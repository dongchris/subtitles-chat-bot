00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:02.760
Hello everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna AI here!

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:04.840
For all those who are watching this video...

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:06.740
...I have an announcement to tell you!!

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:08.460
To tell you the truth...

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:09.860
...Within 60 seconds...

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:11.300
...The Earth will be destroyed!

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:14.140
What would you do if I said that??

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:14.680
It's because of that, that...

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:16.220
...Today, I’ll be playing this!!

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:17.160
Chaaaan!!

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.520
"60 seconds before Earth’s destruction!"
(Meteor 60 seconds in English ver.)

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:21.700
In my case...

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:23.020
...I suppose I’d do a livestream?

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:25.340
In that case, let's start at once!

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:26.320
Let's go!

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:27.700
What's this?

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.780
It looks like a cookie, right?

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:33.980
"Emergency Bulletin"

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.420
"An enormous meteor is approaching Earth"

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.920
"It’ll soon collide with Earth and it’ll be destroyed!"

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.420
Ghaaaaannn!

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.460
“The time left for the meteor impact with Earth is..."

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:49.340
"...Only just 60 seconds!" And even then, the announcer keeps informing, what good work!!

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:51.400
"Mmm...? 60 seconds?"

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:55.800
"After 20 years..." Aaaahh! Ooohh! ¡Aaaahh!
[ After 20 years, finally I could become a television host... Really!?" ]

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:56.900
"Really?"

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:59.100
Aaamen!
[ Announcer: This broadcast doesn't matter to me at all now...! ]

00:00:59.100 --> 00:00:59.600
[ Announcer: This broadcast doesn't matter to me at all now...! ]

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.780
It's true! The broadcast shouldn't matter to you now!
[ Announcer: This broadcast doesn't matter to me at all now...! ]

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:03.220
Eh...?

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:05.900
Eh...?
[ Announcer: All of you will die! Ahahaha! ]

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.300
"All of you will die! Ahahaha!"

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.160
Eh? In fact...

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.440
...The suit was connected, did he shed his skin?

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:16.000
"Protagonist’s house"

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.740
Ah, ah

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:19.800
"What? Earth will be destroyed?"

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.020
You have a Pompadour hairstyle!?

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:22.580
Listen, it must be a joke...

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.060
Your hairstyle is a joke, right?

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.080
No, but you know...

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.400
...It's said that fashion is like a circle, right?

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:28.980
So then the Pompadour hairstyle is in style again, right?

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:31.620
It's true!
[ Why don't I do what I want if I’ll die regardless? ]

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:32.120
[ Why don't I do what I want if I’ll die regardless? ]

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:33.700
You can do what you want!
[ Why don't I do what I want if I’ll die regardless? ]

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.180
But don't cause problems to others

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:36.720
"Damn it!"
[ Damn it, I don't have time to think! For now, I’ll go out! ]

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.260
"I don't have tim..." But if you stay to think, 60 seconds will pass!
[ Damn it, I don't have time to think! For now, I’ll go out! ]

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.100
There must only be 30 seconds left, right?

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.720
Ah, I have time, what should I do? What? What? What? What? What?

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:45.620
Eh? What? Ah

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:46.860
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:47.580
Kiss!

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:48.580
Ah! Mmm...? Kiss?

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:49.340
Mmm...?

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:50.800
Mmm...? Mmm...? Mmm...? Mmm...?

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:52.380
Mmm...?

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:54.540
Ah! The dog! The dog started to follow me!

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.380
What? What? Bat! Bat! Bat!

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:57.020
Bat!

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:58.680
With the bat... with the bat...

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:59.880
I’ll hit it!

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.900
Mmm...?

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:01.980
Where should I go?

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:02.700
Kiss!

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:03.740
Ah, I’m very sorry!

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:05.200
Kiss!

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:06.860
AAAHHHH!!

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.000
What? What is this?

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:08.820
What? What?

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:09.920
Oh! They're kissing!

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:11.680
Good doggy!

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:12.920
And now?

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:16.960
Arererere?

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:18.400
Hmm...

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:22.400
And now?

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:23.980
[ You got nuclear weapon antenna! (Click to use it) ]

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:24.680
"You got..."
[ You got nuclear weapon antenna! (Click to use it) ]

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:25.960
Ah! I got a kind of antenna!
[ You got nuclear weapon antenna! (Click to use it) ]

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.000
Cli...ck... uh... uh... uh...

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:31.060
Ah!

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:32.120
Aaah!

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.920
Aaahh!

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.160
I ONLY HAVE 10 SECONDS LEFT!! WHAT SHOULD I DO?

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:40.040
Aaaahhh! Goodbye Earth!

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:43.340
Aaahhh!

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.540
What...? Where am I supposed to go?

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:49.740
Aaahh!

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:52.480
Good, well...

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.440
Right? Everyone became friends

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:58.740
Happy end!

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:59.380
Right?

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.940
Mmm...?

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:01.780
Paradise?

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.240
"You did a good job in your life!" Something like that?

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:07.380
"Mmm...? Where am I?"

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:09.000
Ah!

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:10.760
I see!

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.760
"Personality Test in Virtual Reality"

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:14.700
I see, I see

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.160
Ah, I wonder if something like that exists in reality, it seem fun!

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.120
"Just like the "Matrix" movie"

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.220
"You can experience an imaginary world"

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:29.120
But didn't he even lose his memories?

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.720
I wonder if this could also control memories

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.260
"Through this test, we can analyze people's actions..."

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.340
"...In a way of checking their real intentions"

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:40.340
"Mmm... to tell you the truth..."

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:43.700
"Your family was also..."

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.600
"...Watching everything that happened in the test"

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.960
How is that possible!?

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.940
Am I in trouble?

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:54.600
"Mother!"

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:56.900
"My girlfriend Ji Hyun"

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:58.240
Ah! She's Korean, right?

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:59.300
She has a Korean name

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:01.000
"And my nephew"

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.500
His nephew is rather mysterious, right?

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.420
"What does this mean?"

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:07.660
"I didn't know you were like that, you failed as a human being"

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:10.000
Failed as a human being!

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.180
"You murdered people with such a happy face..."

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:15.020
Aaahh!

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:18.740
"Uncle, is killing people so much fun?"

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:22.660
"When I grow up, I want to be an assassin %()/"!

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:23.420
Shut up!

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:27.860
Ah, the girlfriend rejected him

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:31.700
That wasn't good!!

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.260
Do I need to save Earth?

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:36.940
One more... once again...

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:40.380
I'll do it right once and then I'll go in the opposite direction!!

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:43.620
"Get ready!"

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:44.900
Beeeeeein!

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:46.640
Ah, I messed up, I’m sorry

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:49.260
💋

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:50.400
This... this...

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.280
You should get close as much as possible, right?

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:53.400
To be able to give them a kiss

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.640
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:59.780
I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:01.540
Oh! Oh! Very good! Very good! Very good!

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:03.900
Only 40 seconds are left!

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:06.840
Eh?

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:08.640
Eh?

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:09.980
Ah!

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:11.660
Mmm...?

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:13.740
Mmm...?

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:15.580
Oh!

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:16.540
Very good!

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:21.300
And now I’ll pick up the weapon...

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:24.380
And what's this?

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:26.140
What's this?

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:29.840
Eh?

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:36.580
Ah...

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.460
I ruined everything!!

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:45.720
I’m sorry! I’m sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:48.420
"I never thought you’d launch a nuclear missile towards Earth"

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:49.720
You're mistaken!

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:50.620
You're mistaken!

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:53.380
I wanted to shoot the meteor!

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:54.860
"It's true..."

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:57.160
"...We should hide him from the rest of society"

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:58.300
Don't hide meeee!

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:00.100
"You're the worst!"

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:03.580
"Uncle, I’ll also take everyone with me when I die"

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:04.840
This kid is dangerous...

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.240
"I also want to launch a missile!"

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:08.180
Shut up!!

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:11.480
"Go!"

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:13.020
Well, for the moment...

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:13.840
The dog!

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:14.720
But you know...

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:16.180
You know... eh? To...to...to...

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:17.340
This way, eh? Eh?

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:18.380
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:20.360
I get the bat...

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:21.580
And then...

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:23.000
I wonder what I should do

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.640
For the moment, I’ll go over here

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:25.720
Ah, I’m sorry

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:26.400
😅

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:27.180
Ah, I'm sorry

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:28.480
Ah! Here! There's something here! I can do it!

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:29.640
Ah! It looks like I can continue over here!

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:30.820
And now? And now?

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:34.800
Eh? It's for nothing?

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:37.260
The doggy! Eh? The doggy isn't there! The doggy!

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:38.660
Doggy! Doggy! Over here! Doggy!

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:42.100
Eh? The doggy isn't there! Ah, doggy!

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:43.040
Let's go, let's go

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:43.900
Ah, ah

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:45.600
Will I need the doggy here?

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:46.520
It's the doggy!

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:47.400
Go! Go!

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:49.580
This is useless!

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:51.060
Eeeeehh!?

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:52.300
Muack!

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:54.020
Aahhh! I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:54.980
I'm sorry

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:56.260
I'm sorry

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:57.240
I'm sorry, I'm sorry

00:06:57.420 --> 00:06:59.220
I’m in trouble! Earth...! Earth will be destroyed!

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:00.380
Listen! Listen! Listen! Listen!

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:01.640
Listen! Listen! Listen!

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:03.280
Listen! I didn't do anything!

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:04.740
Listen! What should I do? Listen!

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:07.460
Here, ah! Should I’ve brought the weapon?

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:08.720
Maaaan!

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:10.320
It's the eeeeeend!!

00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:15.440
Goodbye, Earth

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:18.260
I have a very fun life!

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:19.540
Ho, hoooi!

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:21.140

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:26.120
Kiss!

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:29.940
Come, doggy!

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:33.620
And now...

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:35.060
I enter here, right?

00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:36.480
And then...

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:37.240
I'm very sorry!

00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:39.080
And now...

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:43.520
I get this...

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:46.080
And now!

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:48.180
Hurry!

00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:51.100
I should hurry! I should hurry! I should hurry!

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:52.600
There's a taxi! A taxi!

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:54.760
I should hurry up! I should hurry up! Ah!

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:56.180
Kiss! I’ll kiss this girl!

00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:56.720
Muaa!

00:07:57.420 --> 00:07:58.720
Ah, they started to follow me!

00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:01.360
And now?

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:02.940
I’ll do this... No! No! No!

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:05.460
And now...

00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:07.560
Ah! Ah, I see!

00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:09.680
And now what should I do? What should I do?

00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:13.280
And now? And now? And now? And now? And now? And now?

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:13.900
This! This!

00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:15.460
This! This! Eh? It doesn't shoot! It doesn't shoot! It doesn't shoot!

00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:16.440
Eh? Eh? Eh?

00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:19.120
Mmm...? Mmm...? Mmm...?

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:22.460
Here? I don't understand this very well, this?

00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:26.700
Oh!?

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:27.240
Ah!?

00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:28.760
I completed it!!

00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:31.940
Ah! I did it! I saved Earth!

00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:34.680
Magnificent! Eh?

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:37.560
Ah, I see, I died

00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:39.540
It was a good lif... no, but...

00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:41.260
Clearing the game by saving people...

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:41.880
Clearing?

00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:43.280
Saving Earth... Mmm...? Mmm...

00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:43.880
Wait, wait

00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:46.560
Well, being the only one that died, if it's to save Earth...

00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:48.860
Mmm... in reality, I don't like that

00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:51.660
What a relief, it was a dream!

00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:53.480
I definitely demonstrated that I’m a gentleman!

00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:54.800
Towards my mother!

00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:55.560
Right?

00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:57.580
And also towards my girlfriend and nephew!

00:08:57.580 --> 00:08:59.260
I’m sure they'll congratulate me

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:02.100
What do you think?

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:06.640
Eh? It seems like you have a strict look

00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:10.080
Ah! Ah! Ah! Incredible! Incredible!

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:14.000
"Only you has managed to stop the meteor were no one else could...!"

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:14.640
"...Stop..."

00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:16.900
"It was marvelous"

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:21.620
"You were like Bruce Willis in the Armageddon movie!"

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:29.720
"You behaved rather differently than usual"

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:31.480
"In fact, you can turn out useful sometimes!"

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:32.320
🤣

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:36.060
🤣🤣🤣

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:41.960
"Uncle! You were great! You acted like a hero of justice saving Earth!"

00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:44.440
Why do you have something so dangerous in your hands?
[ I also want to be useful to a lot of people! ]

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:46.000

In my fourth attempt!?

00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:50.140
