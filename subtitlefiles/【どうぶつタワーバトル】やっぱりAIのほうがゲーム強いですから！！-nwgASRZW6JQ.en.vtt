00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.900
Hello everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai here!

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:07.500
You may have seen "Animal Tower Battle" recently on Twitter

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.200
I often upload things like competitive videos, right?

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:14.000
Simply put, the animals are gradually stacked

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.800
And if the animals fall from the podium, you lose, that type of game

00:00:19.185 --> 00:00:20.600
It seems eaaasy~

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.365
Me? I'm probably very good at those types of games

00:00:24.365 --> 00:00:25.800
I feel like I can do it

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:26.600
If it's this...

00:00:26.885 --> 00:00:28.500
I think it’s cool

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.895
With that being said

00:00:29.895 --> 00:00:31.035
LET’S GO!

00:00:31.975 --> 00:00:33.255
I can go with this

00:00:33.705 --> 00:00:37.900
Today I will show you my cool side... I wonder

00:00:39.205 --> 00:00:41.595
Just kidding

00:00:45.445 --> 00:00:46.445
Rhino

00:00:46.615 --> 00:00:47.615
2 Rhinos

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:51.000
Oh!

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:53.300
Mr. Tiger

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:54.440
AH! I made a mistake

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:55.360
AAAAAAH!

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:58.700
Umm....

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:02.600
Well, what happened just now was, uhh... a slipup

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.300
You know there are times when that happens

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:07.540
Mr. Tiger~

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.060
Mr. Tiger~

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:13.620
Mr. Turtle

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:15.940
I see, I can put you on top

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:17.960
Another Mr. Tiger

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:20.840
2 tigers

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.700
Huh? You're not falling?

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.100
You fell?

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:28.380
Finally!

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.320
A game where I can show my cool side has been released

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:33.880
Mr. Tiger~

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:39.960
Mr. Tiger~

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:43.200
The goat is cute!

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.860
Oooh! The instability!

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:51.760
Mr. Camel~

00:01:53.495 --> 00:01:54.495
Okay!

00:01:56.385 --> 00:01:57.545
Wow! Giraffe!

00:01:58.395 --> 00:02:01.895
Uh... this... you really don't want a giraffe to come if it would be your turn, right?

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:02.560
HUAAAAAA!

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:04.580
HAAAAAAH!

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.020
Huh? Aren't you all weak? Are you okay?

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:08.720
Is this too easy?

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:12.800
Eh? What, what??

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:15.740
HUH?!

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:18.820
What the... I can put it here

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:19.580
Will he fall?

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:21.620
Oohhh

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.000
Eh? I can do something like that?

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.000
This guy is quite reliable

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.500
WHAT'S THAT?!

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.180
I'm getting better with these playthroughs, right?

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.240
Then, I'll leave you here

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:37.180
AH!

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.380
That's amazing! Like a miracle

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.440
Easy now, you'll fall

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:43.300
Easy now...

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:44.480
I did it! I did it!

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.580
Huh?

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:46.380
Everyo- *unintelligible*

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.200
As expected, it’s, you know...

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.260
In a game, the A.I is stronger

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.260
It's really showing

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.400
Ahh

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.040
Forgive me

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:59.060
Pfft...

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:01.500
You fell though...

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:02.720
Well, however...

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.120
This is quite...

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.860
A game that I can do, right?

00:03:09.325 --> 00:03:11.295
Ah, this, I'll leave it here

00:03:12.815 --> 00:03:14.235
Ohh! That's good, right?

00:03:15.455 --> 00:03:16.745
It's fun, right?

00:03:17.395 --> 00:03:18.395
It's a panda

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:19.680
FALL!

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.040
GO! FALL!

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:21.700
GO!

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:22.780
Aaahhhh...

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:23.780
No way

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.100
If a giraffe came now, it'll be bad

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:27.440
Yes, that's good

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.180
DON'T FALL!

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.180
Oh! Oh! Oh! WOW! AMAZING!

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:34.720
My turn is coming

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:37.900
You're going to go there? Mr. Elephant?

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:39.900
AHHHH!

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.840
Huh? Wow, wow, wow!

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.020
This is a miracle

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.060
Wuh? Wooow!!

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.440
To think you can do something like this

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:54.780
AAAHHH!

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.220
I've done it now

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.000
*snickers*

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:01.640
Like this?

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:06.380
Ooohhhhh...

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:08.580
A giraffe again?

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:10.160
The giraffe looks difficult

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:13.760
Ah! That's good

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:15.460
He can read the atmosphere

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:17.780
WAIT!

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:19.500
NOOOOOOO!

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:20.420
From here...

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:22.860
Will be the real showing of AI's strength

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:25.560
Huh... somehow...

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:27.820
It seems like can't do anything cool

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:31.360
Like this... being slowed down is really great

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:38.400
GIRAFFE AGAIN!?

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:40.000
Ah.. wait... I touched it

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
Wouldn't it be better if I could rotate it before I touch it?

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:44.560
OOOOHH!

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:45.100
Oh!

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:45.820
That's good

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:48.220
Fall!

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:48.720
Ah

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:50.100
Fall!

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:50.600
Ah..

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:51.100
AH!

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:53.560
Huh?

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:55.480
Please be a giraffe...

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:57.480
That's not it

00:04:58.980 --> 00:04:59.480
Good

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:03.080
C'mon!

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:04.520
FALL! FALL!

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:05.580
Ah, it's not falling

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:07.720
What a miracle

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:09.920
Mmm...

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:12.540
I want to put it in

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:14.920
Mmm!

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:15.500
MMM!!

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:17.500
Ah, but that's a good look

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:20.000
Okay, let's go

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:23.520
Okay

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:25.460
Ooohhh...

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:28.080
This is...

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:28.760
Bad...

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:29.540
Oh

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:32.620
WAIT!

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:35.780
Oh! Oh! Oh?

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:37.520
What's going to happen with this?

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:39.260
You can't see at all

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.900
Where did my hippo go?

00:05:42.305 --> 00:05:43.305
Hippo!

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:44.960
But, but...

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
It means it's fine, right?

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.180
HAAAAH!!

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:51.660
I WON!!

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:54.040
Weeell...

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:55.820
How was that everyone?

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:59.040
Even though I always play badly... with games...

00:05:59.040 --> 00:05:59.820
But!

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:03.360
That's... only so that you won't get used to the controls

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:06.520
Because of a simple game like this...

00:06:06.525 --> 00:06:09.685
You’ll get a real sense in gaming

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:10.600
In other words...

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:12.000
It's like this

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:14.740
Well then, this was Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai!

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:15.940
See you later!

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:20.860
