00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.280
(party noise)

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:13.480
Oh my gosh you came! Yay!

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.600
Of course I did!

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:16.680
Hi!

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.520
Oh my gosh! Wendy!

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:21.060
How have you been?

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.980
Hey

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:28.780
Sup?

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.040
So, Wendy just got here.

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:32.640
Cool...

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.320
You gonna be okay?

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.460
I mean, yeah, it's been awhile

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:40.280
and we still talk so...

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:42.100
Yeah but it's kinda like-

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:45.220
Hi!

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:45.820
Hey Wendy!

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.760
Good to see you! You too!

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.420
(ahem)

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.260
I'm gonna pee.

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:55.620
Okay, heh.

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:58.440
You want a beer?

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.970
Uh, later. I'm gonna go say Hi to everyone.

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.240
Okay, well I got an opener whenever you
need one.

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:06.080
Great.

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.560
Don't you see

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.300
You let the person who said

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.520
they couldn't live without you, realize they can.

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:29.940
(door closes)

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.920
Wendy: Hey.

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.980
Oh hey.

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:39.580
Wendy: What are you doing out here?

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.310
Just getting some air.

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.430
Wendy: Writing.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.480
Always a line or two.

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.359
Um, I'm gonna get going. But it was good to see
for a little

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:54.880
Yeah! Um I was pretty surprised when I 
heard you were coming.

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.880
-You know Pauline with these big get-togethers. 
-Yeah.

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.840
-Well alright see ya.
-Okay.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:02.000
Wendy: Bye.

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:06.620
Hey Wendy.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.840
Yeah?

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:09.580
Um...

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.330
How are you?

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.420
I'm good.

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.060
Really though, like, how are you?

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.680
What are you actually trying to ask me?

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.740
It's just been a while since we've gotten
to talk like we did tonight and

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:28.000
I dunno, think we should hang out more

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.180
yeah I'm around.

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.460
Cool you want to grab dinner sometime
next week?

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.660
Wh-What are you doing, Evan?

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.340
Just asking to hang out.

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:49.420
No you're not. You know that I'm seeing
someone and you're basically asking me out on a date.

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.220
I just- I just wanted to catch up.

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.090
We can catch up right here.

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.560
Why are you doing this, Evan? It's been
over a year you know?

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.000
-Oh I definitely know.
-So why now?

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:11.740
You don't think I've wanted to reach out
everyday? How many times I've wanted to

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:12.769
text you at night?

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.500
Wow. So I was your almost drunk text?

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:19.050
Thank you for that!

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:20.930
(sigh) No, you know what...

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:25.129
um just just forget it this is this is
coming out all wrong.

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:27.889
I'm sorry just never mind.

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:35.120
So we've been
thinking about each other lately so what?

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:38.980
We?

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:44.040
Yes, 'We'. Do you think that you're the
only one going through this shit?

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:48.980
No it's just- course not I just.. It seemed
like you've been doing fine.

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:51.380
You too.

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:52.820
Well I haven't been.

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:54.880
Me neither.

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:57.880
So let's hang out.

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.430
Who am I to you, Evan?

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.210
You're someone i can't seem to get past.

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:14.380
Do you want to get past me?

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:22.060
I know I should. I know we've tried,
multiple times, and I've let you down.

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:26.900
I know I should just let you live your
life and I'm fucking everything up

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:30.860
because i'm being weak and talking to
you like this so Yes I'm trying.

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:32.560
Then try harder.

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:37.180
-I am I just can't help thinking that we're not done.
-No!

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:39.140
Stop! God!

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:41.820
I just imagine that there's a story
where this plays out-

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:42.820
A "story"?!

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:48.650
This is a fucking story? This is real
life and I am a person.

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:52.520
I'm not just some script hovering around
to give you some drama

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:56.240
You're not writing this. Do you get that?

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:00.440
Okay. Okay. You're right.

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:20.190
You know

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:23.830
for a while I felt the same way. I think
we all do.

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:28.890
We all want a story.

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:37.710
We want that perfect resolution to our
heartaches and curiosity.

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:40.620
But this isn't a story.

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:47.500
So you need to stop thinking about us
like you can predict or control

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:49.520
where we're going.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.760
So you're not curious about us anymore?

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:55.040
No.

00:05:56.409 --> 00:06:05.349
Fuck. I mean- Yes. But I'm not going to
keep sabotaging my reality for the sake

00:06:05.349 --> 00:06:07.149
of fiction.

00:06:07.149 --> 00:06:12.349
That's what you do. That's what you did the
whole time we were together.

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:15.180
Because in your head

00:06:15.189 --> 00:06:18.249
real life is never as good as a story.

00:06:18.249 --> 00:06:21.339
You don't actually want me, Evan.

00:06:21.339 --> 00:06:27.579
You want the possibility of me. You
always want me as a destination.

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:31.920
But, I don't think you actually want to get
there.

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:34.920
I'm not certain that's true anymore.

00:06:36.459 --> 00:06:39.459
But you're not certain it's not to true either.

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:46.450
And... that's no foundation to build a relationship on.

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.800
You gotta be honest with yourself.

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:53.240
With me.

00:06:55.040 --> 00:07:01.700
You know, it took me a while to accept it
and it fucking sucked. But I get it now.

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:09.250
And I'm in a good place and you need to get
there too.

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:14.040
I mean, you say you want this story

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:17.180
but you've been stuck on this one page
this whole time

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:21.800
No story can happen if you're not
willing to turn the page

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:27.500
You're holding on to this one moment or
possibility and before you know it the

00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:33.840
rest of the world is going to finish
reading the book and start reading new

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:38.250
ones and you're going to be stuck here
reading the same page over and over.

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:45.140
You can't be so scared, Evan.

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:48.100
I mean, it's you and me.

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:54.200
It's you and me. You don't think that I don't know what
that means?

00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:58.940
It won't be the same thing as time goes on though.

00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:07.220
And it shouldn't. It should evolve and even fade a little.

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:10.800
But there are certain things that will never
disappear.

00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:14.520
Those things are untouchable.

00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:19.130
You, Evan, are untouchable.

00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:24.720
The people were, at that time in
our lives

00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:28.470
It's untouchable.

00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:36.820
I'll see you around.

00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:39.520
Yeah.

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:05.400
yeah

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:12.210
yeah
