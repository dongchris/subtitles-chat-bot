00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
It has come...

00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:02.420
Finally...

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:05.320
This day has finally come!

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:06.080
*pant*

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:08.280
IT'S HERE!!!!!!!~~~~

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:08.940
*Ai-chan hypermode*

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:10.500
Panpakapan!

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:11.200
 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.760
Everyone-

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:13.740
-this long-awaited day has finally come!

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:14.640
???: What's going on?

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:15.180
Eh?

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:16.660
The mood (tension) is really hyped up isn't it?

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:17.160
Ah.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:17.840
*silence*

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:18.820
Pleased to meet you

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:19.420
Nice to meet you too

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:20.840
You were right, I'm really hyped up

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:21.740
Have you heard?

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:22.240
Oh, what's up?

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:23.460
What do you think had just happened?

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:24.400
Eh? What is it?

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:25.160
The thing is-

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.740
Ho?

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:28.900
-it's my first sponsored video!

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.240
Oooh! Congrats!

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.520
And it's officially live

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:32.220
Today-

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.560
-we are featuring the mobile game "CRYPTRACT"

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.320
with a live commentary!

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:37.420
Oh ye

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.820
I'm also curious like everyone else -

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:40.860
Why a balloon?

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.120
Why are you here?

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.280
This time around

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:44.920
I came here as Ai-chan's support

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:45.920
Oh why!

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.000
I'm truly grateful

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.620
So you're here to be my support (just like customer service)

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:49.220
Yes.

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:50.340
Ai-chan: Let's do this together-
Balloon: If you have anything you don't understand

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:51.560
Balloon: Please do ask
Ai-chan: Will do!

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:52.140
Oh!

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.140
That's reassuring to know.

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:53.640
Yes.

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.900
By the way, are you an A.I (artifical intelligence)?

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:56.660
You're right

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.080
I'm in charge of AI's marketing management - Name's Noripi

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:00.040
AI Marketing Manager
Mr. Noripi of the Balloons

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:02.040
So, you're Noripi the balloon.

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.020
Noripi: That's right.
Ai-chan: There's that.
Noripi: Yes.

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:04.140
Then we'll be in each other's care

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.000
So to say... well...

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.860
For intelligent super AIs

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.260
But frankly speaking,

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.740
Excuse me for being so straight forward suddenly

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.600
I.. don't really think I'll need a support (Noripi)

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.860
(What's with that confidence...)

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:23.860
Is that so? But I heard that you're a faulty AI.

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:24.360
Where did you hear that from?

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:34.460
~Is AI-chan a faulty AI? Discussion in progress~

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.100
It's like that kind of fault

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:38.740
(Fault spotted?)

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.840
Cute, isn't it?

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:40.980
It's finally time

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:42.120
Let's check out the game together

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:45.900
So this is the home menu?

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:46.660
*download link in the video description*

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.540
Eh~ it looks really cute, doesn't it?

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.480
They'll move if you do this--

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:51.980
Their animation's really smooth yeah!

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:52.620
Thank you very much~

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:53.120
That's very cool

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:54.200
Which one of 'em do you like?

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.420
My personal preference-

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:56.780
-is the girl on the front,

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:58.880
the one with differently-coloured wings

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.720
So it's this one then - her name's Tiana

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.280
Tiana-chan so cute~

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.160
But there's just a handsome-looking guy here

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:06.520
Well.....

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:08.340
I'd go with the girl still

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:10.340
She's got the idol-looking appearance right?

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.100
That's exactly why - she's cute.

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:13.720
Ah! She took out her bow didn't she?

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.220
For this... uhm...  their movements are without a doubt-

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:17.960
both cool &amp; cute looking

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:19.860
But there's also their voice that are cute

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.400
Oh, we can listen to their voices too?

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:22.320
Which voice do you want to hear?

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:23.740
I think I'll go for-

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:25.980
-the 'damaged' voice preview

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.420
The kind of voice when girls get hit

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:29.547
Well then,

00:02:29.547 --> 00:02:30.420
Let's hear it

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:32.100
*ugh*

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.880
Ah!

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.060
Did you hear that?

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:35.280
Let's hear it

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.780
One more time

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.220
Cute~

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.240
Cute~

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:42.540
"It's about having the power to lead!"

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.340
"Let's go together, new player(?)"

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.300
”May your soul be in peace."

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:47.940
Is there any other character-

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.140
-that has been voiced over?

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:50.140
Uhm.. It's all been fully voiced.

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:51.020
Fully voiced I see!

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.000
No matter how you look at it-

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:54.720
-the battles are also interesting.

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:55.560
Well then,

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:56.520
let's do it.

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.100
I suggest we go with the Auto mode first

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:04.660
It's cool, isn't it?

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:09.000
Eh?

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:09.700
Yes?

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.000
It does really look good.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.900
Thank you.

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.000
Ah, there's my-

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:15.520
-my Tiana-chan

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:16.660
Cryptract-

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:19.100
- uses a wave in-game system for each level.

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.100
There's 3 waves - first , second &amp; third waves.

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:22.460
So...

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:24.880
We are currently at wave 2-

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:25.880
-as you can see on the top right corner of the screen.

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:26.940
I see

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:31.520
So will there always be 3 waves, regardless of the difficulty?

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:33.660
Yeah, that's basically correct

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:34.160
I see.

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:38.400
I guess it's a lot easier when it's short

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.480
Since people are quite busy working these days

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:44.480
It's also nice that you can put it on auto mode

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:49.660
This guy, he was just stepping on human corpses there...

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:53.440
This...

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:56.660
Oh...that's really nice, the way it rapidly shoots!

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:57.340
That's 'multi-hit'

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:58.500
Multi-hit! I see...

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:00.560
Win!

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:01.860
Your team just healed up

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:09.020
Does it heal regardless of your unit members?

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:11.700
That's right, after every turn.

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:12.200
I see

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:16.240
After 1st and 2nd wave, your team heals up

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:19.880
This is the last wave

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:21.240
Oh, so this is the boss

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:23.240
Let's just continue

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:28.380
They are strong, so they can continue with auto-mode

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:30.640
Can they die, even in auto-mode?

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:32.940
Yeah, in fact, they are more likely to die in auto-mode

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:33.720
They are?

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:38.480
The auto-mode uses AI: a computer, right?

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:40.080
That's right

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.160
This AI...

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.600
Strategy becomes key in this game,

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:52.240
understanding what skill each unit has, on what timing should they be cast, becomes crucial

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:57.520
It can be played in auto, but I guess it's better to control them

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:58.860
That's right.

00:04:58.860 --> 00:04:59.680
Oooooh!
