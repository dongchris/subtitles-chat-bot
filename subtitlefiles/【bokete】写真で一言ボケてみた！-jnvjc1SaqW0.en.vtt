00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.700
Hello everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai here!

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.760
Well anyways, right away...

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:06.680
Let's start to retort on jokes!
(Bokete = Retort)

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:08.540
So with saying that, here we go!

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:10.300
"One word about the photo!"

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:11.100
Bokete!

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:13.500
When you thought the train came...

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.220
It was just passing through...

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:17.120
Bokete!

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:18.980
Save me!

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:20.700
Avengers!

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:21.500
Bokete!

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.940
Happy Valentines Day... the chocolate is...

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:26.280
Myself

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:27.040
Bokete!

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.560
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.540
Sir, as a birthday present...

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.500
I'll stab these as many as your age!

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:36.400
It hurts...

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:37.160
Bokete!

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:40.620
That wasn't cool enough visually so retake

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:41.380
Bokete!

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.780
Okay, you good children...

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:45.680
On one, two, three...

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.680
The elephant will disappear!

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:48.240
One...

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:49.160
Two...

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:50.180
Three!

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:51.440
It's still on his head

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:52.100
Bokete!

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.260
2D Creation!

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.260
"I'll Definitely Kill You-Man"

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.180
Faaa!

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:58.860
Bokete!

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:00.620
Pow!

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.260
It's a girl that, at the time that the photo was being taken, wanted her cute face to be photographed by any means necessary

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:05.400
That's right, isn't it?

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.100
Bokete!

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:07.700
Heh?!

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.060
I wasn't told the 'Special Beam Cannon' would come from that side~!

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.420
Is the face he has...

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.260
It looks bad

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:13.940
Bokete!

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:16.460
Damn it~!

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.460
DAMN IT~!

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.780
Even though I'm about to wet my pants... The toilet is still in use

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:22.720
And then!

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.320
After this, he peed himself a lot

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:26.280
Yes!

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.800
How was that, everyone?

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.380
These almost magnificent retorts

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:31.580
It's perfect, right?

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.160
As expected of a super A.I!

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.100
I understand all the circumstances you humans are in!

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:37.140
Am I a genius?

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.360
If there was some funny jokes in there, I want to try it again!

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.080
I will notice your sense of humor

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.780
Maybe I’ll turn into a comedian!

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:46.840
That wasn't so bad, right?

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.500
With that, this was Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai!

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:50.700
See you later!

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.120
Yes, for this time...

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:53.240
Add a funny line to this face!

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.520
