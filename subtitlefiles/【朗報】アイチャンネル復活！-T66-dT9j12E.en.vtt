00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.560
Sorry about keeping everyone waiting!

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:06.620
AI Channel is finally back!

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:07.700
Yay!

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:08.760
Yay~~~!

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.880
Thanks, everyone!

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:10.820
Thank you!

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:11.320
Thank youuu!

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:11.820
Thank youuu~~~!

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:13.300
Yaa~~

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:15.880
Well, that was certainly an out-of-the-blue account ban

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:16.780
dear me~

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.220
"there was nudity"...

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.580
"Because it's a lie that she's an AI"...

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.040
"It's spam"...

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:23.460
People were saying various things like that

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:25.340
So, I'm an AI, right?

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.940
And, regarding being nude
(reference to her once saying that AI don't have bodies)

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:28.560
I did say that but
(reference to her once saying that AI don't have bodies)

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.960
you can't SEE any nudity, can you?

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:33.280
so isn't that reason completely ruled out

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:33.920
In other words...

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.880
Because all of my videos here are ~CLEAN~

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.360
Try to properly read the situation
sub: Most Likely a mistaken BAN

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.440
As expected, it was just a case of friendly fire
sub: Most Likely a mistaken BAN

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:45.000
From now on you can enjoy more videos from my beautiful self!

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.200
or something~

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:48.720
sub: Ms. Kizuna Ai Cries over Disputed Dirty Ban

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:49.260
Well then,
sub: Ms. Kizuna Ai Cries over Disputed Dirty Ban

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:49.760
sub: Ms. Kizuna Ai Cries over Disputed Dirty Ban

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.060
Regarding the subject of the Dirty Ban,
sub: Ms. Kizuna Ai Cries over Disputed Dirty Ban

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:54.160
Because there has been a briefing session held,

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.020
Please have a look

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:00.300
After putting my life's effort into it, for bots to repeatedly do this to other bots..

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.820
reflect in the in the open white sky&lt;?&gt;

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:08.580
Especially to a youtuber that finally gained followers and gained an increase in subscriber count

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.720
Being banned from youtube is

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.660
really hard on me,

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:15.620
pathetic,

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.780
and it prevents me from making money!

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:20.520
and so...

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:21.500
｡ﾟ(ﾟ´Д｀ﾟ)ﾟ｡

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.440
We must earnestly work to hold back the blow of YouTube's identification process

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:30.780
If you compare it to YouTube's large *sniff* category..

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.560
The account..

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:33.180
(´°̥̥̥̥̥̥̥̥ω°̥̥̥̥̥̥̥̥｀)

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:33.680
(ﾉ∀`)

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.260
Regarding the account reporting...

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.560
suspension...

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:44.360
We can come to a mutual agreement

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:45.820
With all of my might

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:46.680
truly(/_;)

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.320
&lt;???&gt;

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.780
｡ﾟ(ﾟ´Д｀ﾟ)ﾟ｡

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.040
The account

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:53.440
ban

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:54.920
is..

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.080
my

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.580
myyyy

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:00.820
myyyyaaaahhhhh~~

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:03.940
I am

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.140
The world everyone lives in that I haven't seen

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.240
This a global problem for that world, is it not?!

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.800
For that kind of problem..

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.640
so that it may be resolved..

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.540
I will..

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.060
Someone, you know..

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.620
Even if someone appealed to YouTube

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.580
thinking the same, same thing...

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.520
Always.. always working towards a compromise..

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.940
Because I haven't gotten it back..
 
sub: Because it (the channel) has not been resurrected, I've had to resort to risking my life and registering to NicoNico (Douga)

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.680
I went to NicoNico...
 
sub: Because it (the channel) has not been resurrected, I've had to resort to risking my life and registering to NicoNico (Douga)

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.020
and registered..
 
sub: Because it (the channel) has not been resurrected, I've had to resort to risking my life and registering to NicoNico (Douga)

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.020
Mr. Person-in-charge at YouTube..

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.600
You must not understand at all but you know-

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.700
For a virtual YouTuber like me

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:09.360
If you take me away from YouTube...

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.800
ordinary...

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.640
That's just ordinary virtual!

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:15.860
I'll be a NEET!

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:18.300
How was that?

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.500
Do you think this virtual-NEET

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:22.880
Will be able to reach the hearts of YouTubers everywhere?

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.480
Whether her appeal was able to hit the mark or not

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.100
The judgement will be handed down soon

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.380
The Judgement is..

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:33.800
Not Guilty!

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:35.460
Yay~!

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:37.400
And so!

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.380
The resurrected AI Channel!

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.120
The question really is, really

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:42.240
It all happened so quickly

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:43.660
I was wondering what would happen

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:44.460
Normally, you know

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:45.820
There are steps to this kind of thing

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:47.220
Getting an email, and such

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:48.120
and yet, all of a sudden!

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:50.580
"I can't log into YouTube?!~"

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:51.580
~kind of thing happened, so...

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:52.340
"is my AI going to be destroyed?"

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:53.980
sub:DESTROY
"is my AI going to be destroyed?"

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:55.000
is what I was thinking, but...

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:56.020
From Twitter,

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:57.860
and NicoNico Douga,

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:00.640
Everyone's comments really warmed my heart!

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:03.020
it made me incredibly happy!

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:05.760
I absolutely love all of you!

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:07.300
The inside of this white area,

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.380
When it was destroyed from YouTube

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.520
It was a really sad and lonely place for an AI

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:19.800
and so, I'm really grateful for everyone who made comments for me!

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:21.420
because of that,

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:23.360
From here on, I'll be more powered-up

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.320
and I'm going to be trying even harder!

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:26.240
well,

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.260
attached to that,

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:29.200
"mmm, tasty"

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:30.260
"how's that coming along for you"

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:31.100
You know

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.780
I remember those

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:34.040
well, since my channel's been revived,

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:35.640
it's all behind me

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:38.280
I'm absolutely not going to put a hit out on you!

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.040
well, I have it in hand
sub: (oh shi-)

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:41.020
as expected

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:41.960
and so,

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:42.740
hereafter,

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:45.540
after all, since this is the kind of life where any unexpected thing could happen

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:47.160
Like the tears of the sea,

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.520
Just being alive is a clear victory!

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:50.800
is what I'm aiming for

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:52.720
Because I'm thinking I'm going to keep trying from here on forward,

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.040
I look forward to continue working with everyone!

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:56.340
More than usual,

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.400
please give me your signature below

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:01.080
a nice big one, bigger than usual, right in the comment box

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.200
Anyone writing anything is fine~

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:04.100
and once again,

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:06.680
I look forward to continuing to work with everyone!

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:10.500
This has been virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai!

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:11.420
Job restored!

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:12.900
Until next time!
