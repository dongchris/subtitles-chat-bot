00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:06.740
(laughter)

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:12.240
So... good birthday?

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.400
Mm, considering it was over a month late

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:18.900
Okay well, well, when we met

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:19.600
it had just passed

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:22.960
If you think about it, I'm 11 months early

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.120
I know I'm kidding

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.700
It was a really nice surprise

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:30.900
So was meeting you

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:34.600
You're welcome

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:36.400
(laughter)

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:37.980
(laughter)

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:49.680
(typing)

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.400
Hey, I think I need some air

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:01.720
Wanna take a break with me?

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.220
We can go get some ice cream

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:05.600
You know I can't right now, Janice

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.480
So, for my birthday next week

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.200
Do you think I should do a big party or

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.600
just something small with close friends?

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:18.900
Whatever you want

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:20.820
Doesn't matter to me

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.000
I want it to matter to you

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.160
(sigh) Okay, sorry

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.420
What's going on?

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:32.080
Nothing.

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:33.860
Don't... do that.

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:35.980
Something's obviously on your mind.

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:37.800
It's hard for me to explain.

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.340
Well, can you try?

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.000
Otherwise it's just gonna build up inside you and I'm gonna be in more trouble for it later

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.920
Um...

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.420
You like working with charts and graphs, right?

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.580
Sure

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:58.100
Imagine....

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.780
A graph

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:00.980
One axis

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:04.340
is our emotional investment in each other

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:07.040
The other axis

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:08.300
is time.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.400
I want to tell you a story

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.360
A story

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:15.740
about two hearts

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.080
that started in very different places

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.600
and the day they switched spots.

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.120
Do you remember when we first met?

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:28.920
Of course I do.

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.920
(Skype call sounds)

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:36.860
Hi!

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.120
Can you hear me?

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:39.520
Yup, this is Sean.

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.620
Uhh, I think we're still waiting on Jeff and Linda from marketing.

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.600
Hi Sean

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:44.840
Analytics, right?

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.880
Yeah

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:47.460
I'm Janice from the product team.

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:48.580
Nice to meet you.

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.580
You too.

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:51.600
Not how we met, but

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.440
how you felt when we did.

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:57.400
Hey, sorry we're late

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:58.220
Yeah, thanks for waiting.

00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:59.580
Hey guys! It's okay,

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:02.220
Janice was uh just correcting all my data.

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:04.240
Alright, so

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:05.880
It's been looking good...

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.300
Even though it was through a webcam

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:09.000
I could still see the shine in your eyes

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.000
That's how enamored you were.

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.500
I'll never forget how hard you tried

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.860
to keep that boring conference call going.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.600
Is that my line way up there?

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:24.100
Yeah

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:25.600
You were sprung

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.000
I guess I was pretty excited to have met you

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.480
But, you weren't having any of it

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:31.300
(chuckles)

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.800
Yeah

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.840
And I'm sorry for being so standoffish

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:40.240
I did think you were cute

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:41.340
But I kept my distance

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:45.460
Safe to say

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.200
my line started very low

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:49.040
You were doubtful of yourself.

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.180
and of falling in love.

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.280
There were so many times in my past that,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.900
I had thought I had found something real.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.800
From

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:04.780
high school puppy love

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:05.400
to

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:07.280
college boyfriends

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:09.080
and

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:12.500
each time they ended

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:14.900
I felt so stupid

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.300
Why did I allow myself to fall?

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:23.000
Why did I let my walls down?

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.000
So I built them higher

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:29.700
To protect myself from

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:31.540
people trying to make me believe again

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.340
But then you came along

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:37.900
You came along with your smile

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:40.000
your strong hands

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:41.900
your

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:45.800
funny hashtags and perfect use of emojis

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:49.680
You came along with confidence

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:50.700
not just in yourself

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:52.000
but in our potential

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:57.800
I felt emotions stirring but

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:59.500
I kept them down

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.160
I told myself not to get attached

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.980
Convincing myself I wasn't that interested

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.040
But instead of getting discouraged

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:14.080
you could tell that I was just afraid

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:17.500
So you sent messages to make me smile

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:21.080
You listened

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:22.500
to difficult answers

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:27.300
You let your arm graze mine and

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:28.900
brushed my hair to the side

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:32.000
You really believed that after

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.600
all the failed relationships in each of our past

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:38.040
that this is what it was all for

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:40.700
Then one day

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:43.600
You made me believe, too

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:48.440
(music)

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:52.260
With every night spent in your arms

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:55.200
with every time I called you boyfriend

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:00.000
my emotions grew and my dependence on you deepened

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:03.300
And for some time

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.700
I enjoyed this rise in my line

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:09.000
We both did

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:38.900
(music)

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:42.060
But something happened after a while

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:44.300
something...

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:47.220
I saw in all my past relationships

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:49.020
and so many around me

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:52.440
As my line continued to rise

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:55.000
your line began to fall

00:06:57.580 --> 00:06:59.260
And despite sensing this

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:02.100
I kept holding on to the hope that it was temporary

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:04.660
and it would eventually level out

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:08.680
And the sad thing is

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:10.200
the more I saw it fall

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:11.480
the deeper I fell

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:16.260
I became afraid of losing you

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:20.320
But Sean, I have been here before

00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:21.820
and I know where this goes

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:25.040
If our lines continue to go this way

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:26.460
then they will eventually cross

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.040
And pretty soon

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:32.320
the guy who

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:35.240
looked forward to conference calls with me

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:37.080
will find excuses to hang up

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:41.040
And the girl who avoided you for weeks

00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:44.620
will end up crying over losing you

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:47.700
I'll toil over how someone

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:49.900
who was so anxious to be with me

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:52.320
could become so indifferent

00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:56.200
Where do those emotions go?

00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:59.240
What happens to that wonder?

00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:03.000
Why does interest inevitably diminish

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.500
after the start of a relationship?

00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:09.160
You got me.

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:12.880
Is that all you wanted?

00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:17.200
Did you not want to keep me?

00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:24.920
This is where are now, Sean

00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:26.500
Right here

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:29.000
I still believe in you

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:31.400
and that we don't have to end up that way

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.160
But this is where we are right now

00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:39.800
I need to know

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:42.740
which way are you going?

00:08:46.800 --> 00:09:04.800
(music)
