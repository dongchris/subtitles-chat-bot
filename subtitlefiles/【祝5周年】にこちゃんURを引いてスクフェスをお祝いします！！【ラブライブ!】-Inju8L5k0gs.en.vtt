00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:02.703
Hello everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna AI here!

00:00:02.703 --> 00:00:03.203
Everyone!

00:00:03.203 --> 00:00:04.004
Let’s celebrate

00:00:04.004 --> 00:00:05.570
Love Live School Idol Festival’s

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:07.941
5th Anniversary!

00:00:07.941 --> 00:00:08.520
Now...

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:10.043
when you imagine their 5th Anniversary...

00:00:10.043 --> 00:00:10.570
what do you all

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:11.030
think they would do...

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:12.846
to celebrate?

00:00:12.846 --> 00:00:13.514
That’s right!

00:00:13.514 --> 00:00:14.460
“Choose a member!

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.750
Limited Box Scouting”!

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:17.851
I’m gonna do it, right?

00:00:17.851 --> 00:00:19.086
On top of that...!

00:00:19.086 --> 00:00:20.654
On top of that!

00:00:20.654 --> 00:00:21.750
“Bokutachi wa Hitotsu no Hikari”!
(We Are A Single Light)

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.023
The set for this

00:00:23.023 --> 00:00:24.380
is now out

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.193
for a limited time!

00:00:26.193 --> 00:00:27.630
Please watch the following!

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:29.430
There are two choices here!

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:32.399
There’s the “Choose your member! Limited Box Scouting”

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:33.640
and on top of this

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.470
there’s the “5th Anniversary Limited Box Scouting”!

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:37.260
The truth is...

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.530
before this video...

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:39.606
I already did my scouting with the “Choose a member” box

00:00:39.606 --> 00:00:41.375
And with what results!?

00:00:41.375 --> 00:00:42.830
With 33 tries...

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:44.878
being three tries of the 11 Scouts...

00:00:44.878 --> 00:00:46.046
2 URs

00:00:46.046 --> 00:00:48.749
were what I got! Congrats, me!!

00:00:48.749 --> 00:00:49.783
However!

00:00:49.783 --> 00:00:51.510
However, there’s a however to this!

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:52.200
This-

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.080
The members of the “Bokutachi wa Hitotsu no Hikari” box

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:55.180
are randomly drawn

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.870
from the third years!

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.995
Not just Nico-chan! Though Nico-chan’s friends are super cute, my best girl is Nico-chan

00:01:01.995 --> 00:01:03.430
and I didn’t pull her!!

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:04.440
So due to that...

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.300
I thought, “I’ve gotta keep going on until I win~”

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:06.990
and so

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:07.768
since I’ve come this far...

00:01:07.768 --> 00:01:08.770
I thought I’d leave

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:09.830
this box for the video

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:11.050
This time, I’ll definitely

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.872
be able to do it

00:01:11.872 --> 00:01:12.573
I’ll keep going until

00:01:12.573 --> 00:01:13.720
I have scouted eight times!

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:15.976
And by the halfway point

00:01:15.976 --> 00:01:17.711
I’ll show you all

00:01:17.711 --> 00:01:18.679
and get two URs!

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:20.781
Now then, let’s get started!

00:01:20.781 --> 00:01:22.482
A.I.Channel

00:01:22.482 --> 00:01:24.460
I can do this, I might even get one in the first try!

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:27.600
Nico Nico Ni~

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.530
Ah, that Elichika card was so cute!

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.500
A Nico-ni...

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.640
SR...

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.870
A Nico-ni...

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:46.030
SR…?

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:47.010
Hm?

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:48.730
What!?

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:49.490
What, what?

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.800
Ah!

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:50.800
But, but!

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:51.480
Hmm?

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:52.920
Isn’t this Non-tan (Nozomi) card

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:54.140
that one card?

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:55.090
Ah, maybe I’m wrong...

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.360
The one that turns into Rapunzel...

00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:58.752
Ah

00:01:58.752 --> 00:01:59.620
I’m wrong

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:00.630
Alright, let’s cheer up!

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:01.640
It’s a whole new scout!

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:02.522
I can do this!

00:02:02.522 --> 00:02:03.657
I won’t explode and die!

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:05.220
I won’t explode and die!

00:02:06.226 --> 00:02:07.294
MMMM!?

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.730
I haven’t even gotten a Nico-ni SR...

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.880
Huh?

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:16.330
Ah, but!

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:18.700
Ah, so cute!

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.650
But-but I haven’t gotten Nico-ni at all…!

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:21.870
But- well, well, well!

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.470
I’m still waiting for Nico-chan’s card from her birthday set!

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:26.670
That’s right...

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:27.740
I’m aiming for it!

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:28.782
That UR!

00:02:28.782 --> 00:02:29.282
Alright!

00:02:31.351 --> 00:02:33.286
I can still be calm about this

00:02:33.286 --> 00:02:34.054
AHHN!?

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:37.420
Hm?

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.480
This is the third time...

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.620
No...

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.380
I need to stay under control, under control

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.990
I’m sure

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:46.120
it’d be strange

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.990
if these

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.770
two URs

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:48.620
popped out

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.020
in just three scouts

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.800
since they normally

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:51.380
do not

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.938
Alright

00:02:51.938 --> 00:02:53.180
One, two, three!

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.560
Nico-chan is so cute!

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.110
Nico-chan is so cute!

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:56.480
Go, go, go, go, go!!

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:58.430
AHH!!

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:59.980
Ah! Ah! That’s not it!

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:00.450
Ah, but

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:01.980
it might be an

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:02.910
SSR Nico-ni

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:03.960
It might be Nico-ni?

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:07.370
Nico-chan hasn’t appeared at all

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:09.120
So strange!

00:03:11.692 --> 00:03:12.325
Ahh!

00:03:12.893 --> 00:03:14.227
I have so many of those cards!

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.190
I have so many of those

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.198
Thank you, but I have so many of them!!

00:03:18.198 --> 00:03:19.250
I can still do this

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.810
It’ll be fine

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:20.420
I can do this

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:21.802
I can, I can, I can!

00:03:21.802 --> 00:03:23.870
I’m under control, under control!

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:25.205
AHHHN!?

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:28.070
...What?

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:29.320
Huh?

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:32.310
Where’s my Nico-ni SR?

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:34.940
You know...

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:38.110
I’m really happy with all the other members of μ's

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:42.680
but is just one Nico-ni card too much to ask?

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:43.156
Huh?

00:03:43.156 --> 00:03:44.330
This is getting bad!

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:45.759
There’s only three turns left, right?

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:46.610
I’ll be able to turn it around

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:48.990
Nico-chan loves me, so I’ll do it for sure!

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:50.420
Yeah

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.980
I can do this!

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:53.530
Nico-chan is so cute, Nico-chan is so cute!

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:55.170
OOOOHH!!

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.940
Wait, but!

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:56.580
Um…!

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:57.671
Co-?

00:03:57.671 --> 00:03:58.371
AHHHH!

00:03:58.371 --> 00:03:58.972
So cute!

00:03:58.972 --> 00:03:59.539
No-!

00:03:59.539 --> 00:04:00.220
She’s cute

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:01.200
She’s cute, but!

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:01.790
She’s cute, but

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:02.600
I’m going insane, I’m going insane

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:03.220
Ah

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:04.420
Nico-ni, Nico-Nico

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:05.760
Ah...
I’m going- I’m going mad

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:06.690
I’m going mad, I’m going mad-

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:08.381
Haha! *inhales*

00:04:08.381 --> 00:04:09.282
I really seem insane!

00:04:09.282 --> 00:04:10.110
I’m going mad!

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:11.010
I’m going insane!

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:12.090
I’m going insane and it’s not good!

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:12.630
Not good!

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:13.754
Not good at all~!

00:04:13.754 --> 00:04:14.130
I can do this!

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:14.850
Two more tries!

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:15.255
I can do it!

00:04:15.255 --> 00:04:15.680
Please!

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:16.930
Please, please, please!

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:19.920
Ahh!

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:20.300
I’m actually going to go insane!

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:21.261
I’m actually going to go insane!!

00:04:21.261 --> 00:04:22.629
[ She’s already insane ]

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:24.730
I’m going insane

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:25.860
for a UR

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:26.830
I’m going insane

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:27.690
for a UR

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:28.980
UR

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:29.810
Nico-ni

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:31.020
Nico-ni~

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:32.330
Nico-ni

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:33.360
What?

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:34.960
What??

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:36.090
Ah? Huh?

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:36.560
Ah!

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:36.920
I see

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:37.930
I see!

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:39.460
This is just…

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:40.350
I get it now!

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:42.470
You can get all of them as just normal Rs...

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:42.949
Wow...

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:43.680
I see...

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:44.540
I see, so with this...

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:45.690
You aren’t...

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:48.480
You aren’t guaranteed an SR when you do an 11 Scout

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:49.689
Wow...

00:04:49.689 --> 00:04:51.091
I’m hyperventilating...

00:04:52.292 --> 00:04:53.160
One more time

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:53.570
Y’know-

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:54.100
I get it-

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:54.850
This is so bad

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:56.060
This is so bad, c’mon

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:56.710
Wait a second-

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:57.597
Just wait a second-

00:04:57.964 --> 00:04:59.566
AHHH, I LOVE YOU, NICO-NIN!

00:04:59.566 --> 00:05:00.370
You’re so cute!

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:01.070
You’re so cute!!

00:05:01.568 --> 00:05:02.903
Nico-nin is the best idol!

00:05:02.903 --> 00:05:04.137
AHHHHHH!!

00:05:05.672 --> 00:05:07.374
BUT I DON'T #&amp;$%*¥!!

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:09.830
Hahh…!

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:12.570
AAHHH!

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:14.160
Hold on!

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:15.690
I don’t understand!

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:17.320
If she doesn’t come now...

00:05:17.851 --> 00:05:19.519
If she doesn’t come now, then I’m gonna go insane!

00:05:19.519 --> 00:05:21.154
Ah! She came but…!

00:05:21.154 --> 00:05:22.322
AHHH!!

00:05:22.322 --> 00:05:23.023
Oh my...

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:30.990

Now I'm half way through

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:06.140
It’s probably since Nico-ni is a tsundere!

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:07.400
Since she’s such a tsundere!

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:09.290
