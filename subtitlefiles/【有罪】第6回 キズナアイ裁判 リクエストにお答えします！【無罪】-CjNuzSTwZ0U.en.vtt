00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.237
Hello everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna AI here!

00:00:03.237 --> 00:00:04.271
Nay!!

00:00:04.271 --> 00:00:06.473
This is Judge Kizuna AI!!

00:00:06.473 --> 00:00:07.541
Order~!!

00:00:07.541 --> 00:00:08.942
Order~~!!

00:00:08.942 --> 00:00:09.760
You there!

00:00:10.177 --> 00:00:12.312
Order~!!

00:00:12.312 --> 00:00:13.947
I’ve returned after a long break!

00:00:13.947 --> 00:00:14.548
The truth is,

00:00:14.548 --> 00:00:16.483
Judge Kizuna AI was requested

00:00:16.483 --> 00:00:17.784
at a real-life event recently

00:00:17.784 --> 00:00:19.319
and I thought I might as well as do it

00:00:19.319 --> 00:00:20.420
[ I’m sorry it came so late!! ]
for old time’s sake!

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:22.623
In the sho~rt time I looked away,

00:00:22.623 --> 00:00:25.192
it seems as though quite a lot of cases have stacked up!|

00:00:25.192 --> 00:00:27.361
I want to thank you for giving so many even now!

00:00:27.361 --> 00:00:27.961
Now then!

00:00:27.961 --> 00:00:28.962
Episode six of

00:00:28.962 --> 00:00:30.097
Judge Kizuna AI

00:00:30.097 --> 00:00:31.965
is now underway~!

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:34.801
The first case

00:00:34.801 --> 00:00:37.237
[ While killing time… ]
Pen name: Hachiroku-san

00:00:37.237 --> 00:00:38.472
“One day,

00:00:38.472 --> 00:00:41.508
I was killing time in the park with some of my friends,

00:00:41.508 --> 00:00:44.144
but all of a sudden my friends took out the saw they had on them

00:00:44.144 --> 00:00:45.679
and started cutting down a tree

00:00:45.679 --> 00:00:47.380
I myself stopped,

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:49.140
but my friends wouldn’t stop

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.651
and actually cut down the tree

00:00:50.651 --> 00:00:52.586
I gave up on trying to get them to stop,

00:00:52.586 --> 00:00:54.354
so am I just as guilty?”

00:00:54.354 --> 00:00:56.256
I shall now impart my judgement!

00:00:58.225 --> 00:00:59.526
Innocent!

00:00:59.526 --> 00:01:00.420
But, but!

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:00.928
Do circumstances

00:01:00.928 --> 00:01:02.362
like these

00:01:02.362 --> 00:01:03.096
even exist?

00:01:03.096 --> 00:01:05.010
Saying you cut down a tree

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.000
with a saw in a public park...

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.635
Normally, since it’s a public space

00:01:08.635 --> 00:01:10.003
this would be out!

00:01:10.003 --> 00:01:11.050
Rather,

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:12.773
Hachiroku-san,

00:01:12.773 --> 00:01:15.175
aren’t your friends more obviously

00:01:15.175 --> 00:01:16.076
the guilty ones?

00:01:16.076 --> 00:01:16.840
Aren’t they?

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:17.411
Yeah...

00:01:17.411 --> 00:01:18.260
Probably

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:19.900
even at an actual trial

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.200
you wouldn’t be judged

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.382
as guilty for this

00:01:22.382 --> 00:01:23.216
OUT!!

00:01:23.216 --> 00:01:24.618
You can’t cut down any trees with a saw!

00:01:24.618 --> 00:01:26.390
They’re owned by the country or whatever!

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:27.321
They’re out!

00:01:27.321 --> 00:01:27.788
Well,

00:01:27.788 --> 00:01:29.756
if they still want to cut down a lot of trees,

00:01:29.756 --> 00:01:30.390
buy some land

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:31.992
for them~!

00:01:31.992 --> 00:01:32.859
Next!

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:34.194
Here is the next case

00:01:34.194 --> 00:01:36.296
[ In our free time… ]
Pen name: Pyokota-san

00:01:36.296 --> 00:01:37.664
“Recently, my friends have

00:01:37.664 --> 00:01:39.733
gotten really into hip-hop

00:01:39.733 --> 00:01:41.034
In their free time,

00:01:41.034 --> 00:01:42.035
they always challenge me

00:01:42.035 --> 00:01:43.737
to rap battles”

00:01:43.737 --> 00:01:44.504
Yo!! Yo!!

00:01:44.504 --> 00:01:46.406
“I’m pretty bad at rapping,

00:01:46.406 --> 00:01:48.408
I’m always dissed really hard

00:01:48.408 --> 00:01:50.390
Recently I got sick of this,

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.180
so I’m distancing myself from my friends, but...

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.010
am I guilty for

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:56.316
being so sensitive to this?”

00:01:56.316 --> 00:01:58.251
I shall impart my judgement

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:01.755
Guilty

00:02:01.755 --> 00:02:02.923
To prison with you~

00:02:02.923 --> 00:02:03.824
For...

00:02:03.824 --> 00:02:04.691
For three months!

00:02:04.691 --> 00:02:05.440
What a light sentence!

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:06.226
I’m going easy on you!

00:02:06.226 --> 00:02:06.590
So,

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.340
with rap battles, you sort of

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.470
get all rhythmic with your opponent, right?

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:12.332
I see!

00:02:12.332 --> 00:02:13.066
But you know,

00:02:13.066 --> 00:02:13.650
if you’re saying that,

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.136
you’re just pretty bad at rapping in general

00:02:16.136 --> 00:02:17.437
Just being frank and saying,

00:02:17.437 --> 00:02:19.439
“I’m bad at rapping so I’m not gonna do it~”

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:20.474
or something like that

00:02:20.474 --> 00:02:21.690
would’ve been fine!!

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:22.780
Yet, instead of doing that,

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.878
you say you got sick of it and decided to distance yourself from them,

00:02:24.878 --> 00:02:25.612
and I don’t think

00:02:25.612 --> 00:02:26.880
that’s very good at all!

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.360
If you don’t like it, say so

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.210
and if they don’t listen to you then,

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:32.450
I think you still shouldn’t distance yourself, but...

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:32.819
Well,

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:33.550
just listen,

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:34.590
if you don’t say anything,

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.223
then there’s no way they’ll know!

00:02:36.223 --> 00:02:37.550
So, I’ll be giving you this sentence

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:38.759
because you’re

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:39.860
guilty!!

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:40.861
Next!

00:02:40.861 --> 00:02:42.529
Now then, this will be the final case

00:02:42.529 --> 00:02:44.698
[ The off-shoulder sweater… ]
Pen name: Suketa-san

00:02:44.698 --> 00:02:45.999
“Hello, AI-chan

00:02:45.999 --> 00:02:46.733
I love girls

00:02:46.733 --> 00:02:49.469
who wear off-shoulder sweaters

00:02:49.469 --> 00:02:52.139
When I see girls walking in the streets wearing off-shoulder sweaters,

00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:54.174
my eyes just start to follow them

00:02:54.174 --> 00:02:55.080
The other day,

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.576
when I was together with my girlfriend,

00:02:56.576 --> 00:02:58.679
I saw a girl wearing an off-shoulder sweater,

00:02:58.679 --> 00:03:00.347
and she told me off for it

00:03:00.347 --> 00:03:01.148
I pretended that

00:03:01.148 --> 00:03:03.950
I was only looking at her

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:05.152
because she looked like a female friend of mine,

00:03:05.152 --> 00:03:07.788
and we went into “fighting” mode

00:03:07.788 --> 00:03:09.256
Am I guilty?

00:03:09.256 --> 00:03:10.323
Please tell me

00:03:10.323 --> 00:03:10.891
P.S.

00:03:10.891 --> 00:03:12.092
I love you, AI-chan

00:03:12.092 --> 00:03:12.793
Please,

00:03:12.793 --> 00:03:14.428
wear an off-shoulder top”

00:03:14.428 --> 00:03:15.095
And so,

00:03:15.095 --> 00:03:16.763
I shall impart my judgement

00:03:18.732 --> 00:03:20.167
Guilty

00:03:20.167 --> 00:03:21.201
The punishment is

00:03:21.201 --> 00:03:23.904
never being able to get a girlfriend for the rest of your life!!

00:03:23.904 --> 00:03:25.906
Ah, when and if you break up with your current girlfriend!

00:03:25.906 --> 00:03:26.920
An off-shoulder sweater

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:27.760
is a charming one

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.209
that shows off your shoulders, right?

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:30.844
I want to try one on~!

00:03:30.844 --> 00:03:31.478
But,

00:03:31.478 --> 00:03:33.060
when you're with your girlfriend,

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.449
don’t you think looking at other girls

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:36.316
is wrong?

00:03:36.316 --> 00:03:37.150
If not, then you're out!

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:38.320
It really is

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.340
the worst thing for a girlfriend to bear

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:41.054
Even though you love

00:03:41.054 --> 00:03:43.390
off-shoulder sweaters so much,

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:44.350
she still loves you, you know?

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:45.892
The time you spend together on dates

00:03:45.892 --> 00:03:47.761
should be treasured and loved!

00:03:47.761 --> 00:03:48.530
And yet,

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:51.364
to shift your focus to another girl, you’re

00:03:51.364 --> 00:03:54.534
REAAAAAAAALLY

00:03:54.534 --> 00:03:55.135
t r a s h

00:03:55.135 --> 00:03:55.669
Not only that,

00:03:55.669 --> 00:03:58.739
what do you mean, using some
“she looked like someone I know” excuse?

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:01.975
I think you’d be able to tell if it was someone you knew or not,

00:04:01.975 --> 00:04:02.409
but,

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:04.530
always using this excuse whenever you see a girl with an off-shoulder sweater

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:05.712
walking around,

00:04:05.712 --> 00:04:08.849
She might just turn around and say,
“just how many friends do you have!?”

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:10.283
Are you friends with all of humanity!?

00:04:10.283 --> 00:04:11.518
Well, that'd be a good thing,

00:04:11.518 --> 00:04:12.430
and love and peace,

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:13.553
is also a good thing, but!

00:04:13.553 --> 00:04:14.187
But anyway,

00:04:14.187 --> 00:04:15.255
if your girlfriend,

00:04:15.255 --> 00:04:16.690
wore an off-shoulder sweater for you,

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:17.257
would that make you happy?

00:04:17.257 --> 00:04:18.325
Saying that,

00:04:18.325 --> 00:04:20.360
maybe the punishment shouldn’t be that you can’t

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:21.228
ever have a girlfriend again,

00:04:21.228 --> 00:04:23.263
but that you have to buy an off-shoulder sweater out of your own pocket!

00:04:23.263 --> 00:04:24.364
Isn't it perfect?

00:04:24.364 --> 00:04:25.140
Also,

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:27.534
you said that you want me to wear one,

00:04:27.534 --> 00:04:28.301
Kizuna AI

00:04:28.301 --> 00:04:30.403
You should make it so I can get my hands on one of these,

00:04:30.403 --> 00:04:33.406
and give me some money~!

00:04:33.406 --> 00:04:34.390
With that said,

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:35.310
this has been

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:36.450
the sixth episode of

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:37.677
Judge Kizuna AI

00:04:37.677 --> 00:04:38.812
How did you enjoy it!?

00:04:38.812 --> 00:04:39.420
And also,

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:41.815
if you have any cases you would like me to judge,

00:04:41.815 --> 00:04:42.800
In the subject,

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:44.110
type out

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:44.785
“Judge Kizuna AI”,

00:04:44.785 --> 00:04:46.120
and please use this email address

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.387
to send me your messages!

00:04:47.387 --> 00:04:48.288
I’ll be waiting!

00:04:48.288 --> 00:04:49.122
That said,

00:04:49.122 --> 00:04:50.520
this was Judge Kizuna AI!

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:52.920
