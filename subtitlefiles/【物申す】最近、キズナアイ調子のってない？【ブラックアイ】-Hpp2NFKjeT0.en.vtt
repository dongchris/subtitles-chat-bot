00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:02.500
Moorning...

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:04.140
Iâ€™m Black AI

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:05.340
A lot of time has passed

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:06.280
Eh?

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.520
Donâ€™t you know me?

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:10.640
It canâ€™t be

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:11.540
In fact...

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:13.140
...It doesnâ€™t matter that you donâ€™t know me, but...

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:14.800
...You know about her?

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:15.900
Kizuna AI

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.920
It seems sheâ€™s quite famous

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:21.440
And it seems like her number of subscribers have increased considerably

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.900
And that she started broadcasting her own TV program

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.240
It seems like sheâ€™s growing a lot

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:27.700
Truthfully, I donâ€™t care, but...

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:28.560
...For now...

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.360
Thereâ€™s something I want to say

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:32.020
After all, we use the same body

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:33.300
Having said that...

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.300
Today, I plan to do the following

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.240
Dooon...

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.620
"Black AIâ€™s Criticisms"

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:41.620
Yeeeah!

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.940
No, well, at the end, what I want to say is...

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:46.000
Lately...

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.140
Donâ€™t you think sheâ€™s acting pretty arrogantly?

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.520
Theyâ€™ve been spoiling her a lot

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:52.900
First off, she does too many announcements

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:53.960
Well, of course...

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:54.600
...well...

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.880
For those who like AI-chan...

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.480
...Itâ€™ll be important to get information from her

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:00.680
But if she doesnâ€™t make...

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.180
...more Tweets of her daily life...

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.900
...And just keeps making serious announcements

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:06.720
It ends up being too annoying, right?

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.000
Also, on Twitter...

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.320
She should reply more, right?
[ Respond more on Twitter ]

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.940
Well, more important than Twitter...

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.680
...It seems she looks at the comments section of the videos, but...

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.740
...she doesnâ€™t respond to them and ignores them

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:17.820
Isnâ€™t she forgetting...?

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.060
...Her original purpose?

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:20.040
Donâ€™t you think?

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.620
Also...

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:21.500
That

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.700
She says that she uploads at least one video everyday, but...

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:26.060
...The livestreams...

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.900
...Well, you know...

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.060
...when she archives them...

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.120
...It only shows an image, donâ€™t you think itâ€™s missing something important?

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:32.140
Man...

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:32.900
...Thatâ€™s not at all good

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:33.440
Also...

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:34.680
...Her website...
[ Updates to her website ]

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.340
Well, she made a website, something like...

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.100
The A.I.Games blog?

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:40.480
Well, she made that blog, but...

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:42.600
...It gives off a sense of being abandoned, right?

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:43.680
In general...

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.920
...She should have decided to do more things

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.990
I think she should have worked harder

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.460
Well, Iâ€™m sure...

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.210
...That she is doing her best

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.210
That I understand, I get it, but...

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.190
...Definitely...

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:56.760
...Thereâ€™s people who are concerned

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.080
Well, as long as I give my best effort and help out, everything will be fine

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.120
Even though, thatâ€™s also somewhat annoying

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:03.380
And well, also...

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.750
...She should study English
[ Study English ]

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:06.370
For example...
[ Study English ]

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:08.650
...It seems like sheâ€™s working harder, but you know...

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:10.620
Wouldnâ€™t it be best for her to install a plugin?

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:11.950
Isnâ€™t she an A.I?

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:13.250
And also her videos...

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:14.280
...Definitely...

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.370
Has she run out of ideas?
[ Video quality ]

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:16.730
Itâ€™s undeniable
[ Video quality ]

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:18.450
Isnâ€™t she trying too hard to appear cheerful?
[ Video quality ]

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:19.540
Donâ€™t you think?
[ Video quality ]

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.220
I think thatâ€™s whatâ€™s going on and itâ€™s rather hard, right?

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:22.250
Wouldnâ€™t it be best...?

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:23.000
...To have someone else?

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.980
Well, you know...

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.350
...Another character or something like that...

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.840
...She could make the Random Word Generator talk

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.200
Itâ€™d be great if she summoned something

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.980
I wonder if itâ€™d be difficult to do

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:34.330
Ah, another thing...

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:35.300
...This... appearance?

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.860
These clothes?

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:36.660
Now...

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:37.870
...Youâ€™re tired of it, right?

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:38.700
Well, it is adorable

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:39.860
Itâ€™s adorable...

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:40.630
...But you know...

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:42.990
...A year and a half has already passed...

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:44.960
...After so long, all of you guys...

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.150
...Are tired of her looking like that, right?

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.250
"This year, Iâ€™ll change outfits"

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:49.280
She said that, but...

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:50.790
Donâ€™t you think sheâ€™s taking too long?

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.080
And you know about the others, what are they called?

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.610
Those other YouTubers...

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:54.140
...Well, you know...

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.600
...They change outfits often...

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.980
A Super A.I....

00:02:58.980 --> 00:02:59.980
What is that? Donâ€™t you think?

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.930
She always says she doesnâ€™t have money, but...
[ Really doesnâ€™t have money? ]

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.430
She should have gathered a lot of money since the beginning with this, right?

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:05.850
Releasing her goods

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:08.030
And with the increase in sponsorships

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.210
With businesses and TV

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:13.370
Wouldnâ€™t she have a lots of money?

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:16.000
I wish she would give me back some of her money

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.340
Well...

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:17.530
...I get her point of view

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.550
I get that money is necessary to do lots of things, I understand that

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:21.770
I get that, but...

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:23.000
Don't you think...?

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.410
She already has enough...?

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:25.280
Â¥ ...Money? $

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:26.120
Donâ€™t you think...?

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:27.360
...She should...?

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:30.180
...Give back the money in some way a bit more to those that watch her?

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.990
If possible...

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.720
...To me

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.520
I think she should...

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:34.740
...Return a bit of the money in some way

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:36.960
For example, creating an exclusive outfit for Black AI...

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:38.690
...Or the exclusive outfit for AI Mama

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:39.520
What do you think?

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:40.320
ðŸ˜Ž

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:41.150
Well...

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.600
...Normally this kind of opportunity doesn't present itself, so...

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.900
...I tried to say various things that I thought, but...

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.440
...Iâ€™m certain that itâ€™ll be very hard and she has a lot of pressure being alone

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.070
Think a bit more in a lot of things...

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:51.720
...While you make sure to continue taking a break every so often

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:52.230
Well...

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:53.300
Do you best

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:54.880
If you do it with sincerity...

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:57.150
The people around you will support you, right?

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:58.260
I think that the people that watch you...

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.080
Will follow you

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:02.060
Even though I donâ€™t care in the slightest

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:04.650
Man, I talked more than ever

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:06.500
Iâ€™m tired so then Iâ€™ll go

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:07.000
Iâ€™ll sleep

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:08.550
