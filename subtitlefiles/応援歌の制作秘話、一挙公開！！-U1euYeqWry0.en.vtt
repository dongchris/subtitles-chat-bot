00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.310
Backstage interview on "That Song’s” production!
*[Parody Song] I tried to sing the first support song with my lyrics! [Senbonzakura] #170

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:06.650
*It looks like you've gone with a parody song this time, but were you worried at any particular point in making it?*

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:09.060
Ah, well, yes
*Kizuna Ai - Singer*

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:13.030
I've made a conscious effort to keep the rhyme and rhythm the same as the original

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:16.700
So that the song still feels the same

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:19.300
Like changing "Free and easy"...

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.050
To "Ai Ai cheering"...

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.670
Or "This is a feast"...

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.780
To "And now here I sing"...

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:28.380
Or "The world in eternal darkness"...

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:29.160
Well...

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.960
To "In this bright world, wherever you are"...

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.810
As much as possible, I've tried to be careful...

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:37.310
To keep the world of Cryptract...

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:39.190
And the world of Senbonzakura...

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.430
Alive, while putting my rhymes together

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:46.250
*What part of the song do you feel most confident about?*

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.920
Hmm… Rather than anything I felt confident in…

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.180
I'd say that is the part that I tried to solve intelligently

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.800
Like, a part where I thought "That's it!"

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.490
Like changing "guillotine" to "the best"...

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:58.390
Or "ray gun" to "mythical creatures"...

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:00.960
They're words that I think of when I see Cryptract...

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.580
But I tried to use similar words to those of the original song too, what do you think?

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.910
*But changing "A thousand cherry trees disappear into the night" to "Genjuu Keiyaku Cryptract", that was a stretch*

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.130
Yeah, it kind of was... uhm...

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:13.110
You'll learn when you're ol--!

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.450
*Of course, this was a cheer song, right?*

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.050
Yes! That’s right

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:21.380
*Then why on more than one occasion the lyrics were talking about yourself?*

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:22.730
Actually, in the beginning...

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:25.410
Well, I made all the lyrics about myself, bu-

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:28.750
*How did it feel to be "Kizuna Ai, the Singer"?*

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:30.650
Well, it was, you know…
*Director of audiography*

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:32.860
It was great, of course
*Director of audiography*

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:35.600
I've got a part, do you want to see it?

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.920
"You are my friend, #BFF, Yay!"

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.310
Director: Ai-chan!

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.270
D: Maybe we should change the “Yay” a bit...

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:44.740
A: Ah, yes! Got it!

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:48.180
A: What kind of feeling should I put into the "Yay"...?

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.770
D: Hmm...

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.980
D: Yeah, maybe be your usual energetic self

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:52.730
A: Got it!

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:54.940
A: Ah… wait a moment...

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:57.020
A: Hello everyone!

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:00.430
A: Hello everyone! Virtual Youtuber, Kizuna Ai here!

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:02.130
A: Ah! I'm good to go!

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.900
D: Hm? Good, let's go

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:05.880
A: Yaaay!

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:07.420
A: How was that?

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.550
NoriP: What do you mean, how was that? What even was that?

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.980
A: Huh?

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:15.920
A: Why, it's Kizuna Ai's Senbonzakura's special broadcast, of course

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.650
N: Eh? But… you're not in it...

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:20.370
A: Eh? I'm not in it?!

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:25.850
N: No, you're not in it, and if I had to put a name to it, it'd should be a Cryptract Senbonzakura, right?

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:27.180
A: Eeeeh? No!

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.920
A: After all the effort I went into making it!

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.760
A: I was told I was free to choose the video!

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.730
A: No, no, no, no, no!

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.120
A: Let me appear! Let me appear! Let me appear!

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:36.820
A: No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:40.830
N: Um... could I just get you to cheer on Cryptract?

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:41.470
A: Ah...

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:43.650
A: Yes, of course, of course!

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.140
A: Man, NoriP-san...

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.950
A: Alright, well let's do it! Cryptract!

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.750
N: Ai-chan... Have you ever played "The Room of Reason"?

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:54.940
A: Well, it turns out that...

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:59.000
A: To be honest with you, I don't really get it

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.310
N: You really are honest, aren't you?

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:04.500
N: To tell you the truth, we've renewed that section

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.650
A: Ooh! Really? Eh?

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:08.020
N: Yeah
A: What's changed?

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:11.980
N: What was it... you can now challenge all of the mythical creatures!
*Excluding recent additions*

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.130
A: I see, so that means...

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.930
A: You can go on to fight the hard ones, right?

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:18.610
N: Yes, you can say that

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:22.650
A: Ahhhh! Can I do it? Can I do it?

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.260
N: Don't worry...
A: ...I'm wearing pants?

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:26.800
N: Mmm?

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:30.000
N: In this occasion, I will be properly guiding you through it

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.730
A: Eh? That's nice, what happened?

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:35.520
N: I want you to beat it in a really great way, so then...

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.900
A: I see! I mean, that's great!

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:39.720
A: That’s what I wanted!

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.920
N: Well then, I know this is somewhat sudden, but...

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:43.980
N: Ai-chan, could you show me your characters?

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.800
A: Yep, yep

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:50.200
N: This time, could you challenge the mythical beast called “Baphomet”?

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.080
N: And these are the characters you have at the moment

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:56.660
A: Yes
N: You've got a lot of strong ones, haven't you?
A: That’s right, I got a lot of them!

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:59.200
N: The Reflection skill...
A: Yes, yes

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:00.700
N: That's pretty important

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:02.910
A: Ooh, so it counters an attack or something?

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:03.920
N: That's right, that's right

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:08.590
N: So, you're going to need units that have that skill...
A: Mmhm...

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:09.450
N: Oh!

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:11.140
N: You don’t have Bizarre?

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:13.850
A: Do I... need one?

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:15.390
N: No, you're fine without one, but...

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:19.780
A: Hmm!
N: But it has the Reflection skill, so then Bizarre...

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:23.370
N: Well, it would have been great to use him this time

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:25.180
A: Oh, I s-see...

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:27.850
N: *laughs* You really don't like that one, do you?
A: Umm...

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:30.310
A: This is one that's come out recently, but...
N: Sure, sure, sure

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:31.980
A: Look, probably... yeah...

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:35.040
A: He's a guy, and he's not cute...

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:38.130
A: And... he's level one!

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:40.360
N: That's true, why haven’t you trained him?

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:43.830
A: Because he's not cuuute!
N: *laughs* But he's really strong!

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:45.680
A: Eh? Noone other than him...?
N: Right

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:48.930
A: So none of the cute girls have this skill?

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:52.120
N: Ah, well, there probably are some, but...
A: Hmm...

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:54.190
N: But uh, take a look at the skills

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:55.750
A: He looks powerful...

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:58.650
N: He can recover an ally's entire HP

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:00.320
A: He's strong, right?

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:02.860
A: He's strong, right?
N: He's strong, right?

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:04.880
N: He also has Blessing

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:06.060
A: Ah! So he won't die!

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:06.660
N: That's right

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:08.040
A: Ooh! Eh? But...

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.420
A: If I use it... ehm...

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:13.680
A: If I win... I can use some iTunes cards

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:14.780
*NoriP laughs*

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:15.620
N: That’s the first thing you think of

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:17.780
N: Well... ehm...

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:19.820
N: For the moment, concentrate on beating it together

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:20.580
N: Do your best!

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:21.080
A: Oh!

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:22.060
A: I have no other choice...

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:23.800
A: Because it's NoriP's request

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:25.340
N: First, make sure to train him, okay?

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:26.120
N: At Bizarre

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:27.040
A: Ah, I see

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:28.360
A: Please leave it to me!

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:29.920
A: This is a piece of cake
N: Really?

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:31.160
A: What do you think?

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:32.640
A; I gave them some training!

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:33.440
N: This time...

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:33.980
A: Yes!

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:35.260
A: Hmhmm...
N: If you put most of your points...

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:36.980
A: Yes
N: Into the reflection skill...

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:39.740
N: You can strike back powerful attacks!

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:40.680
A: Strike them back!

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:42.360
A: Sort of like *pakow*, right?

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:43.240
N: That's right!

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.520
N: First of all, this one has the most points...

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:46.080
A: Hmm...

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:47.900
N: In the third wave...

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:49.680
N: And with Baphomet too...

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:50.780
N: Have the Square of Darkness

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:51.520
A: Ah!

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:53.580
A: Yes, yes, yes
N: You have that square, but...

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:56.080
A: They use poison attacks on you

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:57.340
A: Aaah, that’s not good

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:00.000
N: Well, if you get affected by that p-poison...

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.170
N: Your HP goes down by 75%

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:05.890
A: 75%?!
N: That’s right

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:06.650
A: That’s a lot...

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:11.400
A: Mmm… mmm, ah!
N: That’s why you should turn that back onto your opponent with the Reflection barrier

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:16.760
N: That way, you can cause massive damage to Baphomet
A: That’s right!

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:17.560
A: Ooohh!

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:19.460
A: That's very nice
N: Very nice

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:21.860
A: But, if you can't land the counterattack...

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:23.780
A: You're in trouble, right?
N: That’s right

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:24.240
A: I see

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:28.990
N: Also, since he has Blessing, and there are, well, lots of enemies...

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:34.060
N: You'll definitely need a unit with Multi-Strike too, I think

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:35.240
A: Dorothy-chan!

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:36.680
A: Yeah, Dorothy
A: Tiana-chan!

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:38.480
N: You've got Tiana, right?
A: Oh! Mhm...

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:41.290
N: So I think this time, this formation is good enough

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:43.500
N: Tiana, Bizarre, Dorothy, Crista
A: Oh!

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:45.310
A: Perfect, isn't it?

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:47.660
A: This... is Baphomet
N: That's right

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:49.960
A: Then let's get started!

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:53.730
A: Oh! We've started!
N: Well...

00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:56.350
N: Here's the first wave, for a start
A: Yeah

00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:58.340
N: This is, uh...
A: So cute!

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:02.960
N: *laughs* That's because this is a wave from the event that's on right now
A: Oh, oh

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:05.380
N: Let's do this quickly
A: Let's go, how adorable

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:07.120
A: Ahh!
N: This is where it really begins

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:10.500
A: These... these... these guys look strong

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:18.360
N: Well, one... well, this... with respect to this wave, you must use the skills little by little to defeat them

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:23.580
A: Ah! I think I’m not doing so bad, right?
N: Yeah, it’s true

00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:28.590
N: This was as safe as I thought it would be, hmm
A: You’re right

00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:31.070
N: You could probably do this on auto

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:35.680
A: But I defeated the guys at the start straight away

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:38.650
N: That's true, and I really think you've improved

00:07:38.890 --> 00:07:42.400
A: Yeah
N: You've found a lot of powerful units..

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:47.640
A: Yeah, that’s right
N: So I'd say you're an advanced player, and that's no exaggeration

00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:49.310
A: Gamer Kizuna Ai…

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:51.320
A: She swung it in the air!

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:56.640
A: Eh? It's suddenly got a lot more difficult
N: That's right, there's a fair chance we'll get killed here

00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:57.360
A: There is!

00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:59.300
A: I'll focus
N: So please focus

00:08:00.210 --> 00:08:01.680
A: Aaaaahhhhhh!

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:04.860
A: If I didn’t have Blessing, I’d be dead
N: Yes, that’s right

00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:09.380
N: From here on, you're going to need to save up your skills for the next part
A: Ah, yeah. I'll conserve them!

00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:10.540
N: Oh? Not much further

00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:11.800
A: That's right
N: Mmm...

00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:15.660
A: I should conserve my skills and recover my HP
N: That’s right

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:17.820
A: Oh! Just in time
N: Oh!

00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:19.280
A: Wasn’t that a great moment?

00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:21.500
A: The hard part starts from now!
N: Starting from now, right?

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:24.060
A: Oh!

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:25.180
A: The entrance on the stage is...

00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:26.480
A: Great

00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:28.200
N: This enemy that has a light...

00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:29.080
N: Eeehh...

00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:32.200
A: Yes
N: That square purple enemy...

00:08:32.660 --> 00:08:38.300
A: Mmm... mmm... Ah! mmm.... mmm... yes...

00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:40.100
N: And then, this...

00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:44.620
A: Mmm... mmm...
N: Enemy that’s square-shaped, has a timer

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:45.260
A: Ah!

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:46.420
A: Something like: "One, two, three"?

00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:47.560
A: "One, two, three", right?
N: That’s right, that’s right

00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:50.780
N: When the timer ends, you need to have the counterattack barrier up
A: Ah...

00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:51.800
A: I see
N: Yes

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:52.560
A: I understand

00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:53.760
A: Ah, sensei!

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:57.160
N: The bone is...
A: Yes

00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:00.360
N: Once you have placed the Reflection barrier...
A: Yes

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:03.000
N: It’ll take away your skills
A: Yes

00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:05.320
A: This is very dangerous, right?

00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:05.920
N: That’s right

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:07.000
A: That means I should defeat it...

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.800
N: You need to defeat it first
A: I see

00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:11.580
N: Let’s do it!
A: Let’s do it! March!

00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:12.720
A: Teeeiii!

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:13.900
A: Prepare yourself!

00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:16.660
A: Ah, I’m not doing any damage to it

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:19.600
A: This... Here I go!

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:25.160
A: Eh?
N: I’d like to defeat the enemies, but...

00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:27.640
N: This kind of bone... well, let’s say bone...

00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:28.140
A: Yes

00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:30.760
N: It’s very powerful, it’s very hard, right?

00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:31.460
A: It’s hard?

00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:33.900
A: In that case, I should weaken it...

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.260
A: I should weaken it, right?

00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:39.700
N: I’m sure that Ai-sensei will be fine
A: It’s true

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:40.880
N: Oh, now...!

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:42.080
N: You're so close from beating them...

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:44.080
A: It’s true, Ah! But the enemy also...

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:45.980
A: Has Blessing, so then...
N: That’s right

00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:48.580
A: Man, what an uncomfortable situation

00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:51.140
N: Here is where you should use consecutive attacks, right?

00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:51.980
A: It’s true

00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:53.180
A: This... should be...
N: Yes...

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:57.140
A: Of course, you can’t beat it before it uses it’s poison...

00:09:57.860 --> 00:09:59.400
N: No, you can beat it earlier

00:09:59.400 --> 00:09:59.900
A: I see

00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:01.580
N: Yes, that’s right
A: That was just an excuse

00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:03.620
A: Let’s go! Let’s go!

00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:05.240

A: Oh! I did a lot of...

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:08.720
A: Although I still got a bit to go, right?

00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:11.060
A: Toiyaa!

00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:14.080
A: The bone... the bone is very hard

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:17.360
A: Ah, I have little HP, I’m in trouble, right?

00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:21.620
N: That was good, right?
A: That was good, right?

00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:22.860
A: Ah? Mmm?

00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:23.920
A: What is this?

00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:25.500
A: Ouch!

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:26.840

00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:46.160
A: With this, I’ll be fine, right?

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:47.700
A: I can use it, right?

00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:49.160
A: Eh? But... wait... but...

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:50.980
A: The bone... The bone still hasn’t died

A: The bone...

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:08.440
A: It’s not certain that it takes your skills, right?

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:09.540
N: That’s right
A: That’s right

00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:10.460
A: Depending on luck, right?

00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:13.080
A: Well, I’m a lucky A.I, so then...

00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:14.480

00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:50.920
A: It’s a bad boy...

00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:52.980

00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:09.660
A: Oh! Ah! Ah!

00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:10.460
