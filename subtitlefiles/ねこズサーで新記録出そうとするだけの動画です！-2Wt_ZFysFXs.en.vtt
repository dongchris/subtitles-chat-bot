00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.660
Hello everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai here!

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:06.140
Persian, Munchkin, Bengali, Sphinx

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:07.980
Everyone, do you know what those are?

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:09.180
The right answer is...

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:10.500
Cats~

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:11.220
Meow

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:14.300
That's right, I reeeeally love cats

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:17.440
Speaking about it, I found a cute cat app today

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:19.800
Let's go install and try it!

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.120
Install!

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:24.840
Ugh

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.640
Yes! Anyways, I want to try my paw at it

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:28.400
Meow?

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:29.520
Meow?

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:31.460
Yes, well then...

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:35.320
Today we will do an app called "Neko Zusa" (Sliding cat)

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:36.600
We will go slide

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.680
We have to purrsue a good distance

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:39.440
Meow?

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.960
Maybe a bug entered me when I was installing?

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.240
So he's named Catty, right? 
*Flick Catty and let's do the approach run!*

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.840
Whoosh

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:45.400
Eh?

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:47.940
He's so slow

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.800
Ah, because I went over the white line 
*If you don't slide before you pass the white line, you're out!*

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:53.740
I understand

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:55.420
The real issue is that he should be faster

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:56.400
This... QUICKLY!

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:56.900
Huh?

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:58.040
Quickly!

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:59.640
So slow, lol

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:01.140
*inhales*

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:02.560
You're slow!

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:04.100
Go for it! Go for it!

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:05.520
Go for it! Go for it! Go for it! Go for it!

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:06.540
Go for it~

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.220
Go for it~

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.080
You're slow~

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.400
At least go faster!

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.260
Good, you did-

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.880
Encourage...

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:13.920
I’m encouraging you so much

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:14.580
Super encouraging

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.120
Go for it! Go for it!

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.060
That was no good at all, right?

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:21.460
Even though I was encouraging that unskillful cat...

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.620
I have to do it in cat speak, right?

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.800
Okay

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:25.760
Meow-eow-eow-eow

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:26.340
Ah, wait, wait

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.020
That was fast

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.600
Meow-eow-eow… *laughs*

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:29.160
Meow-eow-eow…

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.820
A.I.Channeeeel!

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.600
I should be able to go a little further

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.440
Last time I readily got 4000, so...

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.440
As I thought, because we're making a video...

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.500
We have to set a new record!

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:42.460
Good. Here we go!

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:43.180
MEOW!

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:44.040
Huh?

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.580
Impawssible~!

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.160
That timing is way too fast!

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.900
Slip!

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:50.200
Eh? So slow...

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.180
Slip!

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:53.440
Good! Ah

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:55.100
Oh! Oh! Oh!

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:56.060
Ooh!

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:57.860
Go for it! Go for it!

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:59.200
Meow-eow-eow-eow...

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.660
Meow-eow-eow-eow-eow-eow-eow...

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:02.400
Meow-eow-eow...

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:02.900
Meow-eow...

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:03.760
Meow-eow-eow

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:04.760
I say at least 4000...

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:05.720
MEOW!

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:06.720
Meow-eow-eow-eow...

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:07.620
Meow-eow-eow-eow-eow!

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:08.300
A little bit more...

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.260
Good, good, good....

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:11.160
Ah, the last steps...

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:14.160
Regrettable...

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.900
Like this!

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:18.940
Ah, well this is a bit...

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:21.380
This isn’t good, it’s not even...

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:22.300
Stop! Stop! Stop!

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:23.060
Slip!

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.720
Oh!

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.620
Oh!

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.540
Oh! This is...

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.520
Don't you think this looks good?

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.900
Go for it! Go for it! Go for it!

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:30.980
Meow-eow-eow-eow...

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:31.740
Oho-ho-ho!

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:32.960
Ah, this might not be good

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:34.460
This really is not good, truly

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:36.260
Go for it! Go for it!

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:37.780
Meow-eow-eow-eow...

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:38.660
Encouraging, meow-eow-eow!

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:39.180
Meow-eow-eow!

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:40.540
At least...

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:41.840
A little further... a little further...

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.540
AAaah! Disappointing

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.540
Nooo!

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.860
Follow the love!

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.420
Ah, this sort of looks good

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:49.040
This...

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:50.240
This might be...

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.300
This might be good...

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.020
Don’t you think?

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:54.640
Go for it! Go for it! Go for it!

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:56.880
Ah, now it doesn't look good

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.360
Go for it! Go for it! Go for it!

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.160
Ah! Please~

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:02.980
Why~!

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:04.860
A.I.Channel~

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:06.060
Everyone...

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:07.560
This is our last match...

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:08.960
Well, this time, ehm...

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.140
I'll go overboard with pressing "Encourage"

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:12.840
I’ll keep pressing and we'll see how far we can extend it

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:13.940
I think I want to try that

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:14.860
Here we go!

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:15.780
Hoo!

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:17.800
This is a little bad... *laughs*

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:18.580
Hoo!

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:20.340
Hoi!

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:22.880
Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.600
It feels like he’s sliding very well

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:32.820
Go for it! Go for it! Go for it!

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.160
Meow-eow-eow-eow-eow...

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.940
Ah! Ah! Ah!

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.480
Meow-eow-eow-eow-eow-eow-eow...

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:39.780
Meow-eow-eow-eow...

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.020
Meow-eow-eow-eow-eow!

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.640
Ah!

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:42.800
I did it!

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:44.180
I got it!

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.220
I did iiit!
*New Record!*

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:47.460
I got it meow

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:48.060
Meow?

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:48.980
I got it...

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:50.020
I got it meow

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:51.180
I got it now, right?

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:52.240
Scratch, scratch, scratch

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:53.620
I got it now, right?

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.800
Well...

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:56.460
As expected of me

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:58.940
For the last, last time, I will purrform

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:04.320
There’s more at the end!

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.320
Translated by: Bararo

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:10.920
Mrew?

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:12.340
Mrew?

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:13.800
Mrew!

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:15.600
Mrew!?

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.780
Mmm?

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:18.360
Hmm _(-ω-`_)
