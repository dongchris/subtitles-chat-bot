I'm really glad we got those last group photos in.

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:19.240
Yeah, the photographer was nice.

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.000
I hope you don't get into trouble,

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:26.240
I know that it's a little later than I expected, and

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.240
I could've had Nanny drive me back

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:31.020
No, it's no problem.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:32.740
I'm happy to.

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:46.620
How're you feelin'?

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:47.800
Fine.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:49.760
You don't look fine.

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.180
Shut up, okay?

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:52.720
I'm just messing with you.

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:53.840
Don't be nervous, okay?

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:54.720
I know prom is a big night, so

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.540
just have fun, don't think about it too much.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.260
In a few years, you'll barely remember the whole thing.

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:00.580
Like me.

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.040
But I want to remember tonight.

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:04.800
That's good.

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:12.740
Hey,

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:14.380
I put something in your chest pocket.

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:19.400
I'm just saying,

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.320
I know how you kids are these days, okay?

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:22.940
I'm just tryna help!

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:25.100
Look,

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:26.540
stop tryna be a parent, okay?

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:27.780
That's what mom and dad are for.

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.280
It's there if you need it, okay?

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:32.060
Trust me on this.

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.400
Just be confident.

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:49.040
Alright,

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.840
we're here.

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:53.640
Thanks so much

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.520
for everything tonight.

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:56.380
Oh,

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:57.300
yeah.

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:58.340
Of course.

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:06.260
Lemme just,

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:07.220
do this outside.

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:28.460
Well, I

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:29.660
hope you had fun tonight.

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:31.380
I did.

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.440
Um, I really did. Thank you.

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.940
Yeah.

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:42.500
So, I

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:43.760
I guess I'll see you Monday?

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:46.120
Yeah.

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.020
Oh, here's your jacket back.

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.700
Yeah...

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.700
Thank you.

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:52.720
Sure.

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:16.300
"It's there if you need it, okay?"

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.920
Trust me on this,

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:19.080
just be confident.

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:34.840

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.100
What are you doing?

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.180
What did you think of the music tonight?

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:41.640
What?

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.980
Did you like the music that was playing at the dance tonight?

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:47.640
Yeah, I guess. It was

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:48.360
fun.

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:50.300
Yeah,

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:51.560
it was.

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:54.040
Well, it was alright.

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:56.440
But, um,

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.800
the DJ was missing something.

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:03.720
And what was that?

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:06.420
A slow song.

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:08.720
Would you

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:09.900
like to dance with me?

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:30.640
You know, I was

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:33.980
waiting the whole night for them to play something we could slow dance to, but

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:35.860
nothing ever came on,

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:38.660
and now we're just outside your houseâ€”

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:39.560
Stop talking.

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:45.800
I wouldn't have it any other way.
