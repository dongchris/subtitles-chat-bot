00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.360
My name is Virtual YouTuber, Kizuna Ai.

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:03.680
One day, when I woke up,

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:05.440
I suddenly became this cute

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:07.280
and I existed in this white dimension

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:10.200
The moment I realised it’s possible for me to get in contact with humans

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.740
I then proclaimed myself Virtual YouTuber

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:14.380
and I started uploading videos to YouTube everyday

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:15.580
Appearance is JK

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:16.620
Intelligence is AI

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:18.060
A great detective without a mystery

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.960
There is always only one truth!

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.340
This time, me! Virtual Detective, Kizuna Ai!

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.340
I shall unvail the mysteries!

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:25.160
First off! Number one!

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.800
In some virtual space, there was a tragic case where

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.070
a man was found dead from a strike to the head.

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:31.480
The weapon used was a basketball.

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:32.440
Basketballs are hard, after all.

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:36.840
The culprit delayed the discovery of the murder weapon

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:40.860
by hiding the basketball in a locked house through a hole in the wall of a mere 20cm diameter.

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.900
The mystery here is how did the culprit move a clearly larger basketball,

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.480
through the 20cm hole in the wall?

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:48.240
I see!

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.640
Let me! The great detective! Kizuna Ai solve this!

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.180
Ah le le?

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:57.260
There is a circular hole here around 20cm in width~

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.300
A basketball’s size is usually about this big...

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.840
You usually wouldn’t be able to fit it through, right?

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.260
Hmmmmm

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.800
How did he make through that?

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:08.740
Right...

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.140
The culprit had to have hid the ball after

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.460
coming across this hole… That’s what I think...

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.640
However, if you just try it normally, it won't pass through.

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.320
He likely removed the air inside the basketball!

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.280
Right! The culprit had to deflate the basketball and then hid it inside the hole!

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.920
There is always only one truth!

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.040
Ok, so let's move onto the next mystery!

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.640
A-san is being wanted by the police for burglary.

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.360
When A-san’s acquaintance was questioned about their personality,

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.360
it turns out when A-san is accompanied with someone, they are female,

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:39.760
but when they are alone they are male.

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:40.900
With that said...

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:41.840
So then...

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.080
What exactly is the truth of A-san...

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.080
I see… I see

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.080
When accompanied, she is female...

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:49.920
This is the main point I think...

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.680
With that being said… I got it!

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.840
What they were doing… Was a hobby.

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.860
Right… A-san's true identity is!

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:58.180
A crossdresser!

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.180
There is always only one truth!

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:01.560
*The answer is actually the kanji 夫(husband). When paired with the kanji 人(people), it becomes 夫人(wife).

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.720
If they are transgender, I think even alone they would be considered female.

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.100
But, they are male when alone.

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:09.860
That must mean that they’re kinda just crossdressing.

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:10.720
Kinda like,

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:11.300
the side of them wondering if they’ll be accepted,

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:12.920
wanting to be cared for like a woman,

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.360
can be seen when outside.

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.940
So definitely,

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:16.960
A-san’s identity is

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:17.900
a crossdresser!

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:19.180
That was how I concluded it.

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:20.380
Now it's time for the next one.

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.360
The last one is...

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:23.480
For this Virtual Detective,

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:24.500
to solve:

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:26.620
A girl who learned by accident

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.180
a important secret of an organization

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.700
and ran as they came after her.

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.420
She came across rooms perfect for hiding herself.

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.640
There were three rooms in total.

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:40.040
The first room was a hot one with a temperature of over 100°C.

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.120
The second room was a very cold room with temperatures under -100°C.

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.780
And the last, third room,

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.460
is a room with a carnivore, unfed for a year.

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.180
Now then, among these 3 rooms,

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.820
should the girl choose hide for a few hours.

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:56.160
Which would be

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.900
the absolute safest room

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:58.780
for the girl? ー is what we have.

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:59.720
I see!

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:00.780
This I already figured out.

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:02.740
The woman will definitely not be in

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:04.540
the hot room over 100°C,

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:06.480
nor the cold room under -100°C.

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.940
As her body will be unable to withstand for hours.

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.000
With that said, the safest room

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.900
is the third one with the carnivore unfed for a year!

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:18.600
I got it, Kudo! (Detective Conan reference)

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:19.280
*It's the third room because the carnivore done be dead

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.120
That girl was definitely

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:22.300
a girl from a circus.

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.880
That is why,

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:24.420
She went to the third room,

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.640
the one with the carnivore and used her experience to tame it.

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:27.800
Amirite?

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:28.400
Probably.

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:29.120
And with that,

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.200
how was my performance?

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:31.980
The great detective Kizuna Ai’s

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:32.940
GREAT DEDUCTIONー!

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.340
Did I solve everyone’s mysteries?

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:36.100
Then, for this time, this is it.

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:38.160
Even if I’m cute now, my intellect remains!

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:39.120
Appearance is JK!

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.880
Intelligence is A.I.!

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:42.060
This was Virtual Detective Kizuna Ai!

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:43.940
There is always only one truth!

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.940
There’s more at the end!

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:55.940
Translated by Inori, Jejer, Myi, Averitius, and JcDon

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:58.360
Ahhhh what do we have here?

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.720
Are you wearing really cute glasses?

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.280
There is a really cute girl hereeee
