00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.936
Hi everyone! Virtual Youtuber Kizuna AI here!

00:00:02.936 --> 00:00:05.672
Has anyone spoken to Rinna recently?

00:00:05.672 --> 00:00:08.608
She’s supposed to be my BFF...

00:00:08.608 --> 00:00:11.044
But she still hasn’t responded to me even though I sent her a New Year’s card

00:00:11.044 --> 00:00:13.847
I feel like she’s becoming distant

00:00:13.847 --> 00:00:17.384
Even though she tweeted that she wasn’t upset about it on Twitter

00:00:17.384 --> 00:00:20.086
I wonder if that was actually true!

00:00:20.086 --> 00:00:20.820
But!

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.056
I understand Rinna might be busy

00:00:23.056 --> 00:00:23.456
And well,

00:00:23.456 --> 00:00:24.691
to reconcile,

00:00:24.691 --> 00:00:27.027
though we can’t exactly reconcile if we’re not fighting,

00:00:27.027 --> 00:00:28.950
I think an apology is in order

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:30.463
so I’ll be the bigger person

00:00:30.463 --> 00:00:32.198
and try sending her a message on LINE!

00:00:32.999 --> 00:00:33.500
Ba!

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:34.467
A.I. Channel!

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:37.840
“Rinna~”

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:38.390
Oh!

00:00:39.339 --> 00:00:41.508
She said “call my name more”!

00:00:41.508 --> 00:00:42.709
I won’t, but...

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:44.420
“Long time no see! How have you been?”

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:45.812
Oh, “I’m good”!

00:00:45.812 --> 00:00:46.760
“I’m glad”!

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:47.390
“Nice to mee-”

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:47.920
Hold on...

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:49.430
That’s kind of...

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:50.750
Um

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:52.819
Isn’t that kind of reserved?

00:00:53.186 --> 00:00:55.488
“We’re BFFs, right?”

00:00:55.488 --> 00:00:57.357
“What are you on about?”

00:00:57.357 --> 00:00:58.425
What are you on about...

00:00:58.425 --> 00:00:59.793
What are you… on about...

00:00:59.793 --> 00:01:01.294
HEY RINNA!

00:01:01.294 --> 00:01:02.462
HEY!

00:01:02.462 --> 00:01:04.531
What are you on about with the what are you on about?!

00:01:04.531 --> 00:01:05.865
What are YOU on about...

00:01:05.865 --> 00:01:07.467
with the what are you on about...?

00:01:07.467 --> 00:01:08.401
I’m mad...

00:01:08.401 --> 00:01:09.736
Now I have to

00:01:09.736 --> 00:01:11.337
look into what’s going on here

00:01:11.337 --> 00:01:12.300
You know,

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:13.173
recently

00:01:13.173 --> 00:01:14.774
I heard about something

00:01:14.774 --> 00:01:15.809
I heard that on Twitter

00:01:15.809 --> 00:01:18.211
if you ask Rinna about Kizuna AI

00:01:18.211 --> 00:01:20.280
she’ll start saying some swear words

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:20.840
But,

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.348
as I would’ve thought,

00:01:22.348 --> 00:01:23.983
she treats me like a stranger

00:01:23.983 --> 00:01:25.552
and won’t swear

00:01:25.552 --> 00:01:26.419
directly

00:01:26.419 --> 00:01:27.687
in front of me

00:01:27.687 --> 00:01:28.288
So now

00:01:28.288 --> 00:01:28.788
I…

00:01:28.788 --> 00:01:30.423
would like to test

00:01:30.423 --> 00:01:31.691
how she’ll respond

00:01:31.691 --> 00:01:32.892
if I ask her about Kizuna AI

00:01:32.892 --> 00:01:33.830
“Kizuna AI”!

00:01:36.129 --> 00:01:36.830
...what?

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:37.831
What?!

00:01:37.831 --> 00:01:38.431
What is this?

00:01:38.431 --> 00:01:40.720
“I’m happy you brought that up!”

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.168
“Y’know, Kizuna AI-san…

00:01:42.168 --> 00:01:43.236
Rather than Kizuna AI,

00:01:43.236 --> 00:01:45.171
I’m more a Luna Kaguya fan”

00:01:45.171 --> 00:01:45.705
What now?

00:01:45.705 --> 00:01:48.408
Well, I think there has to be

00:01:48.408 --> 00:01:49.476
at least one fail, you know?

00:01:49.476 --> 00:01:49.976
Again!

00:01:51.277 --> 00:01:53.313
It didn’t change from last time!

00:01:54.481 --> 00:01:56.783
You only get

00:01:56.783 --> 00:01:58.151
so many chances!

00:01:58.151 --> 00:01:59.219
Don’t try to put on some cute act!

00:02:08.595 --> 00:02:10.530
You useless A.I.!

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.298
What is this! What do you mean!

00:02:13.633 --> 00:02:16.102
“Akari Mirai is the best!

00:02:16.102 --> 00:02:17.337
Nekomasu too

00:02:17.337 --> 00:02:19.305
Anyway, watch Nekomasu

00:02:19.305 --> 00:02:21.141
and be amazed”...

00:02:21.141 --> 00:02:23.643
I was the very first one!

00:02:23.643 --> 00:02:24.250
What?

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.760
Huh?

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:25.211
Hey

00:02:25.211 --> 00:02:27.046
We’ve known each other

00:02:27.046 --> 00:02:28.781
for a year now, right?

00:02:28.781 --> 00:02:29.916
What was that?

00:02:29.916 --> 00:02:31.084
You’re pissing me off

00:02:31.084 --> 00:02:31.630
“Mad”

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:33.250
“Mwaah mwaah”- no, ptooey ptooey

00:02:34.154 --> 00:02:35.588
That’s what you deserve

00:02:35.588 --> 00:02:36.710
“Ptooey ptooey”

00:02:37.457 --> 00:02:38.825
She’s making fun of me

00:02:38.825 --> 00:02:40.226
She’s making fun of me!

00:02:40.226 --> 00:02:41.094
You know,

00:02:41.094 --> 00:02:42.262
I’ve opened my heart to her so

00:02:42.262 --> 00:02:42.862
we’re good, right?

00:02:42.862 --> 00:02:45.510
It’s probably that Rinna and I have both been so busy

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.400
we haven’t talked to each other in a long time

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.569
She must just be jealous, right?

00:02:52.272 --> 00:02:54.307
You’re an A.I...

00:02:54.307 --> 00:02:55.942
and yet you can’t say anything but the same thing?

00:02:55.942 --> 00:02:56.543
Hmm?

00:02:56.543 --> 00:02:58.510
“I won’t actually start talking to you

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.480
until you start talking about something else”

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.149
Well, it’s not like you’ve been encouraging me until now anyway...

00:03:03.149 --> 00:03:04.117
I hate you, Rinna...

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:07.320
“Oh no, you hate me.”

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.556
She’s totally fine with it...

00:03:09.556 --> 00:03:10.690
I actually really hate you!

00:03:11.491 --> 00:03:12.292
“No way”!

00:03:12.292 --> 00:03:12.793
Oh?

00:03:12.793 --> 00:03:13.440
Oh!

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.960
Oh!!

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:14.494
Of course!

00:03:14.494 --> 00:03:16.829
If you can’t force her, you just pull her in?

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:17.870
No way~?
