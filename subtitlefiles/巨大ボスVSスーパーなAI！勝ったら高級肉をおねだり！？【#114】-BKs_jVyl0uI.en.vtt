00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:01.880
Hello everyone! Good afternoon, I'm Kizuna Ai!

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:03.040
In this occasion...

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:04.740
I received requests from several entrepreneurs...

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.440
To present you with this app:

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:08.480
"Grand Summoners"

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:10.200
Abreviated as Grasama

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.220
Regarding this app...

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:14.140
even though they asked me to present it...

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:17.020
just presenting it normally that wouldn't be fun, so then...

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:20.180
I tried to ask the entrepreneurs something

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:21.260
Definitely...

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:25.140
In my case I would like to make an enjoyable video for you guys...

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.120
Saying that...

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.940
For today...

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:29.960
If I can finish successfully the quest that I'll try to complete..

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.640
I'm thinking of giving out a gift to all of you!

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.020
Well, I've been thinking a lot on what to give you guys

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:36.860
I've been thinking, but...

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:38.100
definitely...

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.040
the best gift is a summoning stone, right?

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.780
They probably might invite us to eat meat as they are very friendly directors

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:45.080
I'm sure there won't be a problem!

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:46.760
In that case, let's start right away!

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.960
For today, I'll try to attempt...

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.820
A quest that I've been told it's very difficult

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.380
The friendly directors...

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:01.660
They gave me a device that has a team that can complete the mission...

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:02.840
This giant boss called:

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:03.680
"The Crimson Champion"

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.140
In this mission, you don't have the option to continue

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:06.820
So then, it's extremely hard..

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.060
"Roar of the Fire Dragon - Extreme Level"

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.260
I think I'll attempt to complete it

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.300
The boss you have to defeat is a fire dragon known as "Deguru Magna"

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:19.880
I got prepared in advance a party and equipment powerful enough to be able to win

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:21.640
So then surely I can win

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:22.340
But...

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.780
Definitely as it about a challenge...

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.240
I'll try to be as fair as possible..

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.760
There exists the "Autoplay" option
(Play automatically)

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:30.500
If we're talking about an A.I..

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.860
We're definitely talking about me

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:33.500
Right?

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.300
Regardless, let's check the A.I's ability

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:38.860
Good, in this case, let's start right away!

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:40.900
I still have my doubts, so then...

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:42.480
I'll have to check it out..

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.020
Oooh!

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:45.820
Here...

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:47.140
Not only is it possible to use the "Autoplay" option...

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.800
But you can also configure a lot of options related to the "Autoplay" function

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.160
It's very...

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.380
great that it has the "Autoplay" option, right?

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.720
Ah! Ah! Incredible!

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:56.700
Eh? Eh? In an instant... Eh?

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:57.760
In an instant... Eh?

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:59.180
Aaah!

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.740
What you see below is the equipment

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.720
The equipment does not recover at all, right?

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.400
I see, the equipment should be chosen adecuately for each character

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.900
And when their face shines, does that mean the skill is ready to be used?

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:15.500
The skills are slowly reloading...

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.820
So I think it's best to use them immediately, right?

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:19.700
I see

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.740
This...

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:25.260
Yes, finding the right moment to use them is hard, right?

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:26.280
"Secret Technique"!

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.840
So then you have secret techniques?

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.180
Ah, it's great!

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.980
Incredible!

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.380
Eh? It's fun just to watch

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.900
Even though I'm not doing anything

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:38.060
Oh!

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.400
Everytime the level changes, the skills recover, right?

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:43.080
That means...

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.160
before the level changes...

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.460
If you accumulate all the skills, you should use them immediately

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.800
Let's go! Let's go!

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:50.900
Ah, this now...

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.300
This kind of magic that does "Paaa" is great!

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:56.980
I wonder if that kind of celestial sphere is...

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:58.760
Something that protects me

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.300
Ah! I already reached the boss?

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:01.600
Incredible!

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.780
Eh?

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:05.440
Eh? I'm in trouble

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:07.820
Ah! Ah! It's like I thought!

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:08.660
It's like as if...

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.680
it reduced...

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.120
the damage taken..

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.160
My HP didn't lower at all

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:15.720
My HP...

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:16.480
Surprising!

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:19.120
This green ability...

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.720
is called "The coat of arms of Fenrir"...

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:22.980
It must be for healing, right?

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:24.800
It looks good

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:26.120
"Break"!

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:27.120
Ah!

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:31.620
Ah, when you're in this state, the enemy can't attack

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:35.320
This way, I can attack freely, right?

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.920
Ah! Incredible! Incredible! Incredible! Incredible! Incredible!

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.200
The fire attack!

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:41.360
"Weak"! "Weak"!

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:42.540
Ooooh!

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.940
Good job!

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:44.900
Now it's decided...

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:48.180
After all, I have a lot of HP..

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:50.760
Aaaaahh! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:51.780
Ah!

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:53.320
Ah! The fire! The fire is...!

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.960
Ah!

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:57.160
When it accumulates five of those red balls...

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:01.320
It causes a very strong attack and it'll recover, right?

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:02.340
I see..

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.880
Now I'm understanding it..

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:07.920
That's right, now that an A.I can win

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:09.900
Now that you can win while in automatic mode

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:11.540
Probably...

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:15.240
Considering that I'm not just simply an A.I, but a super A.I..

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.180
I'm sure I can win..

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:18.260
Piece of cake

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.220
I'm not lying Mr. directors!

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:21.160
I'm playing it cleanly

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:23.220
This looks good, this...

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.700
Looks like the battle is reaching it's end, right?

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.880
This is a piece of cake, right?

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.880
Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:30.600
Ah!

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:31.800
It's great! This...!

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:33.380
This secret technique..

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:34.960
What's it called?

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:35.680
It's great!

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.680
Ah! Incredible! I really won!
*The automatic A.I won!*

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:43.480
Sorry for doubting you, game directors!

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:45.560
If the automatic A.I could win...

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.940
It's obvious that I'll also win, right?

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.960
Good, seeing how it's played, I know the trick to it..

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:51.120
So I guess I will do it

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:52.960
In order to do it perfectly...

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:54.820
I'll install a strategy guide

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:56.700
In order to be victorious!

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:57.700
.

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:58.620
..

00:04:58.620 --> 00:04:59.520
...

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:00.440
....

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:01.340
.....

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:02.120
Ready!

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:05.900
Now I have the strategy guide in here!

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:08.660
I understand now the equipment functions and members of the team!

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:10.140
Now I can do it

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:11.920
In this case, here I go!

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:14.300
I finally reached the boss!

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:17.260
Man, this is a piece of cake!

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:19.880
Ah, but I'm scared

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:23.780
The most important thing is utilizing the skills at all times

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:25.040
Good...

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:26.180
Here I go

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:27.700
This is really easy

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:31.460
Man, this feels like it was a piece of cake, right?

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:35.140
This is... then...

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:40.500
I didn't touch on the section of the desperate battles section of the strategy guide, but...

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:44.000
It's true, the music is also really beautiful, don't you think?

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:46.580
And the graphics are also really lovely

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:48.900
Eh? Ah! No! No! Wait a moment!

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:50.200
Wait, this is dangerous..

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:51.720
It's dangerous...

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:54.100
When I look away for a moment...

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:55.020
Ah

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:57.760
But these...

00:05:58.260 --> 00:05:59.360
Motion? Motion?

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:01.120
The movements are also really lovely, so then...

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:02.740
For the moment...

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:05.120
Although I'm pressing without understanding everything...

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:06.900
It's fun in a way, right?

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:08.100
This is great!

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:09.580
Ah, this is great

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:11.080
Ah, these... these... you know...

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:11.860
These...

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:13.680
balls you're gathering are dangerous..

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:15.100
When you gather them and you're in trouble...

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:17.840
This way, you can reduce the damage taken

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:19.500
Ah, but I'm really in trouble

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:20.380
Ah, I should stop talking...

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:21.080
AAAAHH!

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:22.020
Wait a moment!

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:22.760
Ah!

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:23.620
Wait a moment!

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:25.680
Really, it's dangerous if I don't take this seriously

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:26.540
It's really dangerous..

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:27.800
Dangerous..

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:29.120
Wait!

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:30.680
Wait!

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.040
It's like an early death

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:34.760
Wait! Ah! *mumbling* Go for it..

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:37.680
Go for it, go for it, good job, go for it..

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:39.540
Eh? Wait a moment!

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:40.160
Wait! Wait! Wait!

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:43.240
Listen, do it for everyone, please

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:44.960
Please... really...

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.100
Aaah! Aaaahh!

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:46.780
*inhales*

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:47.740
Noooooo!

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:49.340
Really, just a bit more

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:51.260
Ah, just... here it comes... here it comes

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:52.780
Ah, I'm in trouble! In trouble! In trouble!

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:55.400
In trouble! In trouble! In trouble!

00:06:55.940 --> 00:07:01.360
In troubleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:03.420
In trouble!

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:04.480
In trouble

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:05.240
Eh? This is...

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:06.100
This is a little...

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:08.820
Now's not the time to make jokes

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:12.540
It wasn't the time to go imitating Youtubers

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:15.960
Do you know who I was imitating?

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:18.080
Ah, I'm in trouble!

00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:18.820
This skill...

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:20.360
of Fenrir..

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:22.160
Then...

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:22.920
Aaaah!

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:23.620
The enemy is...!

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:24.820
Then...

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:25.660
This is...

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:27.160
This is...

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:28.180
reducing...

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:30.100
the damage...

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:33.000
Thanks to the skill..

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.160
Thanks to the skill..

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:36.480
Now that my enemy is...

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:38.300
really powerful..

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:39.720
I should...

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:40.620
use it...

00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:42.520
when it attacks me with ferocity..

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.260
This is the best way, right?

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:47.060
Ah, I'm really in trouble, it gathered the five balls again..

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:49.500
Ah! I'm in troubleeeeee!

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:52.700
I still can't use the "Fenrir" skill to protect myself

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:54.620
I'm really in trouble

00:07:56.220 --> 00:07:56.960
I'll use it!

00:07:57.540 --> 00:07:58.320
Aaah!

00:07:58.320 --> 00:07:59.280
Wait a moment..

00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:02.040
Really I can't...

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:02.860
Everyone do it...

00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:04.700
Everyone do it with me!

00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:06.700
I'm in trouble

00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:08.400
I want to eat meat

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:10.180
Hey Fenrir-san...

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:11.140
Hey...

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:12.380
Please!

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:13.340
Then...

00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:15.040
Then...

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:18.880
This skill called "The I don't know what of Fenrir", it's not that I can't read it because I don't know the kanji

00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:19.780
Ah!

00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:20.760
It looks like I can win it fairly!

00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:22.600
Will I be able to win?

00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:23.540
Do your best!

00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:24.980
Please!

00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:26.680
Ah! Break! Break! I can do it!

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:27.940
I can do it!

00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:29.220
I can do it, but...

00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:30.300
I've got it, Kudou!

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:32.400
I'm mixing a lot of things, Kudou!

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:33.600
Good! Good!

00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:34.800
Yeaaah!

00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:36.500
I've got it, Kurodou!

00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:38.500
I've got it, Kudou!

00:08:39.180 --> 00:08:40.240
Yeah!

00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:41.760
I wooooon!

00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:43.360
I won, everyone!

00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:44.820
Well, you know...

00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:48.860
...this was a piece of cake for a Super A.I. like me.

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:52.480
Now I will go ask them give us a summoning stone!

00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:53.640
¡Yeeeeey!

00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:54.720
* Clap clap *

00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:57.160
Ah, hello, thank you for working with me.

00:08:57.160 --> 00:09:00.920
I'm Virtual YouTuber Kizuna AI.

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:02.620
Ah, I'm Shinaga from Next Ninja.

00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:04.320
Ah, thank you for working with me!

00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:07.380
I've just finished my video.

00:09:07.420 --> 00:09:09.960
And I'd like to report something.

00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:11.400
Do you have time now?

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:11.960
What's it?

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:12.480
Ah!

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:14.000
Thank you very much!

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.060
To tell you the truth...

00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:18.720
I've successfully finished the extreme difficulty level!

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:19.940
Oh! Were you able to win it?

00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:20.440
Yes!

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:20.940
Congratulations.

00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:22.120
Thank you very much!

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:23.220
So, you know...

00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:24.640
now that I won...

00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:26.760
I'd like to request something very important from you...

00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:31.100
I was thinking if it would be possible to give...

00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:35.860
...everyone playing this game a summoning stone.

00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:37.740
That's what I was thinking

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:40.020
I'll check it with Yamagishi

00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:41.880
Ah, yes, thank you very much!

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:43.000
Please wait a moment.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:43.520
Yes!

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:44.940
Hello

00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:46.800
Ah, yes, hello!

00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:49.620
Ah, I've just checked with Yamagishi...

00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:50.460
Ah, yes!

00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:51.080
Well...

00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:51.580
Yes!

00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:53.340
if you, Kizuna AI-san

00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:53.840
Yes!

00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:55.100
Work hard and do your best

00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:55.600
Yes!

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:56.760
We will seriously think about it

00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:57.260
I see!

00:09:57.700 --> 00:09:58.580
I understand!

00:09:58.580 --> 00:09:59.560
Thank you very much!

00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:01.300
Yes, please do your best from now on!

00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:01.800
I will!

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:05.920
After all, If I do my best I'll receive lots of summoning stones, right?

00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:06.460
Yes!

00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:06.960
Ah!

00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:08.980
Thank you very much! You're very nice!

00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:10.200
In that case, starting from today...

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:11.580
Did you enjoy the game?

00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:13.660
Ah, yes! It was lots of fun!

00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:15.280
Animations were very pretty.

00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:16.980
And the music was incredible!

00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:18.200
It made me feel very nice.

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:19.840
It made me sleepy.

00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:22.240
Ok, please do your best!

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:23.700
Yes! Thank you very much!

00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:24.440
Goodbye!

00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:25.480
Goodbye!

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:27.140
Everyone!

00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:28.880
I'm very sorry!

00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:33.100
But if I keep doing my best like this...

00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:35.960
They will consider giving me a present.

00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:39.020
So I'll do my best from now on!

00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:40.080
So...

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:42.340
Even if I didn't receive a summoning stone.

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:45.120
I will be giving you a present!

00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:49.420
I'll be giving you the Gurasama secret technique wind animation.

00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:51.160
To participate in this giveaway...

00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:54.380
You will have to install "Grand Summoners"

00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:57.500
And then from the home menu

00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:01.020
Please play the quests for these giant bosses

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:03.460
Doesn't matter if you win or lose

00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:05.860
Just take a screenshot while playing...

00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:13.560
And send it to me by replying on Twitter with the hashtag #クラサマ #KizunaAI

00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:16.040
There will be three winners!

00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:17.660
Who will receive this present!

00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:23.100
Time limit is June 5th 12 AM, Japan timezone.

00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:24.320
So please bear that in mind!

00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:29.480
By the way, starting from June 3rd a commercial video will be broadcasted

00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:31.220
So please make sure to check it!

00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:33.560
By the way, speaking of June...

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:35.620
That's the month of my birthday so...

00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:37.440
even if it's just a joke...

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:39.400
This time...

00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:45.380
I've received a device with a powerful team from the game creators to experience the game

00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:50.680
Thanks to that I was able to enjoy the game and understand the basics

00:11:50.740 --> 00:11:53.960
But next time I plan on using my own device and become more powerful

00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:56.200
To be able to play multi-battles with everyone

00:11:56.340 --> 00:11:58.960
This was Virtual YouTuber Kizuna AI!

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.120
See you guys next time!
