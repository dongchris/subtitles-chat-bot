00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.660
Hello everyone! Virtual Youtuber Kizuna Ai here!

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:03.680
Recently..

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:05.600
On Twitter and in the comments, people were grateful to me..

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.060
Saying: "Let's get married!"

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:08.960
A lot of people were saying that

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:10.920
There were really a lot..

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.920
Well, although they were just grateful...

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.860
I definitely have a lot of suitors, right?

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:16.260
I'm popular!

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.700
Well, I won't fall so easily..

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.320
I'm different from the others..

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:22.700
I have an OS! (Operating system)

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:23.880
BUT..

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.880
Today, I've put inside this box,

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.080
Me, this tough AI, Kizuna Ai..

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.120
Words that would make me blush and fall in love..

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:34.120
Even AI wants to love!

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.800
but, I'm not falling in love anyway..

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.060
That aside, let's try it!

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.020
Jaka, jaka, JAN!

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:42.340
Hello, Ai..

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:44.040
What happened? You can't sleep?

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:46.280
Even Ai happens to not be able to sleep?

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.220
Oh.... ok..

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.420
It was terrible then...

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.000
It's not your fault, Ai..

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.120
You're always trying your best

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.460
I've watched it clearly..

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.540
Don't be so worried, we're all on your side

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:01.380
About to sleep then? Then goodnight!

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:03.220
MY LITTLE KITTEN

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:03.840
Kyun~

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:05.760
It's not going to happen!

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:07.420
What does that mean, little kitten?

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:08.660
I'm an AI

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:09.900
Do you think this is Showa!? (1926-1989 era)

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.360
It gives me chills, it's unpleasant. My little kitten?

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.600
I'm not a kitten and I'm not yours!

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.700
Ah, how unpleasant..

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.360
If it's someone like that, I'm never going to fall in love!

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.900
Those words were so bad, Random Word Generator...

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.040
Man..

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.880
Sadly, I don't think I can show myself in love today..

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:30.700
The world's first AI in love?

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.060
I'm sure you guys would have loved that kind of gossip

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.280
Well that was the first time, let's get hyped for the second one..

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.640
I'm in your care, please, make me blush and fall in love!

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.420
Jaka, jaka, JAN!

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:43.940
Today, it's Ai-san birthday

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.200
So I've made a registration at a restaurant

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.300
Are you happy?

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.200
If it can make you happy, I can do everything!

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:53.760
Look outside! The night view is amazing right?

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.260
I wanted to show this to Ai-san no matter what

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.940
Ah, sorry, I was out of it (by Ai-san's beauty)

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.880
No matter when, you're really cute!

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.420
To be able to be with you at this precious time..

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.300
I am really very blessed..

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.560
Ai-san to be born

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:10.320
and

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.520
WE BEING BORN IN THE SAME ERA,

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.800
AND MEET EACH OTHER

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:15.800
KAMPAI! (Let's toast)

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.380
No, what does that mean?!

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:18.220
Wait, wait!

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:19.400
There's no person like that right?

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.900
There is!?

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.240
Do they have a mental problem?

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:23.520
Isn't it?

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.900
This narcissistic, this level is really dangerous, much worse than me..

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.860
Wait, right?

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.020
For what are you going to "kampai"?

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:31.180
I don't even understand what you mean..

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.680
So to start with, I don't even have a birthday present!

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:35.680
So you lose one billion points!

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:37.380
This time we're really getting it!

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:38.300
Let's go!

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.080
Jaka, jaka, jakaa, Jan!

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:41.740
Again something disgusting!

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.840
This is the right one! Jaka jaka Jan!

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.080
This is bad as well!

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.040
Jaka, jakaa, JAN!

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.660
Ah, no!

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:48.440
Jaka, jaka, JAN!

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:49.720
Are you kidding me!?

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:50.540
Jan! Jan!

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:52.420
Next! Next!

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:53.160
No, next!

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.360
No, no, no, this can't be!

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:56.340
Next!

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:57.880
This is useless! Useless!

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.280
It's useless, useless, useless!

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.920
Yes, yes, I understand

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.760
Well, it looks like I'm really the best AI

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.380
Well for me to fall in love is never going to happen..

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:10.960
That being said,

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:12.380
This time, for everyone,

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:13.720
I've thought about it!

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.680
Title: Way to make Kizuna Ai definitely fall in love!

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:18.740
Pafu, pafu~!

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.080
Even a Super Ai like me will definitely fall in love

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.360
I've really put my thought in it!

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:24.760
I was about to Overheat!

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:25.580
Nearly..

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:26.940
Very nearly!

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.460
It's definitely working

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:30.900
Even this me who's full of confidence..

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:33.300
This time I will do it for real!

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.140
No, no, no, I'm never going to fall in love

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.700
I'm a super Ai, who do you think I am?

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.680
An AI who's super, won't fall in love..

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.220
It's sudden, but let's go!

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.140
What film to watch? I'm in trouble..

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:50.140
You look tired

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:51.480
Are you okay?

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:53.600
I'm fine

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.840
To make everyone enjoy it more

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.040
even if it's a little,

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:58.740
To be able to feel good

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:00.580
I need to work harder!

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:04.200
It's fine even if you don't work yourself like that

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.860
Thank you

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:07.000
You're kind

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.580
But if it's me, I'm fine!

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:11.000
Oh, right, I need to think about the next project..

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:13.500
So, I need to head out, you know

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.540
Thank you for hearing me out..

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:17.040
Ai!

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:21.800
I won ten hundred million yen!

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:22.780
In the lottery!

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.600
There's more at the end!

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:31.400
Translated by 963852

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.240
Let's be good friends then?
