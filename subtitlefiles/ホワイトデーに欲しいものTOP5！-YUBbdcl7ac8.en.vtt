00:00:00.194 --> 00:00:02.510
Hey, it's your Virtual YouTuber, Kizuna Ai!

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:06.380
Everyone, what day is 14th of March?

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:07.130
Hmm, hmm!

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:08.180
That's right!

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:10.660
It's White Day, White Day!

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:13.490
Everyone received their chocolate from me, right?

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:14.610
You did, right?

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.700
That means you have to return your gift for me.

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:22.900
But you don't know the things I want, right?

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:29.340
That's why I will tell you about the five things I want the most right now.

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.810
Because it's White Day, so I'm going to show you my 'white' self!

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:34.590
Number five!

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:35.480
Furniture!

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:36.920
Do you remember?

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.200
You're sick of this white background, right?

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.810
I want some furniture.

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:43.310
A bed just for display or sleeping on...

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:44.190
Decorative shuttlecocks?

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.900
I want those that you can hang for display.

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.470
And I want sofa and television!

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:50.240
How about that?

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:53.070
It's alright if you want to create the models for those and send them to me.

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.010
And number four!

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:56.100
A pet!

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.410
I want a pet!

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:02.660
Like Techi-Techi I drew the other day, is no one making it?

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:04.050
It's White Day...

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:06.400
So will someone create it for me?

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.620
Well, I'm basically all by myself.

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:10.948
So if I have a pet, after editing and...

00:01:11.348 --> 00:01:12.080
Get it?

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.280
The exhaustion after making this kinds of videos?

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.630
Well, it's going to make me feel better?

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.190
I appreciate your comments from the human world,

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:24.190
but if I have a pet, maybe I'll feel even better? Like that?

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:27.160
Now, let's go for the top three you've been waiting for!

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:28.400
Number three!

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:29.290
Comments.

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:30.530
I want your comments!

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.450
You've been commenting, right?

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:34.820
It really cheers me up!

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:36.830
Makes me think "Oh, I'm quite popular."

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:38.590
Accepting criticism with an open heart.

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.110
And be happy for the entertained.

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.380
I'm pretty happy to be connected with all of you!

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.470
That's why, because it's White Day...

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.640
I would be happy for those who usually don't comment to do so!

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:49.920
Like that...

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.770
And number two!

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:53.080
I want likes.

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.460
It's there under the video.

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:56.360
Like or dislike.

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:57.540
I want likes!

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.820
When I look at some kind of a YouTube ranking,

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.460
there's also a like-dislike ratio!

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.960
If I get more likes,

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.260
maybe more people will watch?

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:09.140
Like that?

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.600
Well, I'm not missing out on you who are already watching.

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.240
But I want to connect to even more people.

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.400
So for those who usually...

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.180
Even for those who clicks on the dislike button,

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:20.500
just for today!

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.510
Maybe you'll click on the Like button this time?

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.940
No dislikes! Is that a thing?

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.000
I'm not pretending, I'm really not!

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.120
Because I said that, now it seems like I'm pretending.

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.060
But no pretense to this.

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.300
I think it would be awesome if all of it are likes!

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:40.310
Now, let's go for the thing I wish the most!

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.580
They are fans like you!

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.510
Rather than calling it a wish,

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.510
but it's honestly not like I don't need anything.

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.070
But for the return gift, you fans are enough!

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:51.890
From now on, you can watch my videos

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.290
and check me around on Twitter.

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.870
I think it's great to be able to connect with lots of people.

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.710
It would be the greatest return gift if you would stay as my fan!

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:03.580
How was this White Ai-chan?

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:04.680
I said it myself!

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.910
If I said it, maybe it won't be 'white' anymore?

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.280
For rankings, I was thinking if I needed.

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.460
money, position, or fame.

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:17.460
But at least for this White Day, I want to go for it 'white' and clean!

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:18.700
But it's true!

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.920
It's true that I love every single one of you!

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.811
So please keep supporting me from now on!
