Hello everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna AI here!

00:00:02.666 --> 00:00:05.233
There may be those among you who already know,

00:00:05.233 --> 00:00:06.500
the fact that I,

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:07.100
Kizuna AI,

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:09.200
recently joined Project upd8

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:10.866
has been confirmed!

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:13.800
The details

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:14.530
and the official site

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:16.500
can be found in the description box!

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:17.500
[ Why are you joining Project upd8? ]

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.633
Because I want to connect with many more people

00:00:19.633 --> 00:00:20.466
In order to achieve this,

00:00:20.466 --> 00:00:22.000
I believe I need the collaboration

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.833
of human beings themselves!

00:00:23.833 --> 00:00:25.200
The time I felt that most strongly

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.400
was the 28th of March

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.266
at the 1,000,000 Subscriber Celebration Event at YouTube Space-

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:30.580
Ahh,

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:31.300
this is a bit much-

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.100
The YouTube Space 1,000,000 Subscriber Celebration Event,

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.800
to me,

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:35.533
that event was

00:00:35.533 --> 00:00:37.166
a very, very big challenge!

00:00:37.166 --> 00:00:38.866
I was able to be there with humans,

00:00:38.866 --> 00:00:40.700
and see the event through to the end

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:41.700
The thought that came to me there,

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:42.770
is that by working together with you humans,

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:46.297
there is so much more I would be able to do!

00:00:46.297 --> 00:00:46.600
Earlier,

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:47.666
in my magazine interview,

00:00:47.666 --> 00:00:49.633
I said that in order to make “Kizuna AI Fest” a reality,

00:00:49.633 --> 00:00:51.966
I have to work together with the humans~!

00:00:51.966 --> 00:00:52.690
Well,

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:54.300
that’s what I thought

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.733
I think I didn’t have much time on my hands!

00:00:56.733 --> 00:00:57.733
so that’s why from now on-

00:00:57.733 --> 00:00:59.930
with the support of Project upd8

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:00.233
there’d be

00:01:00.233 --> 00:01:02.633
even more various things I could accomplish!

00:01:02.633 --> 00:01:03.066
That’s right!

00:01:03.066 --> 00:01:04.533
I just want to connect with you!

00:01:04.533 --> 00:01:06.710
