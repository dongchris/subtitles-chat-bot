00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:09.460
[dejectedly] Hi...

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:11.220
My god, what happened to you?

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:13.260
Did you do that bad on your ochem midterm?

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:16.840
I broke up with Jeungri

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:17.860
[all] WHAT??

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:19.460
What are you thinking?!

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:21.680
Girl, are you CRAZY?

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.340
Wait- what's the big deal?

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:24.760
Why are you guys getting mad at her?

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.440
Her boyfriend-- now EX-boyfriend

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.260
was a K-pop star!

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.820
*gasps* FROM WHICH BAND?

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.120
EXO? GOT7? Super Junior? Big Bang?

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:36.600
Actually

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:39.360
From BgA

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.640
Girl. Are you CRAZY?

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.560
Guys, you DON'T understand!

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:48.880
We understand that you were literally living the dream

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.200
of a BILLION girls out there

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:52.460
I know...

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.560
I'm just as big of a k-pop fan as you are

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:56.620
and based on everything that we watch and listen to

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.020
dating a k-pop star is like winning the lottery...

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:01.040
but... i-it's not what you think

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.000
What do you mean it's not what we think??

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.200
Well, for starters, there's the dancing...

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.260
OMG. It is SOOO hot when they dance

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.120
but it neeever stops

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.360
[crowd chanting] JEUNGRI! JEUNGRI! JEUNGRI!

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.120
um, hey, so can we go now?

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.340
just one more song- one more song!

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.740
OK, cause, uh, I think the DJ was done playing like

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:38.880
two songs ago??

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.040
And then, there's his wardrobe...

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.040
The outfits are the BEST PART!

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.000
Isn't this beautiful, Jeungri?

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.940
... Jeungri?

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.040
Wha- can you just- HEY!

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.300
just leave the hat there...

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:00.000
uhhm

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.140
your... thigh chain is....?

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:05.220
how did you...

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:10.580
*pssh* so his style gets in the way sometimes

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.520
that's NOT enough to break up!

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.260
uhm, can I- can I get my powder back?

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:20.640
I'm almost done ^^

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.020
o-okay

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.040
It's... um... you're just kinda... using a lot

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.300
Hey, can you run with me to get milk at the store later?

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.560
Why drink milk, when we can have...

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:33.580
MUKIS!!!

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:35.680
Carbonated drink drink!

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:37.880
So cool, and naked!

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:44.960
[speaking korean]

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.280
[in korean] I love you, Mukis!

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.860
Uh, is everything you touch a product placement?

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.100
Who are you even talking to?

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:54.860
Ah we're going to be late!

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:56.800
Agh, we're gonna lose our reservation

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.880
[dramatic sappy music]

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:22.600
can you WALK at a normal speed for ONCE?

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.200
We're already late!

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.400
Wow. That DOES sound pretty annoying.

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:38.420
What was the final straw?

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:45.500
So how was your day?

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:47.160
It was-

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.820
Sorry, who is she again?

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:51.100
Huh?

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:53.600
Oh, this is just my pretend wife!

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:56.240
[in korean] Hello, I'm Hyuna!

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:58.680
We're pretending to be married for a month for a TV show!

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:02.100
yeeaaaah... I-I don't think I'm comfortable with this

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.200
It's just pretend, my dear

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.740
[in korean] it's just fake!

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:07.100
Here- have some more food!

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:24.200
ENOUGH!

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:25.940
I can't take this anymore!

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:27.120
I'm sorry Jeungri

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:30.380
you are the k-pop guy of my dreams

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:33.180
but not the guy for me in real life!

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:35.260
I have to end this

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:36.680
Amanda!

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:43.460
[dramatic sappy music playing] Noooooooooooooooo

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:49.700
yeeah... okay bye!

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:02.240
I'm sorry girl

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:03.640
you made the right choice

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:06.120
Yeah, a tough one, but the right one

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.380
What do you think he's gonna do now?

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:12.120
I'm not sure...

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:15.840
I'm sorry, Jeungri

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:16.880
You'll be alright

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:18.920
Yeah, she doesn't know what she's missing, man

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:20.940
You know what would make you feel better?

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:24.500
[all] MUKIS!

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:40.820
