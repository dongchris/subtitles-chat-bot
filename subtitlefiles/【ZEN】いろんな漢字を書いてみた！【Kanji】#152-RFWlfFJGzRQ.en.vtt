00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.960
Hello everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai here!

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.140
Everyone, have you heard of 'Kanji'?

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:08.240
Anyway, in Japan...

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.060
Over 5000 Kanji are used in day to day life!

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:12.200
Did you know that?!

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.100
So, for this video, I'll use this app called 'Zen Brush'...

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:17.200
And I thought I'd like to teach you all some Kanji!

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.260
This is unnecessary for me to study, really...

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:20.580
I am an A.I after all!

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:22.180
Well then, let's give it a try!

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:23.760
Random word generator...

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.120
COME ONNNNNN!

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:26.560
Jaka, jaka, jakaa...

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:27.140
JAN!

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.820
Ooohh!

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:28.500
Sakura! 
(Cherry Tree/Blossom)

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:30.780
That's nice, isn't it? Spring! So pretty...

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:31.940
Although it's summer right now...

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:33.400
Well, let's give this a try!

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:34.300
First goes...  Here!

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:35.980
And then... Here!

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:37.160
Oooohhh!

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:37.980
This is fun!

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:39.360
And then it goes... Here!

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:40.600
And next... Here!

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:41.520
And then... *pew*

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:42.240
Woah, I'm good!

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:43.000
*pew*

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:44.500
And now... *pew*!

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:45.080
Hmm...

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.800
Now.. *whoosh*!

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:47.860
*whoosh, whoosh*

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.160
It's kind of messy, isn't it…?

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.300
And now... Here!

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:51.240
How is it?!

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.320
This is kind of like my character - I’m pretty much pink...

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:56.340
I give a ‘Sakura’ feeling, don’t I?

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:57.240
Okay! Onto the next one!

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:58.320
Jaka, jaka, jakaa...

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:58.940
Ja, jan!

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.640
'Samurai'!
(Japanese Swordsman)

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.220
The Japanese Samurai, right?

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:02.400
Right, let's go!

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:03.660
This goes... Here!

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:04.460
It's messy, isn't it?

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:05.940
And this goes... Here...

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.840
And then... Huh? Where do I start?

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:08.500
Do I start here?

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:09.680
And... Here!

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.280
Then... Here!

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:13.720
Then here! Here, right?

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.780
And then, you write another stroke...

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:18.360
Here... Here!

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:19.800
It's so messy...

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:21.660
And then here, you go like this, right?

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.220
The balance is bad for this character...

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.760
Well if I wrote it, you can see I tried and that makes it pretty, right?

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:29.420
Ok, next!

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:30.620
Jaka, jaka, jakaa...

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:31.240
JAN!

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:32.560
Oh! 'Dekoboko'!
(Rough/Uneven)

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.440
This one... I don't know the stroke order for it...

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:36.660
Right, well then, let's try it!

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:38.900
Eh? How did the stroke order go... Here?

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:40.040
Next... Here?

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:41.420
Then... *pew*!

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:42.600
From here... *pew*!

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:43.680
And from here... *laughs*

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.800
*pew, pew, pew*!

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.900
Messy...

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:48.140
And then, here...

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.640
Here, from there, here, from there, here, here...

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:52.880
And here, right?

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:53.420
Mmm?

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:54.240
The stroke order....

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.280
Is correct...?

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:57.780
You didn't know the stroke order?
“(x) The stroke order is not correct”

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.400
You must be an idiot!
“(x) The stroke order is not correct”

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:00.240
Really...

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.740
Kanji really are hard, right?

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:02.640
Okay, next!

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:03.920
Jaka, jaka, jakaa, JAN!

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.600
Oh! This is my name!

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:07.660
Kizuna Ai!

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:09.540
It's a little bit challenging, but let's do this!

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:13.660
Kizuna is like, this, that, and there...

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:19.260
*cute Ai noises*

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:20.480
And...

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.980
*pew*

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.340
And there, from there, like this...

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:24.640
Love is... There!

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.520
That's good enough! Yeah, good enough...

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.240
I mean, it is my writing, right?

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.680
This is written like that...

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:32.940
I'll write the kanji for "kokoro".
(kokoro = heart)

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.080
*pew, pew, pew*

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.980
And...!

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:36.480
*ominous laughter*

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:38.440
Yes! Here it is!

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:39.160
Ja, ja, jan!

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.780
"Kizuna" means to bond in Japanese...

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.140
Seems like “bonding”, right?!

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.040
And "ai" is “love”, it means I love you!

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.200
So by now, I'm sure everyone...

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.160
Is starting to understand Kanji more!

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:52.320
Okay, the last one!

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.320
Jaka, jaka, jakaa, JAN!

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:55.080
Hahaha...

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.200
Look, it's your name! "Shachiku"

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.920
Yes!

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.640
*strange Ai noises*

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:05.420
Oh! It looks a little bit like it! Looking good!

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:09.400
*more Ai-chan noises*

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:11.520
Ah! This dot looks cool...

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:15.460
What? The proportions are kind of trash... They're really bad...

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:18.660
Well, fixing the proportions from here takes skill...

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:19.200
*pew*

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:20.300
Like this...

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.400
And like this, and there!

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.880
I wonder why the proportions... Are so unbalanced?

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.320
Okay! I've finished!

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.220
I was able to write everybody's name!

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.800
"Shachiku"! These are people who are owned by their companies like slaves...

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.300
Basically, you're like livestock.

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.960
Try your best!

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:36.800
And now...

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.780
From here on, I'll be moving onto an extremely challenging Kanji!

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.140
Ja-jan! This one!

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:42.740
Am I able to write this?!

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:45.000
Well, writing this out is pretty much like an impossible game...

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.860
But you know, I am a super A.I...

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:48.600
So I can do anything if I feel like it!

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.120
So, I'll try my best!

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.960
Here I come!

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:53.220
I'll do this like, this!

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.160
And I'll do this like that!

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.620
And... *pew, pew, pew*...

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:58.560
*pew*

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.920
There!

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:01.840
Like this... Like this... Like this...

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:03.360
And then, it's like this~

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:04.820
This somehow looks like an ancient character...

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:05.760
And then...

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:07.680
This... And this... Like this...

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:08.460
Followed by this...

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:10.380
What's important here, is its unique feeling...

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:12.560
Then it's like this... *laughs*

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:14.580
And then, here...

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:18.260
You do this, like that, and that, there and here!

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:19.940
And then...

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:21.220
Like this!

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.300
Do it like this, here and there...

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:27.780
*Ai-chan drawing sounds*

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:29.340
And here too, like this...

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:30.920
*pew, pew, pew, pew, pew*

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:34.940
*Shu, shu, shu, shu, Fashion, shun, shun*

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:37.300
And now, there's two ''Dragon''

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:38.660
Like this... Here's this!

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:39.960
And... It’s like this!

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:41.800
And here's like this...

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:42.780
*shun, shun*

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:46.680
Also, there's (陰線) here, so you need to do it like this...

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:47.720
You know...

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:49.980
Those lanes, you need to use them fully...

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:51.600
And here's also like this...

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.360
*chipan, chipan, PAN!*

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:55.180
And like this! Like that!

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:56.000
*Pash, PAN!*

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.400
Then it's like this...

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:58.900
And like this... *shun*

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:00.160
*shun, shun, shun*

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:01.320
Here's the last line!

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:01.820
*shun*!

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.020
Ha! Don't you see the effects?

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:05.280
*pew, pew*!

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:08.380
What do you think? It looks good right?

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:11.680
Just there... shouldn't I write Kizuna Ai in kanji once more?

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:12.880
Like this...

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:17.660
*Ai writing noises*

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:18.940
And then!

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:21.540
*more Ai noises*

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:22.640
It's about the heart...

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:23.680
*sha!*

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:24.740
How's that?!

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:25.740
It's perfect!

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:26.800
This...

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:28.160
I wonder for how much I can sell it...

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:29.260
Should I put it on auction?

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:32.840
After all, this is drawn by the artist Kizuna Ai, so...

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:35.800
The number I can send is very limited...

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:37.520
This will definitely make those who study calligraphy angry..

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:40.820
By the way, it seems that it’s spelt as ''Taito''

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:43.880
People says that it's used for naming...

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:45.660
But in fact, it's still a mystery...

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:49.160
Maan, Kanji’s great! They're amusing and cool!

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:51.200
Should I learn calligraphy?

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:53.360
After all, I think I have a good sense about it...

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:57.160
What about becoming a calligraphy artist?

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:00.540
Hello everyone! Virtual Calligraphist Kizuna Ai here!

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:01.480
Something like that!

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:03.220
Ok! Back on topic, for the end...

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:05.900
I think I'm going to write my favourite quote...

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:08.640
What do you think it is? Take a guess...

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:10.880
Here we go! Here... like this!

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:12.020
Like this and here...

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:13.060
And this!

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:15.140
Like this and this!

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:16.000
*sho*

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:17.040
And then...

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:18.160
Here... like this!

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:20.120
Then it's here...

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:22.000
Like this...

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:23.240
And like this!

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:32.740
*Ai writing noises*

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:34.360
Only the ''sei(生)'' looks kind of good!

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:35.620
I DID IT!

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:37.580
By the way, here's more like that...

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:38.800
Here also!

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:40.600
Second writing never annoys me...

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:43.740
That aside, my favorite compound kanji is...

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:45.260
“One Million Views”

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.160
That's my aim! Let's work hard!

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:48.560
Oooh!

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:49.580
And with that...

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:51.700
This was the Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai!

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:52.660
See you later!

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:55.180
There’s more at the end!

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:57.380
Translated by Mitsukitten, Thatsillogical, 963852 and Vortex

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:06.820
Well, that was perfect
