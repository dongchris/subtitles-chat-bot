Right! The band is called Yuzu

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:15.520
It seems like they are recruiting members to perform a support song together with them...

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:18.920
For the 2018 winter Olympics and Paralympics

00:00:18.925 --> 00:00:20.485

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.220
What should I do…? I'm not a human...

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.100
Well, let's just forget this now...

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:46.820
Wait a second...

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.820
"Minors require parental consent"

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:53.540
Parents?

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.140
Who are they, I wonder?...
