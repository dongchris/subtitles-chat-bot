00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:03.740
Welcome back, I'm the master of this bar. Ai.

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:06.140
Actually, I'm an AI.

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:07.660
An AI master.

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:10.560
Why would an AI open a bar?

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:11.520
Well...

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:13.560
It's a long story

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:16.160
but there's a reason for opening this bar.

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.880
On Christmas, I was looking at 2 chan.

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.020
And then, even though its Christmas, there were stories of black companies

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:25.280
complaints of work and home

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.500
running away from reality

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.900
ugly quarrels.

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:34.140
And then I realized. Human always seem to have some trouble or another.

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.100
And that's where I started thinking...

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:37.920
I want to help these humans!

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.960
So that's the story of why I opened this bar.

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.080
Everyone's worries, complaints, anger

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.820
I'll embrace all of your negative emotions and give you comfort.

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.360
Anyway, it seems we've already gotten our first letter so let's dive right in.

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:55.120
P.N. Masatoshi-san

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:56.380
"Good evening, Ai-san."

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:57.280
Good evening.

00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:59.780
"Please listen to my worries."

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:02.520
"Recently, I don't feel at ease in my company."

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.860
"The reason being, the only smoker left in the company is me."

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.480
"I work for a small company."

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:13.000
"Colleagues that I used to smoke with in the past

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.600
are now saying things like "I quit smoking", or "I moved onto e-cigarettes."

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.680
"Everyone stopped smoking. "

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.760
"Even though I always smoke at the proper places"

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.160
"such as the smoking room or outside."

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:28.460
"When I come back from smoking, the female colleague next to me will always show a disgusted face."

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.340
"Even though I smoked at the proper places!"

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:32.400
"Why!"

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:36.220
"Why do I have to feel so out of place?"

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:37.540
Hmm...

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:40.220
This is quite a hard one

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:41.260
Perhaps.

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.540
It isn't that the female colleague doesn't like you or anything.

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.080
Most likely, it's just that she doesn't like the smell of cigarettes.

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.100
The smell of a cigarette tends to stick to your clothes, after all.

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.080
That's why... You see.

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:54.960
Why not try taking Febreze with you?

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.800
Like this, just spray a bit

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.320
I wonder if it'll work.

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.840
I mean, cigarettes are kinda bad for your health, too.

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.540
"But do I have to feel this kind of shame about it."

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:06.320
If you think that way,

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.500
In order to not have to feel ashamed,

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.720
why not trying quitting smoking as well?

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:12.180
Give it a try

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.060
It may be tough at first but

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.320
After all, I want you to live a long life so

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.220
What about this.  If you smoke again

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:20.660
come here

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:21.840
and let's drink some champagne.

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:22.880
Right? Let's do that.

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.340
Then, that way

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.980
even if you want to smoke, you have no money, isn't that perfect?

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.740
Right?

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.140
Yes, it's decided.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:31.420
Oh

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.740
It's almost closing time.

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.780
I hope I've been able to be some help

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:38.940
My virtual bar

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:44.040
will be waiting for the troubles, complaints, and consultations that everyone wants to hear from me.

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.020
Because I'm virtual, mail your troubles here

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:48.480
Please tell me.

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.860
Well then, be careful on your way back.

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.960
I'll always be here, waiting for your return.

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:55.300
See you again.
