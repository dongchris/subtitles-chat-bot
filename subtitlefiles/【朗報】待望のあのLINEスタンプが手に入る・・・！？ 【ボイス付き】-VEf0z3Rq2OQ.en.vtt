Hello everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna AI here!

00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:03.680
In November last year

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:06.320
My official voiced LINE stamps were released

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:09.260
And thanks to you guys, it has a lot of users!

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:10.640
Thank you very much!!

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:12.580
And so, although this is a bit sudden

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:15.460
There's been reviews by the people who downloaded it

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:16.580
So I'm going to introduce them!

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:17.200
Here you go!

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.300
At work, I got into some trouble with a customer

00:00:20.305 --> 00:00:23.255
The person was completely furious

00:00:23.255 --> 00:00:26.075
I was talking to them through LINE

00:00:26.085 --> 00:00:28.705
I was trying to send a message of apology, when...

00:00:28.795 --> 00:00:31.935
Ai-chan's stamp of "I'm sorry!"

00:00:32.325 --> 00:00:34.015
Is what I accidentally sent

00:00:34.605 --> 00:00:37.835
"Aah, it's over... I'm going to look for a new job"

00:00:37.835 --> 00:00:40.845
That's what I was thinking, but then...

00:00:41.025 --> 00:00:43.745
"This is Kizuna Ai-chan, isn't it?"

00:00:43.745 --> 00:00:45.300
"I didn't know the stamps were out!"

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:46.720
That's what they said

00:00:47.035 --> 00:00:50.225
So I went ahead and sent the stamps as a present

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.280
Which fixed their mood

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.480
And now they're even regulars

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.040
It really was crisis averted

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:58.100
Wasn't it?

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.560
I was quite suspicious of it at first

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.840
That if you do a summoning after sending a Kizuna Ai LINE stamp

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.920
You're guaranteed a Ultra rare

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.320
According to a internet article

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:08.960
But I tried it

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.280
I thought it was probably just a ridiculous rumour

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:14.860
But when I tried it during a event...

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:16.640
I actually got 3 Ultra rares in a row

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:17.920
Really

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.800
Really, it was like, "easy peasy lemon squeezy"

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.620
I had a senpai whom I was fond of...

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.160
But I really couldn't find an opportunity to talk to them

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:28.880
But then...

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.580
When I used Ai-chan's stamp in a group chat

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.100
He said "You watch A.I.Channel too?"

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.100
"I also like that channel!"

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.920
We got talking from there

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:44.100
And now we're going on a date together!!

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.180
I think we might... get along!

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:48.380
How was that!

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.380
By the way, they were all personal views!

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.040
Like this, we've received lots of positive feedback, however

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:55.300
I, Kizuna Ai...

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:56.780
Am fastidious when it comes to marketing

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.000
From the release of the stamps, I was repeatedly ego-searching, but...

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.860
"I want installed faces~"

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:02.480
And

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.280
"Please include a ugly yell~!"

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.780
And

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:06.580
"Don't you have this? Or that?"

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:08.460
I get a lot of these kinds of requests!

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:10.620
However! It's 24

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:12.040
The LINE official stamps

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.140
I could only include 24 carefully chosen ones

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.800
That said...

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:20.660
So that you guys could use them in lots of places in lots of ways...

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.080
This time...

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.280
We're going to be releasing a second series!!

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:26.980
T-T-Thank you very much!!

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.040
People who thought, "There were LINE stamps?"

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.620
Please do download them together with the first series

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:32.920
The release date is...

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.020
Today! The 11th of January!

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:38.000
Since I, Kizuna Ai, am a cluster of hospitality

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.800
In the second series

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.540
I'll be making them while listening to everyone's requests

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:43.660
What kind of stamps are available

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.100
I'd like to introduce them along with usage examples

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:47.200
Please look this way!

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:48.880
[ I've arrived at the station, where are you?
I want to meet you soon Takkun ♡ ]

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.080
Whoa! Looks like a meet up

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:52.820
[ Good morning~ ]

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:54.480
A morning greeting!

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:55.700
How nice

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.840
[ Good morning ☼
Whereabouts are you now? ]

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.200
Hm? There's no reply

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.900
Did something happen?

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.600
[ Hey... Were you sleeping by any chance? ]

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:05.420
[ Missed call ]

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.420
She's lost her patience and called!

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.780
Looks like he's running late

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.780
[ The movie's going to start!
You good? You going to make it? ]

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:14.920
Aaaaaaaaaaaah

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.960
[ Missed call ]

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:17.380
The boyfriend...

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:19.060
Stubbornly doesn't answer the calls

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:22.620
[ You were late before as well and we had to change plans, didn't we?
You said you'd fix your habit of being late! ]

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.480
It's starting to look bad now...

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:28.040
[ WTF ]

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.820
There it is!!

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:32.660
Buying time with a meaningless stamp!!

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.820
The girlfriend's frustration is growing!

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:37.380
Boyfriend, what do you do!?

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:39.720
[ Forgive me please, nyan, nyan 🐾 ]

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.020
No way, seduction!

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.860
[ I'm done!
I'm splitting up!
I'm done with you, Takkun! ]

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:45.440
Oh boy, I guess my seduction isn't as effective against women...!?

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:46.640
[ Why...? ]

00:03:46.645 --> 00:03:48.295
The finishing crying appeal

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:54.640
There's no response, is it over!?

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:57.760
Oohh, the boyfriend, finally calls!!

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.140
What happens to the two of them...!?

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:01.840
[ Thanks for calling me 💕 I’m also sorry for getting angry. Thanks for calling me even when you’re so busy ❤️❤️❤️❤️ Your call made me very happy ❤️ ]

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.420
Love is blind! Right?
[ Thanks for calling me 💕 I’m also sorry for getting angry. Thanks for calling me even when you’re so busy ❤️❤️❤️❤️ Your call made me very happy ❤️ ]

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:05.440
I wonder what could have happened during that call
[ Thanks for calling me 💕 I’m also sorry for getting angry. Thanks for calling me even when you’re so busy ❤️❤️❤️❤️ Your call made me very happy ❤️ ]

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:06.340
Of course...
[ I love you! ]

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:09.420
...My stamps are very versatile, but...

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:12.380
Let's stop using the stamps to avoid escaping from any situation
[ I also love you very, very, very much Takkun! ❤️ I'll go to your house now, Takkun! ❤️ ]

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:13.300
What do you think?

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:15.540
Now you don't have any other choice than to download them!

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:16.180
Right?

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.560
In this occasion, the stamps also include my voice, so then if you want to use them another way that's not like a LINE stamp...

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:24.780
...If you feel the urge to hear my voice, it’d make me very happy if you press on the stamps

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:25.440
By the way...

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:30.300
The LINE store has the function of gifting the stamps to another person

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.980
After you downloaded it for yourselves, you can recommend it to your friends!

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:35.000
That's great!

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.800
My true feelings came out to the surface, I'm very sorry

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:37.480
Having said that...

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:40.700
...I left in the description of the video, the link to download the stamps from the LINE store

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:42.300
So then get them immediately! Yes?

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.060
Speed up the communication!

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:46.040
This was Virtual YouTuber Kizuna AI!

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:46.900
See you later!

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:47.920
By the way, the "Fuck you" stamp...

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:49.360
...I was told I couldn't publish it!

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:50.680
Yaaaaaaaay!

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:51.680
It was rejected!

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:54.680
