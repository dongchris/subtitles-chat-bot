00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:01.768
Nice to meet you

00:00:01.768 --> 00:00:03.320
Nice to meet you!

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:05.572
My name is Uesaka Sumire, I'm a voice actor

00:00:05.572 --> 00:00:07.040
I'm Virtual YouTuber

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:07.774
Kizuna AI!

00:00:07.774 --> 00:00:09.376
Looking forward to today!

00:00:09.376 --> 00:00:12.112
Count on me as if you were on a big boat!
(TL: A saying meaning, "Leave it to me, I got this")

00:00:12.112 --> 00:00:13.480
Really...?

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:14.960
Really!

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.083
What should I call you?

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.751
AI-chan

00:00:17.751 --> 00:00:18.485
AI-chan

00:00:18.485 --> 00:00:20.387
Sumire-chan...

00:00:20.387 --> 00:00:21.955
Can I call you that?

00:00:21.955 --> 00:00:23.757
That's a little over-familiar...

00:00:23.757 --> 00:00:25.525
A little over-familiar!?

00:00:25.525 --> 00:00:28.240
Well, then, "Sumire-chan" is fine for today

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:29.880
Ah! "Sumire-chan" is OK

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:30.380
Sure

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:31.160
Yay!

00:00:31.164 --> 00:00:31.998
I...

00:00:31.998 --> 00:00:36.836
For a game app called "Ordinal Strata"'s promotion

00:00:36.836 --> 00:00:39.072
I was told to come here

00:00:39.072 --> 00:00:41.474
...I appear in Ordinal Strata

00:00:41.474 --> 00:00:44.377
As a character called "Ordina"

00:00:44.377 --> 00:00:48.590
But I don't have any props today for promoting

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:50.410
So I'm not sure what to do

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:50.900
Kizuna-san-

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:51.400
No no!

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.060
Ah, AI-chan, have you heard anything?

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.753
What's that?

00:00:53.753 --> 00:00:54.554
I haven't heard anything

00:00:54.554 --> 00:00:55.889
You haven't!?

00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:57.240
It's ok, it's ok

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.592
Is YouTube such a "whatever" kind of place?

00:00:59.993 --> 00:01:01.628
Jokiness and following the flow are the most important

00:01:01.628 --> 00:01:03.096
So for today

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.120
We're going to do something most YouTubers do at some point

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.040
A video idea that you could almost call a gateway towards success!

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.960
H-How about Ordinal Strata?

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:12.172
No problem, no problem!

00:01:12.172 --> 00:01:13.960
Let's just do whatever we want!

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:15.408
Alright~

00:01:15.408 --> 00:01:16.443
So

00:01:16.443 --> 00:01:18.211
A staple for YouTubers,

00:01:18.211 --> 00:01:18.711
This!

00:01:18.711 --> 00:01:19.345
This?

00:01:19.345 --> 00:01:19.879
This!

00:01:19.879 --> 00:01:20.547
What's this?

00:01:20.547 --> 00:01:23.116
We're going to use this black carbonated drink

00:01:23.116 --> 00:01:26.052
Do you watch YouTube often?

00:01:26.052 --> 00:01:28.455
I sometimes watch Soviet Union videos...

00:01:28.455 --> 00:01:29.522
. . .

00:01:29.522 --> 00:01:33.159
...Using this black carbonated drink

00:01:33.293 --> 00:01:34.694
"Mentos + cola"

00:01:34.694 --> 00:01:35.550
A: "Mentos + cola"
S: I see

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:36.596
Is what I'd like to do

00:01:36.596 --> 00:01:40.220
I've heard it has quite a strong impact...

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.560
Is that what we're going to do today?

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.969
That's right!

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:45.171
...Rather than "we"

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.320
Sumire-chan!

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.140
Me?

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:48.441
I'd like you to do it!

00:01:48.441 --> 00:01:50.677
I'm virtual, so...

00:01:50.677 --> 00:01:53.613
I'll be cheering you on from here

00:01:53.613 --> 00:01:54.981
Let's go!

00:01:54.981 --> 00:01:55.682
I'll try my best!

00:01:55.682 --> 00:01:57.020
Please go change!

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.940
Got it

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:00.810
Well then... I'll go over there and change my clothes

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:03.356
AI-chan I'm back...

00:02:03.356 --> 00:02:04.457
Welcome back!

00:02:04.457 --> 00:02:06.326
Your raincoat is cute!

00:02:06.326 --> 00:02:08.328
Stop lying

00:02:08.328 --> 00:02:10.040
I'm not lying!

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.540
S: This raincoat...

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:11.698
A: Because even if you wear a raincoat
S: This raincoat...

00:02:11.698 --> 00:02:13.032
A: Your face is still the same!

00:02:13.032 --> 00:02:14.234
This raincoat is too stinky...

00:02:14.234 --> 00:02:15.068
What should I do?

00:02:15.068 --> 00:02:16.310
It stinks?

00:02:16.703 --> 00:02:18.004
Let's do it! Let's do it!

00:02:18.004 --> 00:02:19.105
Let it explode!

00:02:19.105 --> 00:02:20.406
Ready...

00:02:20.406 --> 00:02:22.408
"Mentos-Cola!"

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:24.410
AI-chan...

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:25.545
I'm scared...

00:02:25.545 --> 00:02:26.646
If I put this

00:02:26.646 --> 00:02:28.710
Inside the fizzy drink

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:30.280
It's going to be crazy...

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:31.140
So

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.640
Everyone has umbrellas out

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:33.980
And is defending themselves...

00:02:33.987 --> 00:02:35.421
I'm the only one

00:02:35.421 --> 00:02:36.890
Bare...

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:38.658
By the way, how are feeling right now?

00:02:38.758 --> 00:02:40.293
"What am I doing..."

00:02:40.293 --> 00:02:41.461
Is what I'm thinking

00:02:41.461 --> 00:02:43.163
Closing the lid...

00:02:43.163 --> 00:02:44.264
So now, if I

00:02:44.264 --> 00:02:45.598
Remove the string

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.034
It's going to go "bam" so

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.600
Bam!

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:49.035
5

00:02:49.035 --> 00:02:50.103
4

00:02:50.103 --> 00:02:51.204
3

00:02:51.204 --> 00:02:52.305
2

00:02:52.305 --> 00:02:53.039
1

00:03:00.747 --> 00:03:02.749
A: It's raining! It's raining!
S: It's really pouring everywhere

00:03:02.749 --> 00:03:03.249
Eh!

00:03:04.184 --> 00:03:05.485
Ahhhhh~

00:03:05.485 --> 00:03:07.387
It's cola rain...

00:03:07.387 --> 00:03:09.422
AI-chan?!

00:03:09.422 --> 00:03:10.623
AI-chan's...

00:03:10.623 --> 00:03:11.380
A: The remaining...

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:11.900
A: The remaining...
S: AI-chan's covered in soft drink...

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.660
The remaining promotion...
S: AI-chan's covered in soft drink...

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:14.894
I leave it to you...

00:03:14.894 --> 00:03:16.362
Man...

00:03:16.396 --> 00:03:19.632
This was not something we should've done in a rented place...

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:21.267
Did we succeed?

00:03:21.267 --> 00:03:22.180
We've...

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:23.100
Succeeded!

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:24.560
...You can't say that

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:25.900
While being absolutely soaked

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.260
A: I'm happy!
S: By the way...

00:03:27.407 --> 00:03:29.475
How about the "Ordinal Strata" promotion?

00:03:29.475 --> 00:03:31.544
Maybe we don’t have to do it...

00:03:31.544 --> 00:03:32.779
Is what I thought but...

00:03:32.779 --> 00:03:35.315
Giving Sumire-chan a reason to be worried

00:03:35.315 --> 00:03:36.816
That would make me sad

00:03:36.816 --> 00:03:37.951
I would like to announce

00:03:37.951 --> 00:03:39.018
Oh! It’s an announcement!

00:03:39.018 --> 00:03:39.960
Surprise!

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:40.486
Surprise?

00:03:40.653 --> 00:03:42.288
Ordinal Strata

00:03:42.288 --> 00:03:43.823
To celebrate the release of the game

00:03:43.823 --> 00:03:44.524
There will be a present

00:03:44.524 --> 00:03:45.692
For everyone!

00:03:45.692 --> 00:03:48.528
I’m glad that there is a present for everyone! Hurray!

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.020
In order to claim that,

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:52.400
You only have to login to the game!

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.033
S: Only that?
A: Only for a short period of time!

00:03:54.033 --> 00:03:55.735
You will be able to

00:03:55.735 --> 00:03:57.770
Obtain the SSR weapon “Nihiti Sphere”

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:59.272
Ohhh!!

00:03:59.272 --> 00:04:00.573
Sumire-chan!

00:04:00.573 --> 00:04:01.674
As a YouTuber

00:04:01.674 --> 00:04:03.240
When you upload a video advertising

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:05.678
You’ll always have to say a specific line

00:04:05.678 --> 00:04:06.840
To download (the game)...

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.615
Please check out the description...

00:04:08.615 --> 00:04:11.060
A: Will you do it together with me?
S: Of course!

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:12.685
Oh! Thank you very much!

00:04:12.685 --> 00:04:14.053
1... 2...

00:04:14.053 --> 00:04:17.657
A&amp;S: To download (the game) please check out the description!
