00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:03.020
Hello everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai here!

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:07.080
To tell you the truth, there's something that I need all of you to help me with

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.120
If you ask me what I'm referring to...

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.400
Ja, jhaan!

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:14.320
"The last questions of the Questions Corner of A.I.Channel of the year 2017!"

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.040
A lot! A lot! A lot of requests!

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.680
Man, we've already reached the end of the year, right?

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.820
Today I'll be gathering requests for questions for the last round of Question Corner of the year!

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.980
Really, thank you so much to everyone who sends me requests in moments like these!

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.580
Thank you so much everyone! I love you!

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:32.220
I read everything you send me

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:35.720
Just like before I'll be receiving questions regardless of what it is...

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:36.960
...So then don't hesitate to send them!

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.560
I will attempt to respond to the majority of the questions at high speed so then I'm counting on you guys!

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.120
The deadline will be...

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.380
...A week from when this video is published!

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.080
Regarding how to participate, you can comment in this video!

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:52.620
Or if you want, you can send your questions through other social networks (Twitter, Facebook), whichever you prefer!

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.140
Nevertheless! There is one thing you need to take into account!

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:02.100
Those who send me their questions, including in the comments, must include the hashtag
#はいどーも

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.760
To make sure I don't lose any questions...

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:09.560
...Please make sure to use the hashtag in hiragana this way: "はいどーも" even if you’re foreigners

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:10.380
That is all!

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.280
Since this will be the final question corner for 2017, I’ll be waiting anxiously to get a lot of questions

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.640
Good! For all those who thought "Since she has already asked us to send her questions then today's video is over"

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:22.280
You guys! You guys! You guys!

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:23.560
That's right, you guys!

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:27.800
"Aaah... I wanted to see more of the cute and adorable Ai-chan"

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:31.040
Yes, yes, I’ve taken into consideration the voices of your hearts!

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.140
Don’t worry! I have something planned!

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.540
I call it... "I’m an A.I, do you have any question? Part 4!!"

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:38.560
Four!

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.820
It turns out that it’s the 4th time I’ve done this!

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:42.420
Eh? You don’t know about it?

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.980
For you who have said that, make sure to check my previous videos

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.960
I’ll be leaving a link in the description of this video so then I’ll be counting on you guys!

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.340
A.I.Channeeeel!

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:53.440
Let me introduce myself once again

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.720
I’m the intelligent and Super A.I Kizuna AI

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.300
This time, I’ll be explaining to you...

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.580
...Those words that you think: "To tell you the truth, I don’t know what it means very well"

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:08.260
Good, here is the Random Word Generator!

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:09.980
I plan to explain it in an “excellent” way...

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:12.500
...The words chosen from here

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.820
Jaka, jaka, jaka, jaka...

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:15.500
JAN!

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.960
PDCA?

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.940
Ah! Ah! PDCA!

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.620
Ah! I know it now!

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:26.280
Here I go

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.720
"PDCA" is...

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.820
"Perfect Dancing Cute Aichan"

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.380
If you take away the first letter of each word, it makes...

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:33.880
P D C A!

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:34.860
Do you get it?

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.060
Well, basically it's a word directed to me, right?

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.760
Good, I'll be showing you how to use that word

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:42.060
Hey, look, look!

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.500
Isn’t today’s video of Ai-chan really PDCA?

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.080
That's right, it’s Melancholic and her movements are so adorable!!

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.500
Man, it’s PDCA

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:53.780
That was very easy

00:02:53.780 --> 00:03:00.020
All of you make sure to use the phrase
"It’s really PDCA!" when you upload dancing videos

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:01.260
In that case, let's continue…

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.360
Jaka, jaka, jajajajaja... Jajaaan!

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:05.340
"Agree"

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.860
Agree... agree... amaguri... agree...

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:10.360
Ah!

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:11.360
I got it!

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.080
Agree is... Amaguri glacé
(Japanese call marron often "Amaguri")

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:15.940
You know, it's...

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:20.280
...That chestnut that goes on desserts like on Mont Blanc is called "agree"

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.920
Amaguri... Agree... something like that, right?

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.460
In that case, I’ll show you an example

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:35.280
Hmm...! This "Agree" of Mont Blanc is really delicious! It’s the best!

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.900
No, well, I can eat a lot of these "Agree"

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.860
Man, this is very useful, right?

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:44.020
Right?

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:45.340
In that case, next up...

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.760
Jajajajajajajaja... Jaaan!

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:49.620
Fact Base

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.740
Ah! I think I've heard of this one before...

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:53.980
What was it?

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:55.360
Ah! I got it! I got it!

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:56.860
Good! Here I go!

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:58.340
Fact Base is...

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:00.260
The "base of perfection"

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:02.520
Regarding the use of the word Fact Base...

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:05.440
Well... that which is normally impossible...
How do I say it?

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:06.880
This is what tends to happen in anime...

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:08.340
...When you touch an instrument going "Jajaaaan"

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:12.300
...And launch an attack at the enemy, the capability of doing this is known as "Fact base"

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:14.080
It’s rather futuristic! Right?

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:16.540
Eh... I’ll show you an example!

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.800
Damn it! Is this my end?

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:21.020
No, but even still...!

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.120
While I have... this Fact Base...!

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:27.120
Onward! Jajaaaaan!

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:30.740
Good, I ruined the joke

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:32.220
Well, it refers to that, right?

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:34.600
Good, well…

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.820
Make sure to use this expression in a banquet and ruin the joke please
