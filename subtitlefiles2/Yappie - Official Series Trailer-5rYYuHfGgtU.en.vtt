00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.250
Hello America.

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.560
I'm an Asian.

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:15.740
An Asian-American to be exact.

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:18.020
You've seen some of us around.

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:21.780
Oh, you know us.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.660
Well, you think you know us.

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:28.380
Cheers bro!

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:29.380
Oh my god.

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:33.200
I've noticed that you have a lot of Chinese friends in the office.

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.600
Look, listen! Let's come together as one for one greater purpose!

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.600
Korean pride, bitch.

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.680
You're a yappie, Andrew.

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.140
A what?

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.720
A young Asian professional who acts like a yuppie.

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:53.000
Because all you care about is earning a nice salary and settling down in a nice suburb.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.540
What's so wrong with that?

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:56.960
It's just... safe.

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:02.620
If- if I'm a yappie, you're a yippie!

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:05.380
Young hippie!

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.880
I'm not gonna feed into these stereotypes any longer by living a lie.

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.220
Are you okay, ge?

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:16.350
We're kind of in our own little bubble.

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.480
Why don't we have black friends?

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:19.800
I mean, I have some coworkers.

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.080
Back in February, didn't you help plan the event for Black History Month?

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.520
You didn't go? Do you not support our history?

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:27.220
No, no, no

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:28.560
Dude, I'm kidding.

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:29.500
*laughs*

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:30.520
It was lit as fuck.

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:31.220
Yeah...

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.380
Can you imagine if our parents let us do anything other than Kumon or Model UN?

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:56.080
We literally just joked about how me and my friends are in a bubble, but I never questioned it.

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.620
Maybe that did more harm than good.

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.620
Round of yappies on me man!

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:05.620
*laughs*

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:07.620
Is that not what it is?

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.080
- I can't believe it's finally out there for everyone to see.

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.020
We really hope that you enjoyed that trailer for yappie.

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.259
- Yeah, and we hope even more than you like the series once it starts coming out on June 20th.

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.420
- This show is super important and special to Wong Fu Productions

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.120
It's something I've been imagining for years,

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.949
and for the past six months we've been hard at work to make this first season of five episodes.

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.560
- Yeah, we self-financed and produced this series

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.840
because we realized we have a lot to say about the world and our community

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.560
and we didn't want to wait any longer to tell it.

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:47.270
- And also a huge thanks and shout out to our Patreon community of Wong Fu Forward careholders.

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:49.640
This show would not have happened without you guys.

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:54.960
If you'd like to help support Wong Fu and our efforts to create bigger projects and meaningful projects like this,

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:59.690

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:04.850
- We know you guys probably have a lot of questions about the series, but all will be answered on June 20th.

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:07.279
- We'll see you there. - Byeeeeyah.
