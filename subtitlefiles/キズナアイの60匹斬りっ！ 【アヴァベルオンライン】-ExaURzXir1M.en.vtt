Hello guys, it's Virtual Gamer, Kizuna Ai!

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:05.480
I'm also a Virtual Adventurer

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:10.040
It seems like we've reached the 8th level!

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:11.420
please look at it

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:12.820
take this!

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:15.880
How's that?

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:18.320
I've become strong!

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:20.240
Eat this!

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:24.660
and this and this!

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:26.440
and now we are here

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.260
Because I've become stronger

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.320
this time

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.300
so I thought, why not go on an adventure

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.420
but before I can reach the level where I can go on adventures

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:41.780
today I'll be making a guild

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.360
so I can go on quests with all of you

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.800
I thought it was time to connect with you guys

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.480
because I wanted to show you guys my cool points

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.820
I’m going back.

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:53.760
I’ve come to the third floor!

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.880
a salamander appeared!

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.900
oh! There are a lot of people

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.140

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:01.120

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:02.360

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.100

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:17.880

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.780
Salamander??? He's not here

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:46.380

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:11.380
The salamander was only 60

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:12.580
that's pretty darn weak

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.440
it took quite a bit of time

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.080
welcome! Salamander

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.040

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:28.540
Awesome, awesome

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:30.340

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:33.440

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.260

That feels good! It's like everyone has the same goal here

00:03:02.885 --> 00:03:03.900
Helping each other

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.500

so then... As everyone has grouped up!

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:39.780
I've heard that 9th floor boss is really strong

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.840
Even tho I am not sure I can beat this by myself alone,

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:46.020
I wanna try it with everyone and see if we can beat it!

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.060
