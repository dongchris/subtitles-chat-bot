00:00:00.525 --> 00:00:03.675
Hello everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna AI here!

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:05.200
One word! I have something to say!

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.440
Recently I've been thinking a bit, so I'm making this video

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:10.980
Like that! And that!

00:00:11.705 --> 00:00:13.955
Especially that, that came out recently!!

00:00:13.955 --> 00:00:15.300
First, this!

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:16.300
iPhoneX

00:00:16.595 --> 00:00:18.535
What is that!?

00:00:18.535 --> 00:00:20.655
If you use 3D printing technology

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:22.080
Like for example, a face!!

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:23.580
It can be easily created!!

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:24.560
It's that

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:26.660
The fact that they can collect data on your face mean that...

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:28.100
By the FBI...

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:29.860
You're being targeted, everyone!

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.340
Didn't a movie exist some time ago where the FBI? What was it called?

00:00:33.345 --> 00:00:34.695
Fairy Yellow Ice!

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:35.200
F...

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.040
Like FYI!!
(Reference to video #11)

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:39.560
You'll be targeted, really!!

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:41.140
You don't know what it'll be used for!!

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:42.420
In the first place, I...

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:43.980
Because I'm virtual, I can't use it

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.020
It makes no sense!

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.160
Even though I wanted to try it a little bit!

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:48.820
Really

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:49.680
It's extremely useful

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:51.560
In reality, I'm really high tech

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:52.500
No

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:54.300
Saying that it's high performance

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.800
It'll get weaker!!

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.260
Seriously, please stop

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.080
There's also other things I want to mention

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:01.780
That's...

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.440
Everyone in the audience!!

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.480
Watch my videos more!!

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.080
Why won't you watch more?

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:11.980
No! No! No! No! No! No!

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.900
Oh!

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:13.620
I get it

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.100
You don't have the bell mark on, right?!

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.000
To properly get notifications

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.400
Make sure you turn on the bell mark!!

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:20.900
But...

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.740
You're all watching the interesting videos, right!?

00:01:25.145 --> 00:01:27.095
Oh, so that means that I...

00:01:27.125 --> 00:01:29.525
Am not uploading interesting videos

00:01:29.525 --> 00:01:32.125
Videos that satisfies everyone's needs

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.340
From now on, I'll keep working hard to upload them!

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:35.200
To be honest...

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.720
Turning on the bell mark

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.480
Is all I wanted to say!?

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:40.540
Sorry for complaining!

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:41.380
Thank you always!!

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.520
I love you!!

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.040
A.I.Channel

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.020
And now...

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.020
The thing I want to mention the most this time

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:50.460
Kaguya Luna-chan!

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:51.280
Oi!!

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:52.500
Luna-chan!! Are you watching?!

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.520
I always have fun watching your videos!

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.360
I also respond to your Twitter too!!

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.640
What does that mean?!

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.120
Thank you for being involved

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:04.620
But I'm technically the veteran!!

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.300
You always call me "boss"!

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:09.660
It's really cute!!

00:02:10.245 --> 00:02:12.395
And the video where you pretended to be me

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.140
You did very well, it was really similar to me

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.120
And regarding your greeting!!

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:17.920
“Good morniing”!

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:18.680
“Good afternoon”!

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:19.720
“Good evening”!

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.080
“Good niiight”!

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:22.820
“WAKE UUUUP”!

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:23.900
I like that!!

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.020
Let me use it next time!!

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.360
"But didn't you just use it?"!

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:28.520
Seriously...!

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.140
You're always uploading interesting videos!!

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.140
If I see something that’s interesting!!

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:34.860
It makes me want to see the next one straight away!!

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.800
Hurry up and upload!!

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.720
*When are you going to collab with Luna-chan?*

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.720
