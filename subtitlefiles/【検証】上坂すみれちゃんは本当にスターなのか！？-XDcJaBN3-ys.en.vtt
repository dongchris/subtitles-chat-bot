00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.020
Hi everyone! Virtual Youtuber Kizuna Ai and...

00:00:03.075 --> 00:00:05.525
Voice actress Uesaka Sumire here!

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:09.320
Today, will I be able to properly

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:11.300
Promote Ordinal Strata?

00:00:11.311 --> 00:00:13.088
It's okay!

00:00:13.089 --> 00:00:14.413
A: Sumire-chan is in charge of character voices and you're in the video so
Sumire: Yes

00:00:14.414 --> 00:00:17.493
A: Sumire-chan is in charge of character voices and you're in the video so

00:00:17.494 --> 00:00:20.140
I think that's enough publicity

00:00:20.141 --> 00:00:23.026
Umm that's a bit...

00:00:23.027 --> 00:00:25.312
For Ordinal Strata we need to look at it's charms

00:00:25.313 --> 00:00:29.718
Promotion videos are supposed to do that so

00:00:29.719 --> 00:00:33.477
Today, I was expecting that we would include that aspect in this video

00:00:33.478 --> 00:00:34.340
What do you think?

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.976
No!

00:00:34.977 --> 00:00:35.707
Noo!!

00:00:35.708 --> 00:00:36.833
What is up with this girl!

00:00:36.834 --> 00:00:38.840
Even if you say that we are doing something else

00:00:38.841 --> 00:00:40.841
What are we doing today~

00:00:40.962 --> 00:00:43.723
For now, if we want to do something related to a promotion

00:00:43.724 --> 00:00:44.793
A: There is something we must do

00:00:44.794 --> 00:00:45.275
S: Yes
A: There is something we must do

00:00:45.275 --> 00:00:47.848
There are lots of ladies and gentlemen here

00:00:47.849 --> 00:00:48.659
A: Isn't that right?
S: Yes yes yes

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:49.959
That's right~

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.884
If Sumire-chan says "Ordinal Strata!"

00:00:52.884 --> 00:00:56.459
with a pose. If you do that it will be a good promotion.

00:00:56.828 --> 00:00:59.226
Isn't that just a one shot performance?

00:00:59.227 --> 00:01:00.632
It's not a one shot performance!

00:01:00.633 --> 00:01:01.575
Try it!

00:01:01.645 --> 00:01:03.130
Ordinal Strata

00:01:03.131 --> 00:01:06.987
Yes! Perfect~! Now the app will get lots of profit~♪

00:01:06.988 --> 00:01:09.813
S:It's not that simple~!
A: Of course!

00:01:09.814 --> 00:01:11.035
Do it once more ♪

00:01:11.036 --> 00:01:13.455
Eh? Ordinal Strata ♪

00:01:13.456 --> 00:01:15.044
She does it for me~!

00:01:15.045 --> 00:01:15.980
Mann!!!

00:01:15.981 --> 00:01:16.585
Well-

00:01:16.585 --> 00:01:19.613
I'm going to explain today's plan now

00:01:19.614 --> 00:01:23.518
I think Sumire-chan is a super star right now!

00:01:23.519 --> 00:01:27.352
No no, I'm nothing like that

00:01:27.353 --> 00:01:28.749
A super star?

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:29.908
Yes a super star!

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.367
Sumire-chan has something that

00:01:32.368 --> 00:01:33.845
other people don't

00:01:33.846 --> 00:01:34.212
Okay

00:01:34.212 --> 00:01:35.670
I would like to verify that!

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.576
How are you going to verify that?

00:01:37.577 --> 00:01:38.242
With the Gacha game!

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.630
I know what gacha is, the popular people-
(TL: gacha is the summon in this game)

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.950
Ah yes.  If you are popular

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.320
S: You set an amount and open up a lot

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:46.770
S: Is that what it is?
A: Yes yes yes

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:47.680
S: Alright!
A: Without further ado

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.940
I want to go ahead with spinning Oridinal Strata summons

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:52.410
Spinning

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:53.850
The planning for gacha is

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.840
as expected is to prepare your money

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:57.500
Crap

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.130
S: I just bought too many clothes so I don't have any money at all
A: Yeah I thought as much

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:03.500
I'm scared of making your fans my enemies so-

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:04.160
Ehehehe

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.540
I have prepared some funds

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:07.440
"Ohh!"

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.100
Well Sumire-chan

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.539
If you immediately pull what I was hoping for

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:12.940
Then the pain in my chest

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.180
no matter how much it hurts

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.370
the remaining iTunes cards

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.300
will accumulate

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:20.980
This is what is means to be a YouTuber

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.470
Within the limited budget

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:26.020
If we can get the character we are hoping for

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:27.720
The remaining difference

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.900
will we give away to our viewers

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.380
Ai-chan you are so kind hearted

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.240
Further from the management-

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:35.520
we have a give away!

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:36.660
Sumire-chan

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.950
for every consecutive 10 tries

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:39.690
can you believe it

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:40.910
the viewers will get

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:42.950
10 quartz!

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:44.440
Oh that's amazing

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:45.820
We are seriously

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:47.320
planning to do the summoning

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:49.520
What are you aiming to get Ai-chan?

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:50.640
Clair-chan

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:51.660
Clair-san

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.000
A: My most favorite one is
S: Yes?

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.040
A: Aloha-chan though
S: Yes

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.780
It's unfortunate that she is only an SR

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.690
S: So we are hoping to get two, sort of feeling
A: Oh!

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:03.440
S: Let's get going
A: Let's go

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.187
Time to buy stones

00:03:06.188 --> 00:03:07.880
Purchase Quartz?

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:09.210
How many-

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:10.510
How many Quartz should we buy?

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.010
Umm the one with the most?  9000-

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.900
Is it the ¥9800 one?

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.710
One time purchase 1700 Quartz

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:20.320
Umm you know

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.470
I only just realised

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.630
I've only put in ¥3000 from the card

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:28.720
I bought ¥9800 worth of summoning

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:32.250
Ai- Ai-chan it seems that I've used your allowance or something to buy it

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:34.000
A: "AHH!!!"
S: "Hahaha"

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.320
I'm going to

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:36.670
to start the summoning

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:37.440
It's like this-

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.660
When you tap the 10 summon

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.580
Asusena-chan will appear

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:44.780
If Asusena-chan is holding a rainbow colored crystal

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:46.470
we have a confirmed SSR!

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.950
Then-

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:50.260
If a mage makes an entrance

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:51.490
if the mage

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:54.350
is golden then it will become an SSR!!

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:56.020
Are we all prepared?

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:58.040
Alright I understand.  It will be fine

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:59.030
It's time to pull

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:01.690
10 consecutive summons.  Confirm

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:06.470
Oh

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.700
It's golden so that means-

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:11.330
What is this?

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:13.360
What is this?

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.890
Oh

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:16.330
Oh

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:17.430
What is this?

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:19.340
Oh

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:20.590
Oh

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:22.640
Ah

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:24.980
There seems to be a lot of weapons

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:25.910
Yes

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:26.350
Ah

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:27.270
S: This is?
A: AH

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:28.340
S: It's Aloha-chan
A: Ah ah!

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.450
S: Aloha-chan appeared Ai-chan!
A: Oh thank god!

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:32.900
As expected Sumire-chan is lucky!

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:35.400
We've hired a star!

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.938
S: Hurray!
A: Hurray! We've hired a star!

00:04:37.939 --> 00:04:39.539
Hi five!

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:41.820
A: Yay
S: Yay

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:44.180
I am totally a star then

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:44.740
Eh

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:45.830
That's it for work?

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:46.510
Ah You-

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:47.370
You still need to tap-

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:47.870
Ah-

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:51.300
That's right there is still a lot left

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:53.880
The weapons are just coming one after another

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:00.800
S: Sometimes this person will show up
A: Oh?

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.590
S: Like so- I see
A: Yes yes yes

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:08.020
Mmm

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:10.370
SSR~

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:12.950
SSR~

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:24.680
Well even so

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:25.930
Aloha-chan appeared

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:26.670
Yeah

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:30.060
Can I start the second 10 consecutive summon?

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:32.100
Yes let's keep going

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:34.250
What is going to appear?

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:34.620
Oh

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:36.490
S: It's a rainbow stone
A: Ah ah Ah!

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:37.070
Oh

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:38.040
S: This is
A: This is

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:39.790
S: What is going to appear~
A: Ah ah ah

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:41.440
There are two golden ones

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:42.000
Oh

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:42.390
Eh

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:43.600
Looking good?

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:45.250
Maybe?

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:45.920
Oh

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:46.480
Oh

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:48.160
Oh

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:49.280
"Eh- he- he-"

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:51.870
Oh

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:54.070
S: An SSR character
A: Ohhh!
Game: My name is Imelda

00:05:54.071 --> 00:05:54.662
Game: My name is Imelda

00:05:54.663 --> 00:05:55.890
S: has appeared
A: Imelda-chan

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:57.210
Imelda-san

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:59.610
G: Would you like to try my sweets?

00:06:00.079 --> 00:06:01.179
G: It's nice~

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:02.686
There are a lot of SR

00:06:02.687 --> 00:06:04.000
A lot

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:05.510
"Ara"

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:06.260
"Ah-"

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:08.060
Amazing

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:10.100
Oh the one before was only just a weapon

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:10.570
Yeah

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:13.630
It seems that it's just weapons this time

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:14.500
Hmm hmm

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:16.780
S: With that
A: But-

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:18.080
SSR!

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:20.149
S: SSR rare has appeared
A: There are two of them

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:23.550
It's a big prize if you get a weapon and a character, right?

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:24.730
Let's keep going!

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:25.690
Here we go!

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:27.560
What is going to appear?

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:28.010
What-

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:28.510
Oh-

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:31.380
Oh

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:33.610
Oh

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:34.120
Oh!

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:35.590
A &amp; S: Oh~

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:36.050
Ah

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:37.270
S: It was just a weapon

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:39.230
S: So close
A: There was nothing

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:42.720
Oh~

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:44.210
S: So-
A: Even so

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:44.735
Mm

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:45.930
Looking good

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:46.830
Up to now

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:48.750
we got 3 SSR

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:49.920
A: Ah that's right
S: Hm?

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:51.230
I

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:54.280
have come a long way in this project

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:55.420
Well surely

00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:59.120
I and Sumire-chan have worked this hard

00:06:59.120 --> 00:06:59.760
Mmm

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:02.030
The management as well

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:04.380
don't you think they should do something as well?

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:07.720
Well sure.  We have worked really hard

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:08.800
Before-

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:13.010
the management said that for every 10 consecutive summons

00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:17.480
A: They will give out 10 Quartz but-
S: Yes

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:19.590
Don't you want a bit more?

00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:21.640
I want about 1700

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:23.860
For every 10 consecutive summon

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:25.170
at least

00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:27.440
I would want 36

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:28.230
Yes surely

00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:32.170
S: If you have 36 then you can do a single summon
A: Yes yes yes

00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:33.410
How does that sound?

00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:35.220
How does that sound?

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:38.270
For what you have done now... 36 x 3

00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:39.450
Just what we have done now?

00:07:39.450 --> 00:07:41.200
Clair-chan still hasn't appeared

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:42.720
That's true

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:45.350
Then how about 15...

00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:47.650
S: 15 Ai-chan is 15?
A: 15?

00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:49.710
I can't really be satisfied with that

00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:52.490
This girl is going at it again

00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:53.870
Ok I'm going to give in

00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:56.620
360 is a 10 consecutive summon

00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:57.810
so-

00:07:57.810 --> 00:08:00.030
a multiple of 3.  So 30 of them!

00:08:00.030 --> 00:08:02.860
Did you really give in or not? I don't know.  How does that sound?

00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:05.050
For 30 if you work hard, it should be possible

00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:06.860
So if we work hard then we can do it right?

00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:07.490
Oh

00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:08.940
Well everyone

00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:10.380
You heard that right?

00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:13.010
For every 10 consecutive summons by Sumire-chan

00:08:13.010 --> 00:08:15.950
everyone gets 30 Quartz

00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:20.090
Intermission

00:08:20.090 --> 00:08:21.360
Just now-

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:23.280
they said to stop the camera

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:25.370
and the filming was to be put on hold

00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:27.070
A: They said that yes.
S: Well- well-

00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:30.700
"No matter what 30 is impossible.  Please forgive us "

00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:33.230
is what they said

00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:38.220
They said "How does 15 sound?" to our producers

00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:40.490
They said apologetically

00:08:40.490 --> 00:08:41.910
Please with 15

00:08:41.910 --> 00:08:43.770
will you give to that?

00:08:43.770 --> 00:08:45.010
S: Ai-chan
A: Sumire-chan

00:08:45.010 --> 00:08:45.420
Yes?

00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:46.710
You are being fooled

00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:47.440
Eh?

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:49.010
Add 5 more

00:08:49.010 --> 00:08:49.950
and make it 20

00:08:49.950 --> 00:08:51.070
20?

00:08:51.070 --> 00:08:51.810
Okay

00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:52.610
Ah

00:08:52.610 --> 00:08:53.930
We have a compromise

00:08:53.930 --> 00:08:56.060
Oh Yeah.  I won!!

00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:58.520
Anyways if I just summon the right one

00:08:58.520 --> 00:08:58.920
right?

00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:00.210
I’ll...

00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:02.560
Finish this quickly to ensure your gifts won’t be reduced

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:04.200
I will try my best and get out target!

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:05.800
Ha.. Pleas-

00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:06.650
Ahhh...

00:09:06.650 --> 00:09:08.380
S: Ahh… This looks bad...
A: Ahh… But!

00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:09.470
A: You can tell yet!

00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:10.610
S: Really?

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:17.410
Uwa… This time…

00:09:17.410 --> 00:09:19.680
We didn’t get much from it...

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:20.970
S: Uwa… This is hard…
A: Its okay!

00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:22.740
A: Let’s continue!
S: Let’s continue?

00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:39.640
Ah...

00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:40.670
It seems like...

00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:43.070
We have used up the stones...

00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:44.310
Then let’s add more!

00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:47.120
Alright! Let’s add more!

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:49.950
I am going to get them all! I am going to get them all!

00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:52.110
I’m going to charge a lot into my account!

00:09:52.110 --> 00:09:54.200
9800 Yen… Which means...

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:55.600
We have to sacrifice 4 iTunes cards right?

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:57.440
A: Ahh… You're right! Um-hum!
S: Um-hum!

00:09:57.440 --> 00:09:58.280
A: Wait Sumire-chan...

00:09:58.670 --> 00:09:59.750
S: Hum?

00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:01.840
Did you take an extra one?
Really?

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:02.680
Really?

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:03.540
I'll get it all!

00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:05.330
I'll keep going until it comes out!

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:30.500
Ah!

00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:32.480
I ran out of gems!

00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:33.420
Eh? That's fast.

00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:34.170
It's fast!

00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:36.190
To think it would run out this quickly.

00:10:36.190 --> 00:10:36.900
Wah....

00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:38.440
It won't come out, Aichan…

00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:40.220
Sumire-chan have

00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:41.480
already proven

00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:41.980
Your “star” nature

00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:43.460
But from this point...

00:10:43.470 --> 00:10:45.110
If I keep purchasing stones.

00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:47.780
These sparkling iTunes cards will

00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:49.610
end up perishing too so...

00:10:49.610 --> 00:10:51.520
Let's just leave it as it is for today?

00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:52.500
Let's do that!

00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:54.250
If you say so, then no choice.

00:10:54.250 --> 00:10:54.950
Um!

00:10:54.950 --> 00:10:55.510
Yes!

00:10:55.510 --> 00:10:57.040
So with that being said...

00:10:57.040 --> 00:10:57.880
About these...

00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:00.060
iTunes cards...

00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:01.400
I'd like to make them into presents!

00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:04.050
Everyone, please use these cards!

00:11:04.050 --> 00:11:06.660
Aichan's treating you to these cards.

00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:09.330
Can I ask for one favour though?

00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:10.290
What is it?

00:11:10.290 --> 00:11:12.790
Can you please autograph it for me.

00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:13.880
Autograph?

00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:15.730
For those iTunes cards...

00:11:15.730 --> 00:11:17.570
that was just used...

00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:20.690
I'd like you to sign them... You can ignore the new cards.

00:11:20.690 --> 00:11:21.390
Oh uh.. eh...

00:11:21.390 --> 00:11:23.050
These used up (dead) iTunes cards?

00:11:23.050 --> 00:11:25.350
Why would you want me to sign these?

00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:27.160
I’ll make them a present.

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:28.780
Is that even possible?

00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:31.040
A: It is! It is! It is!
S: Is that even possible?

00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:33.160
Even if it's a used up card or whatever...

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:35.400
The winners would want to frame it...

00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:37.320
And make it into a prized possession!

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:40.010
If it's something like signing, I can definitely do that.

00:11:40.010 --> 00:11:40.510
Oh.

00:11:40.510 --> 00:11:41.830
Thank you.

00:11:41.830 --> 00:11:42.360
These...

00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:46.170
Signed used iTunes cards and.

00:11:46.170 --> 00:11:46.670
Yes.

00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:48.440
The unused cards.

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:48.920
Yes..

00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:50.210
We'd like to make it as presents for everyone!

00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:51.470
Oooh!.

00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:53.010
The way to apply is...

00:11:53.010 --> 00:11:56.580
Follow the official Twitter of Ordinal Strata

00:11:56.580 --> 00:11:59.610
And tweet or retweet about the present usage...

00:11:59.610 --> 00:12:01.830
You'll have finished your application.

00:12:01.830 --> 00:12:03.220
The announcement for the winners will be

00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:05.740
announced through Twitter DMs.

00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:06.440
The details will..

00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:09.270
Be here so please take a look at the description!

00:12:09.270 --> 00:12:10.430
Perfect! So with this..

00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:12.280
I'm also a Youtuber, right?

00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:14.640
Yes! You're a Youtuber too.

00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:18.170
I've really come to realize the scariness of doing gachas with my own eyes.

00:12:18.170 --> 00:12:19.390
Kind of like...

00:12:19.390 --> 00:12:20.840
I've done gachas but,

00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:23.350
Have I passed along the appeal properly I wonder?

00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:24.610
You definitely passed it!

00:12:24.610 --> 00:12:25.170
See...

00:12:25.170 --> 00:12:28.170
There's been a lot of characters that have been shown and...

00:12:28.170 --> 00:12:30.580
You can also get autographs...

00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:31.570
It'll be fine!

00:12:31.570 --> 00:12:33.240
It'll... Be okay! (?)

00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:34.420
And so!

00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:35.380
The we have spinned...

00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:37.050
for about 12 times right?

00:12:37.050 --> 00:12:39.180
That's right! Around 12 times.

00:12:39.180 --> 00:12:41.520
And each time you get 20 quarts per!.

00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:43.120
We'll be giving these out as presents..

00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:45.700
It's quite a gift isn't it?

00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:46.270
Right?

00:12:46.270 --> 00:12:48.040
If everyone can enjoy it...

00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:49.340
Because it's the real thing!

00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:50.150
With that being said...

00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:51.740
Today was...

00:12:51.740 --> 00:12:53.370
Ordinal Strata!

00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:55.030
Yes! And so,

00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:57.800
This was Virtual Youtuber Kizuna Ai and..

00:12:57.800 --> 00:12:58.350
Eh...

00:12:58.350 --> 00:13:01.330
Voice actress Uesaka Sumire!

00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:03.450
Bye bye!

00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:07.230
