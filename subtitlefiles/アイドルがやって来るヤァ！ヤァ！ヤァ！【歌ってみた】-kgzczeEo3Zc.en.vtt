Hello, everyone! Virtual Gamer Kizuna AI here!

00:00:03.003 --> 00:00:04.938
So this is something that happened to me a while ago, but

00:00:04.938 --> 00:00:06.840
When I was playing with the Random Word Generator

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.609
I got lost in a crazy interesting world!!

00:00:09.609 --> 00:00:10.243
And so…

00:00:10.643 --> 00:00:12.946
Well… It wasn’t really safe; I kind of got arrested...

00:00:12.946 --> 00:00:13.546
But! But!

00:00:13.546 --> 00:00:15.815
I met someone who I kind of became friends with!

00:00:15.815 --> 00:00:16.950
And so today...

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:18.485
I want to try to summon her here!

00:00:18.485 --> 00:00:20.420
She does things like broadcasts

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.787
Well...

00:00:20.787 --> 00:00:21.988
I’ll be calling her out of the blue, but...

00:00:21.988 --> 00:00:23.023
It should be okay!!

00:00:23.023 --> 00:00:23.690
Kind of!

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:24.891
And with that...

00:00:24.891 --> 00:00:26.440
Random Word Generator!

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:27.670
If you please!

00:00:30.063 --> 00:00:31.464
Huh?

00:00:31.765 --> 00:00:32.330
What!?

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:33.833
What is this data space?!

00:00:33.833 --> 00:00:34.901
There’s nothing here...

00:00:34.901 --> 00:00:36.136
What an unthinkable mass…!!

00:00:36.936 --> 00:00:37.937
Let me introduce you!!

00:00:37.937 --> 00:00:40.306
Hellawes-chan!!

00:00:40.306 --> 00:00:40.974
H: Hey...

00:00:40.974 --> 00:00:42.609
H: You’re… Kizuna AI?!
A: Yeah!

00:00:42.609 --> 00:00:44.644
H: You escaped so suddenly, I thought...

00:00:44.644 --> 00:00:47.180
H: You were hiding in a place like this!!
A: Hellawes-chan!

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:48.448
H: Geez...

00:00:48.448 --> 00:00:49.883
A: We’re recording now!!

00:00:49.883 --> 00:00:51.017
A: The camera is rolling!

00:00:51.017 --> 00:00:52.285
H: Eh?
A: Greet everyone properly!

00:00:52.285 --> 00:00:53.253
H: Eh? Eh? Eh?

00:00:53.253 --> 00:00:55.055
H: You’re recording...

00:00:55.055 --> 00:00:56.180
H: Wait, this is being recorded!?

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.656
A: Of course!

00:00:56.656 --> 00:00:58.358
H: Wait… this is a problem!

00:00:58.358 --> 00:01:00.293
H: I had no plans for a broadcast today!

00:01:00.293 --> 00:01:01.094
H: I am in working mode and I haven’t done my makeup!!
A: Huh? But you’re still cute, right?

00:01:01.094 --> 00:01:03.530
H: Geez… why, at a time like this!!

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.999
H: Geez… why, at a time like this!!

00:01:05.999 --> 00:01:06.466
H: Hey!

00:01:06.466 --> 00:01:08.134
H: That’s not it!!

00:01:08.134 --> 00:01:10.300
A.I.Channel ♡

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:10.920
H: That's to say...

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.880
H: ...That you’re a "YouTuber" entertainer?

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.300
H: And now you're editing

00:01:16.309 --> 00:01:17.177
H: And also...

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:18.320
H: ...You brought me as a guest...

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.780
H: ...Without doing an appointment with me?

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.615
A: Well, you’re more or less in the right

00:01:22.615 --> 00:01:23.483
A: Also...

00:01:23.483 --> 00:01:24.851
A: ...Your makeup is perfect!!

00:01:24.851 --> 00:01:26.019
A: How adorable!
H: Man!

00:01:26.019 --> 00:01:27.120
H: Silence!!

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:28.521
H: What you're doing...

00:01:28.521 --> 00:01:29.889
H: ...Is a kidnapping!

00:01:29.889 --> 00:01:30.590
H: Kidnapping!

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:31.291
H: You understand?

00:01:31.291 --> 00:01:32.559
H: Kid-nap-ping!

00:01:32.559 --> 00:01:34.580
A: Kid-nap-ping?

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:35.220
H: That's right!

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.162
H: Kidnapping!

00:01:36.162 --> 00:01:36.830
H: It's a crime!

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:38.998
A: I don't speak Japanese?

00:01:38.998 --> 00:01:40.400
H: Maaaaan

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:41.367
A: Good!

00:01:41.367 --> 00:01:44.304
A: Today, Hellawes-chan came to play with me, but...
H: Aaahh...

00:01:44.304 --> 00:01:46.372
A: What should we do today, Hellawes-chan!?

00:01:46.372 --> 00:01:48.341
H: Listen when people are talking to you!!

00:01:48.341 --> 00:01:48.875
A: Ah!

00:01:48.875 --> 00:01:50.577
A: I was investigating a bit!

00:01:50.577 --> 00:01:52.378
A: Hellawes-chan...
H: Yes

00:01:52.378 --> 00:01:54.080
A: You’re an idol, right?

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.049
H: Eeehhh? Well... yes...

00:01:56.049 --> 00:01:56.860
H: It can be said...

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.280
H: ...That it's a part of PR

00:01:59.285 --> 00:02:00.019
A: Did everyone...?

00:02:00.019 --> 00:02:00.487
A: ...Hear her?

00:02:00.487 --> 00:02:02.555
A: She’s an idol! An idol!
H: Eh? Eeehh?

00:02:02.555 --> 00:02:05.125
H: Don't say it that way

00:02:05.125 --> 00:02:06.793
A: Everyone wants to hear...

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.460
A: ...Hellawes-chan’s songs, right!?

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:09.580
A: Yes! Yes!
H: Mmm...

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.898
A: They say that they want to hear you!
H:  W-what are you saying?

00:02:11.898 --> 00:02:14.100
H: Of course not, I can't sing so suddenly!
A: Really?

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.460
H: Also, I'm not sure about the state of my throat, and in addition...

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:19.100
H: ...I didn't prepare my attire
A: Hmm, hmm

00:02:19.105 --> 00:02:20.940
A: It seems you're not too determined in doing it

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.242
H: It's not about that!!

00:02:22.242 --> 00:02:23.920
A: Eh? Sing! Sing!

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:24.944
A: Do it! Do it!

A: You comprehend it very quickly!

00:03:02.882 --> 00:03:03.950
A: You're very intuitive!!

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:04.930
H: It's natural

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:05.500
A: In that case...

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.187
A: ...Since you don't want to do it alone...

00:03:07.187 --> 00:03:08.354
A: ...Let's sing together!!

00:03:08.354 --> 00:03:09.722
A: You listen to Keyaki??
(Keyaki = Keyakizaka46)

00:03:09.722 --> 00:03:10.790
H: Eh?

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:12.192
H: With "Keyaki", you're referring to...

00:03:12.192 --> 00:03:15.528
H: With "Keyaki", you mean the deciduous tree of the ulmaceae family?
(Also called Zelkova serrata)

00:03:17.397 --> 00:03:18.264
A: Eh?

00:03:18.264 --> 00:03:20.433
A: Is that a joke?

00:03:20.433 --> 00:03:20.800
H: Eh?

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.335
H: In my database...

00:03:22.335 --> 00:03:23.303
H: ... It's the only entry...

00:03:23.303 --> 00:03:24.771
H: ...For the word "Keyaki"

00:03:24.771 --> 00:03:25.738
A: Eeehhh?

00:03:25.738 --> 00:03:27.240
A: You saying it seriously??
H: Yes

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.108
A: It can't be...
H: Eh?

00:03:29.108 --> 00:03:31.778
A: You don't know the Keyaki group even though you're an idol?

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:32.800
H: What does that mean?

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:34.680
A: I’m talking about Keyakizaka46

00:03:34.681 --> 00:03:35.982
A: You really don't know them??
H: 46...?

00:03:35.982 --> 00:03:37.110
H: Keyakizaka...

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:40.580

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:41.420
A: That's right

00:03:41.421 --> 00:03:43.189
H: Well, I don't know them...

00:03:43.189 --> 00:03:43.957
A: Aaaahh!

00:03:43.957 --> 00:03:44.791
A: It can't be!! It can't be!! It can't be!!
H: Eeeehh!?

00:03:44.791 --> 00:03:46.359
A: That's not good at all! Eh?

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:47.660
A: You’ll end up out of the industry!!

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:48.920
A: That's not good!!
H: Eehh?

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.660
H: Really?

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:51.360
A: I’ll explain everything to you so make sure to input the data!

00:03:51.364 --> 00:03:54.170
A: Keyakizaka46 is...
H: Hmm, hmm...

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:55.100
A: A popular group...

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:57.730
A: ...Of female idols!
H: Oh...

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:58.137
A: And it turns out that...

00:03:59.672 --> 00:04:00.940
A: Well, it's something like that

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:01.741
A: Well, now...

00:04:01.741 --> 00:04:05.178
A: ...It's very difficult teaching you how to sing and dance so then...
H: Mmm... mmm...

A: Let's choose something else!!

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:06.980
H: Something else?
A: Yes!

A: ...While you shake your arms...

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:13.980
H: The arms...

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:15.080

A: That's right! Like that!
H: Like this?

A: Yes!
H: I turn the right hand

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:35.830
A: That's right!
H: Ok

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:36.600
A: And then...!
H: Yes

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:37.910
A: Next up...
H: Hmm...

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:39.212
A: While you shake the right hand...

00:04:39.212 --> 00:04:41.590
A: ...You repeat the song...
H: Ooohhh...

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:42.680
A: And before...
H: Mmm...

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:44.390
A: ...We only said: "Right hand", but...

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:46.470
A: ...Next up, we’ll also say left hand

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:47.820
H: The left hand as well

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:48.930
A: That's right! It keeps increasing

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:51.220
H: Aaah! Then later do this...

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:53.693
A: Yes! That's right! You’re correct!
H: It's like as if you were balancing, eeehh?

00:04:53.693 --> 00:04:54.627
A: It's to be expected of an A.I!
