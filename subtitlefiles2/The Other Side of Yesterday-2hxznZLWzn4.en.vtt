00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.900
Hello there

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:39.600
Iris?

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:42.340
Do I know you?

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.980
What is this?

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:45.740
I know you're confused

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:46.820
but don't worry

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:48.460
I'll explain everything

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:50.020
Who are you?

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:52.280
My name is Kellen

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:55.120
And I've been looking for you

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.700
Why am I here again?

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:07.980
The museum?

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.980
Yes

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.120
I was here yesterday

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:13.360
Why am I back again?

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.520
You were at the museum

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.000
But you've never been to this place, Iris

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:24.180
This place?

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.480
Well, different people call it different things

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:31.680
But I think the best answer to that is a simple one

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.640
This is. Yesterday.

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:36.600
What do you mean?

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.580
One day into the past.

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.540
That's impossible.

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.880
Everything is impossible, until you experience it.

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.060
Iris, what do you know about time travel?

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:05.460
Truth is we've all experienced it

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.000
Time travel is every day

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.640
People spend theirs lives traveling from one day to the next.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.460
Yesterday to today, today to tomorrow.

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.140
I mean if you think about it

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.580
Isn't living itself, essentially traveling through time.

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.960
Imagine each grain of sand as a person

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:30.460
This is everyone migrating from one day, to the next.

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.540
See how this space is pretty much empty now?

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:38.900
That's because almost everyone has moved on to the next day

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.160
Almost everyone?

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.260
That's me?

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.060
Okay, even if I did believe you.

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.740
How did I end up here? Get left behind.

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:55.920
It happens

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.600
Not a lot, but it happens.

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.600
So there have been others? I'm not the only one?

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.040
Everyone I've met here, has a different story.

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.880
Some people choose to live in the past.

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.920
And others can't escape their fear of the future

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.260
Some, are just simply lost.

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:19.720
I think I know the feeling.

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:21.340
Which one?

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:23.780
All of them.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:31.460
Iris, why did you come to the museum yesterday?

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.720
I just wanted to finish our day.

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.000
It's been two years since the accident.

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.040
And they're all gone.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.120
Mom, Dad, Alex.

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.140
Why not me?

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:49.880
What happened?

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:55.100
It was raining,

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:57.320
really hard that day.

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.720
And we were on our way to the museum.

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:02.760
This.

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:05.400
This museum.

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:10.900
And then,

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:13.340
out of no where

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.440
a car hits us from the side.

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:20.360
My dad loses control of the car and we crash.

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:27.540
The next thing I know, I woke up in the hospital.

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.260
And I was alone.

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:34.500
I came here yesterday,

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.500
to know how it could've been.

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:39.920
How it should've been.

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:44.980
I just wanted to finish our day.

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.780
I was the last thing to do before I...

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:58.660
*ahem* Did it. Did it help you to revisit?

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:02.800
They're still gone.

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:05.520
Nothing will change that.

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:10.920
And now, I'm stranded in this empty void.

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:13.780
You're not stranded.

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:16.320
That's why I'm here.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.200
I'll get you back.

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:37.980
No one is ever really gone.

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:42.460
As long as they're remembered, they live on.

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:47.580
That includes your family.

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:51.040
Thank you.

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:55.980
These stairs will take you where you need to be.

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:00.320
Just, straight ahead?

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:01.960
That's it?

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:03.420
That's it.

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:18.400
There's nothing for me on the other side.

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:21.780
What if I stay here?

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:26.140
Living in yesterday won't bring you closer to your family Iris.

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:28.740
You will see them again.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.940
But not with your eyes looking back.

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:34.000
I don't know if I can do that.

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:38.000
Everything is impossible, until you experience it.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.760
We're all time travelers,

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:47.620
even though our paths are unique and the challenges presented.

00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:49.420
One truth remains constant.

00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:52.340
What's to come tomorrow?

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.240
What's left behind in yesterday?

00:07:55.980 --> 00:07:58.560
It's all determined by what we do today.
