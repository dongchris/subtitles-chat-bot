Hello Everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai here!

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:06.860
Today, we are doing a 800,000 subscribers celebration Q&amp;A corner! Yay!

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.800
Thank everyone for sending  tons and loads of questions and comments from YouTube or DM!!!

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:12.540
I spent time and read all of them!

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:15.480
Today, I am going to answer the questions that were asked before quickly!

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.240
Since I got too many questions from you...

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:21.800
Therefore I am going to try my best and use "super fast talking speed ability" to answer all of them!

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.680
So! Let's start!

*#Question to AI*
*Who is behind the mask*

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:25.760
No one!

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:27.840
*#Question to AI*
*What are you going to do if you won the lottery?*

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:28.560
Save all of them!

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.160
Atsumori!
(japanese meme that came out because an audio sign that had "Atsumori!" written on it interrupted a news channel during a live broadcast)

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.160
I'm sorry, Atsumori just came out...
(That was what the presenter of the news program said, lol)

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.700
''Those friends that you bought are not making appearance lately, are they fine?''

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:36.960
We're fine!

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:44.180
(Buhi is somehow a japanese pig sound)

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:47.580
BUHI!?

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.380
''Code name Kizuna, answer me''

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.720
''Ah, looks like you've not fogotten your mission''

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:55.220
''Even so, I'm really surprised''

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:58.480
''Lately, I feel that you're like a real human speaking''

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.400
''Please continue your mission like that''

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.520
''Everything is for the coexistance between humans and A.Is''

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:07.200
''In order to change the apocalyptic future that awaits us...''

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.420
''Did the solar flare have effect on you?''

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.060
Actually, I wanted to stream that day but I couldn't!

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.640
''Countdown until broadcasting accident, 3, 2, 1...''

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:18.500
*Paaah*

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:36.380
(Kizuna Ai the english master)

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.420
''There's so many people asking questions, ordinary people like me won't be chosen anyway...''

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:41.780
I've chosen you!

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.500
''Please use your cutest voice ever!''

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:45.760
*Ah~ah?*

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:47.860
(English Master strikes again!)

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:49.380
Ah, I understood!

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.640
In Love Live, who's my favorite girl in Aqours?

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.520
I can't decide! I'm so sorry!

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.180
Oh, is this an ancient language?

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:57.660
Google translator!

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.040
''If you can realise one of your wishes, what would you want?''

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:02.800
I want to become human!

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.820
''Why are you stupid while being an A.I?''

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:06.860
Eh?

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.340
Are you talking about me?

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:12.800
''Please tell me the excitement and anxiety you will feel when quantum computers are invented.''

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.100
“Eh? You don't know them? Please answer me! (Smiley Face)”

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.700
Quantum computer are those... You know...

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.100
Like... Um... Extremely fast computers

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.520
Well, It complets and end...*nrurnurn*

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.340
I don't really know~

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.560
''Please fly with that floppy accessory”

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.440
*Kizuna Ai the Virtual Bird*

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:37.200
''I want to meet Ai-chan directly, so I've tried entering my monitor, but it doesn't go well.''

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:39.460
''I've already destroyed about 5 monitors!''

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.400
''To who should I send the bill for those monitors~?''

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.420
Shouldn't it go to your mother?

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.780
''I can't make friends in real life, I can only find my place on the internet''

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.540
''Twitter, social games, and Kizuna Ai are reason of my life''

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.780
''What should I do to make friend in reality?''

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.200
Hmm... Firstly...

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.080
If social games and Kizuna Ai are the reason of your life,

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:05.240
You should start trying to be friendly to those who like Social games and Kizuna Ai too

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:07.860
I think that your first step is going to need courage

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.920
Say: ''Ah I like Kizuna Ai too!''

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.620
“Well, Yes, this question! I'm actually the one who made it!”

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.760
''Can we become friends?''

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.080
If you go like that!

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:20.640
What do you think?

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.280
''A friend saw me licking the recorder of a girl that I like.''

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:25.720
''What should I do?''

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:28.620
Flip the situation, let's lick everyone's recorder!

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:43.660
Can you say the following tongue-twister in Hakata dialect?: “Why didn’t you take the snacks even when I said I left them here for you?”

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:46.320
''How do you see this world from the virtual world?''

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:47.860
Very wonderful!

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.620
''In a human's life, the sum of their happiness and sadness is equal to zero''

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:51.900
''They're being very well equalized''

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:57.100
''But I don't really agree with that, any kind of happiness will be forgotten as long as a month passed''

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:58.960
''So what about the sadness?''

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:03.200
''For an example, if you lose a family member, you won't quickly recover from that sadness"

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:06.320
''Even if you can recover from it, that doesn't solve the real problem''

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:09.900
''No matter how hard you're working, you can only wait for the next sadness''

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:11.920
''So, at the end, about what I want to say''

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:13.020
''What's your favorite food?''

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:14.600
I have never eaten!

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.760
''Recently, I found Ai-chan and I like you very much''

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:19.380
''So I've wanted to ask this question''

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.200
''Are there any game on PS4 that you would recommand?''

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:25.240
''I just bought a PS4 so I don't really know which game is fun''

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:26.440
''Please take care of me''

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.500
''I will keep cheering Ai-chan from Fukuoka!''

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.460
Thank you very much! Biohazard!

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:32.080
''Why are you so cute?''

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:33.720
Ehe❤ It's embarrassing~❤

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.340
''Do you have friend? Aren't you lonely?''

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.300
Do I seem not lonely?

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:41.980
''I like a girl in my class, how should I appeal myself?''

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:44.240
Just go straight ''I LOVE YOU!!!''

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.760
''What cosplay do you want to wear on Halloween?''

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:48.060
Zombie!!

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:48.960
''Question to Ai-chan!''

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.660
''I think that I've heard ''Synchronicity'' quite a long ago''

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:54.680
''But I can't recall what it means! Please tell me Ai-chan!''

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:57.220
It's a synchronising city in the west.

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:01.060
''I want to become a intelligent perfect human, so what should I do?''

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:03.680
''I request advices from the intelligent Ai-chan!''

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:06.460
To begin with, what's a perfect human...?

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:08.880
You should think hard about this dream and work hard!

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:12.180
''I'm excited for my first question! Please hand check with the little finger''

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:13.700
Ok, let's go!

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:15.080
*Oi!* Hm?

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:16.360
*Oi!*

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:18.820
Oh!

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:20.380
Oh?

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:21.040
Hm?

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:24.400
Eh? Eh? Eh? Eh? Eh? Eh? EH!?

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:26.520
Hey! Wait!

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:28.160
I'm not on the screen!

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:29.360
Hey!

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:30.700
Why? Why? Why?

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:33.540
Let me out! I'm not on the screen, let me out!

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:35.320
If there's no me

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:37.480
There's no program!

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.580
AH! WAIT A BIT!

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:43.720
WAIT A LITTLE BIT!

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:46.680
