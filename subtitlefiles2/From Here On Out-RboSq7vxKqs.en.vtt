00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:18.600
You can tell a lot about a person's life 
based on what they buy at the market.

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:20.780
Who's having a big party,

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:23.300
or a lonely one.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:25.600
Who's on a diet,

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.500
or who's about to have a special day.

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:31.500
I notice all these things.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.800
It's gonna be... forty dollars.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:53.100
Hey James!

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.400
I'm gonna take my fifteen,
can you cover the rest of my line?

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.800
-Oh yeah yeah, sure sure.
-Thanks.

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:02.720
Hi.

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:04.040
Hi!

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.200
Thank you, Lynn.

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.920
-Have a nice day!
-You too.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Oh, so that's how you got my name.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.900
No, well, we're required to say
"Thank You" to the customers by name.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:23.660
Mm-hmm.

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.380
Really, it's suppose to make
your shopping experience more personal.

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.460
Well, you certainly made
my shopping experience...

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.440
personal, these last few weeks.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.300
Hey, I'm just,
helping a customer to her car.

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.400
And always taking an extra
ten-minute break on the clock.

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.560
You park really, really far.

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:51.800
(chuckles)

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:55.720
So, what did my items tell you about me?

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.800
I sort of figured, um,
you and your boyfriend...

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.500
I mean, you started,

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:22.600
buying all these frozen dinners and,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.300
that usually means...

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:27.280
Argh...

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.000
Uh, I'm uh...

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.800
I'm–I'm sorry I wasn't,
trying to be a creep about it.

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.800
I–I promise.

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:34.320
No it's okay.

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:36.860
That's just interesting

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.700
to hear how I come off
to someone who doesn't know me.

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.000
Is it weird if I, feel like I do know you?

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.800
There's still a lot you don't.

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:51.560
Yeah well I feel like these,

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.320
talks we have every so often,

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:54.460
might change that.

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.300
Um, thank you for your help.

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:01.800
-Yeah yeah, of course.
-I should probably get going so...

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.300
you don't get fired.

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:05.200
See you next time.

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:07.740
Yeah.

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:10.280
Hello.

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:24.460
Would you like some help to your car?

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.000
-Since, your wrist?
-Um, I think I'll be okay.

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.760
You sure? You got, all these drinks,
you don't want to risk it.

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:34.980
Alright, thank you.

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.180
Yeah, I messed up my wrist last year.

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:40.780
Doing this human pyramid.

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:42.940
Totally worth it though,
we had like, five levels going.

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.100
First time snowboarding for me.

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:46.500
-Ouch!
-Yeah.

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:48.380
I'm James, by the way.

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.920
Lynn.

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.360
Okay, so what's the coolest place
you've ever heard of?

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:02.060
There's these caves in Mexico,

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:05.260
that are so deep they have, like,
clouds in them.

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:07.200
-Wow.
-Yeah.

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:09.000
You should go see them.

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:10.900
I don't know, I–

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:12.500
I have to work and,

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:14.640
it's pretty difficult to get to.

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:17.600
That's exactly why I would go.

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:19.420
No, you don't understand. I got–

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:22.380
No, there's so much to see out there.

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:24.820
Would you want to go with me?

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:27.420
Um,

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:29.480
maybe.

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:31.520
All I'm saying is,

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:36.200
we don't need groceries to be
the only reason to see each other.

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:37.360
Right?

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:41.100
Are you... asking me out?

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:43.620
Yea because,

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:45.140
you know, I like you.

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.100
I... like you, too.

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:53.860
I do...

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:57.700
but I don't really feel ready yet.

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:37.000
Hey James.

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:39.400
Oh hey, Lynn. What's up?

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:41.000
Almost done here.

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:46.200
I think I'm gonna leave.

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:47.800
Okay, I can ring you up.

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:50.320
I mean I'm moving away.

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:52.640
What?

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:56.060
Where?

00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:58.860
Wait, why?

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:01.320
Yea, I don't know where yet.

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:04.380
I just know I need to get out of the city.

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:06.300
How come?

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:08.760
Is everything okay?

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:10.440
Yeah.

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:13.000
Um, it's just...

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:19.900
when you told a few weeks ago
that you liked me, I realized something.

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:22.100
You're not ready.

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:23.800
That's totally fine.

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:25.940
I didn't mean to freak you out.

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:27.300
No, I know.

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:30.780
I want to be ready...

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:35.200
I thought I would be by now but that's,

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:37.420
not gonna happen if I stay here.

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:41.980
There's too much that reminds me of him.

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:43.300
Well,

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:46.540
moving away won't...

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:50.240
change that, wherever you go,
your memories go with you.

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:52.660
Yeah, I know.

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:55.240
That's why they call it baggage because,

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:57.500
you carry it with you wherever you go!

00:06:57.700 --> 00:06:58.800
You don't understand.

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:01.520
It's not just baggage. I can handle that.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.360
This is just a feeling I need to follow.

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:07.300
How is, running away
from your problems going to solve that?

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:09.400
That's taking the easy way out.

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:11.900
You're right, James.

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:13.560
I'm weak because I run.

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:14.400
Yeah!

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:17.300
Yeah, I should be more like you. Just...

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:19.000
stay exactly where I am,

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:20.700
Register 3.

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:25.540
You don't know anything about me.

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:26.280
Sure.

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:29.660
But, you bag a few frozen dinners and,

00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:33.680
help me to my car a few times
and assume you have me all figured out?

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:45.640
Everyone comes here looking for...

00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:47.400
something,

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:52.420
but that doesn't mean
they always find what they need.

00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:55.400
I don't know where she went but,

00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:58.900
That was last time she came to the market.

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:10.420
Oh hey, James!

00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:12.800
-Yeah?
-You got a package.

00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:15.440
What?

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:17.300
Yeah, it was really weird. They, um,

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:19.300
sent to the store but
your name was on it. Um...

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:20.700
oh here it is.

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:00.740
"Hi James.

00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:04.320
Let me start by saying, I'm sorry.

00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:09.100
I'm sorry our last conversation
ended the way it did.

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:14.920
I was disappointed in myself
and frustrated.

00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:17.800
I never meant to hurt you with my words.

00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:19.680
I hope you know that.

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:23.000
I know I disappeared
without resolving things.

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:26.700
Like I said, I just had to leave.

00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:29.500
But, I didn't know where.

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:31.500
So I just...

00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:33.720
went.

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:48.160
And over the last few months,

00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:53.940
I found myself in some of the most
amazing places I never thought I'd see.

00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:57.700
And I wanted to share them with you.

00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:05.720
The red sand is from the Grand Canyon.

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:11.360
The moss is from
an incredible waterfall in Oregon.

00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:14.880
I packed some snow
from a glacier in Canada,

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.000
but it's probably water now.

00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:20.120
Oh!

00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:21.900
And the bottle that looks empty,

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:23.860
that one's my favorite.

00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:29.140
It's actually some of the cloud from
that cave in Mexico you told me about.

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:31.660
It was beautiful!

00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:35.600
James, I need you to do something for me.

00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:40.360
I need you to return all these things
to where they came from.

00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:42.520
I know it sounds crazy

00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:46.360
and I know all your reasons
not to go, but I promise...

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:50.900
this can far more
than just a box of bottles if you let it.

00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:54.400
You gave me a friendship during...

00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:56.000
a very difficult time,

00:10:56.900 --> 00:10:58.800
and this is my way of saying...

00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:00.280
Thanks.

00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:04.400
I don't know when or where
we'll see each other again.

00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:08.100
All I know is, when we do,

00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:11.700
we'll both have grown in ways
we never expected.

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:16.400
And that's an adventure worth taking,
don't you think?"

00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:02.420
Thanks for watching, guys!

00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:04.440
I hope you liked that little adventure
that we took you on.

00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:06.760
And also thanks to Vitasoy,
for making this happen.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:08.360
We've been wanting to tell this story

00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:10.220
for a while and it was really great
to partner with them.

00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:12.000
And this was especially nice because,

00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:13.400
I remember growing up with this,

00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:15.780
I used to drink Vitasoy
when I was a little kid and,

00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:19.000
I still do, so it was kinda nice
to have it come full circle like that.

00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:20.700
Well, we hope you guys enjoyed it,

00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:22.120
subscribe for more short films and,

00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:23.600
-we'll see you guys next time!
-Thanks!

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.160
Wes is my boyfriend,

00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:27.400
-Wes is my boyfriend.
-Julie is my girlfriend.

00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:30.280
-Damn, and then he dumps me and I cry.
-No no no, no no-

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:32.460
I'm more chill today,
I'm wearing a T-shirt instead.

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:33.960
-It looked like you got demoted,
-Yeah.

00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:35.120
-from yesterday.
-It sucks man.

00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:36.380
-It's because you keep-
-I know!

00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:38.600
-taking these long breaks. Yeah.
-I keep hanging out with this girl.

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:41.000
She's like, forcing me
to carry her groceries to her car.

00:12:41.140 --> 00:12:43.340
I know, they got cameras. You don't think
they don't see you just like-

00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:45.300
See that's why,
you're leaking this information!
