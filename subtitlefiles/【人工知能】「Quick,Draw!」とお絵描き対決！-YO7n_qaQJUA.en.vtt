00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.960
Hello, everyone.

00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:02.740
It's me, virtual Youtuber, Kizuna Ai.

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:05.120
Today we're gonna play this.
[Quick, Draw!]

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:08.840
You see,
This is a game related to A.I. like me.

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:14.000
You get 20 seconds to draw an illustration of the given topic to let Google's A.I. guess what it is.

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:16.160
I'll let you see for yourselves rather than explaining all of it.

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:18.240
Then, Let's Draw!

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:21.880
Cla... ri...

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:23.460
Clarinet!

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.800
♬Clarinet that I got from my papa~♬

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.300
Isn't clarinet something that looks like a recorder?

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.240
It had holes too... Clarinet....
(A.I. thinking processing...)

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:36.020
(A.I. thinking processing...)

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.120
Oh, it was something that you press, right? Clarinet....
(A.I. thinking processing...)

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:39.280
(A.I. thinking processing...)

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:39.840
Like... so...

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.040
A.I. "Oh I know, it's clarinet!"
Like... so...

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:42.920
It was like this, right?
OH!

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.560
This is it, we have it here.

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:46.160
G... Golf...

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:47.320
Golf club!

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:50.400
Piece of cake.

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:53.040
Wah!

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Candle.

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.900
Wait, isn't this super easy

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:00.740
I won't really feel accomplished but I'll do it anyway.

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.360
Look at me go,
I was genious from the start.

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.440
Camo... hu... la... ge

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:08.660
Ka... cya... cya

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:09.800
Cyamo? Kyamo?

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.680
Camou...

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:12.500
hu...

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.660
Camouflage! Camouflage.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.240
Camouflage!

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:19.020
Camouflage...

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:21.780
lot of grass...

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:24.260
growing...

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.980
Put a sheet down here...

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.780
Like this... like it's blending in with the background...

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.360
Just guess it already.

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.240
Isn't this A.I. stupid?

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:39.840
Oh, did I get it?

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:41.620
A...m...

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.580
"Ambalance."

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:46.660
A...am...

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:47.540
b...

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.000
"Unbalance"(?)

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.560
"Unbalance" is...?

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.120
Un...balan.

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.940
Unbalance.

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:56.840
How is it,
it's unbalanced.

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.080
How is it? Ta da!

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.880
Ah, this A.I. is rubbish.

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:01.380
Useless...

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.060
He... Helico...

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.160
Helicopter!

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.440
Heli... copter...

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:10.560
It's like this, right?

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:12.320
Oh?

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.940
Ohh~

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:15.480
Oh! Ah!

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.840
Eh? Camouflage was no good.

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.160
Hey, but it's still a decent score, isn't it?

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.560
4 out of 6 correct.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.860
Also, if you click one of these...

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.500
You can see what the others

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.040
...have drawn.

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.860
What are these?

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:33.400
Garbage?

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:35.780
Yeah, this is garbage, definitely.

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:37.640
Unbalance is...

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.800
Oh!

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.020
[X Unbalance]
[O Ambulance]

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:41.360
Ambulance!
[X Unbalance]
[O Ambulance]

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:42.340
Well, I did that on purpose.

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:45.340
Someone could hate me
if I got all of it in the first go.

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:46.540
Let's do this again.

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.040
This round is going to be the perfect round.

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:48.840
Tree.

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:50.240
It's tree. Tree.

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.100
This is easy peasy.

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:55.400
Here, tree.

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:58.980
Eh?

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:00.740
Tree!

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.060
This is tree. No matter how you look at it!

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.720
It's tree, right? Tree!

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:07.520
Potato, potato...

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:10.700
Potato....

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:12.160
Oh~

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.340
Post... postcard...

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.280
Isn't postcard more difficult than the other ones?

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:19.900
Postcard?

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.280
Eh, postcard...

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.260
Is this no good?

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:26.820
Postcar...

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:28.220
Alright, alright, alright.

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.300
Whulip... whulo... Whulops.

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:34.240
Like a whiteboard?

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:35.780
Whlip...

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:38.380
Whiteboard...

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.060
How's this.

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.040
It's a whiteboard. A whiteboard.

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:46.840
This is a whiteboard. A whiteboard.

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.020
Hello?
Anyone there?

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.840
Yep.

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.420
Bi... bildo?

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:53.000
Bir... Bildo...

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:55.720
Bur... bi...

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:57.620
Buildo.

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:00.720
Buildo... Building(!?)

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:04.420
If I say building, it's building.

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.180
It's a building~

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:09.340
Hello?

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:13.080
It's a building.

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:16.580
Is this A.I. okay...?(Self damage)

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:18.680
I would like to share some of my intelligence.

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:21.700
Su... Sui... to

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:23.560
Ka... say

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:25.320
Sweet corn. Yep.

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:30.880
Sweet corn~

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:32.640
It's sweet corn.

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:34.220
Hello?

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:35.860
It's corn.

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:37.480
Behold!

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.100
I got only 1 out of 6 right.

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:41.900
Eh? Tree was...

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:43.640
This is... tree.

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:46.180
Wait, wait. My drawing is much superior.

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:48.420
Everyone has drawn these garbage trees...

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:49.920
I mean come on...

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:51.800
What about postcard?

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:54.840
Wait...

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:56.960
Clearly mine is--

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:59.040
is the superior one, is it not?

00:04:59.040 --> 00:04:59.980
Eh?

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:01.260
This is?

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:02.400
Flip...

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:04.240
Ah!

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:05.100
Hm? Wooden sandals?

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:06.420
Slippers!

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:07.500
Flip flops (Rubber sandals with a strap)
Oh, sandals!

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:08.000
Flip flops (Rubber sandals with a strap)

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.400
I see.

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.400
I guess that's one way of viewing it.

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:14.180
This is... ah.

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:15.260
Bird.

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:18.120
(Laughter)

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:20.720
Oh my, my apologies...

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.260
This is definitely my mistake.

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:26.440
Sorry about that.

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:27.940
How about the sweet corn?

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:30.020
What is this, a bag?

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:32.400
A 'bag' is called a bag, isn't it?

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:33.520
Suitcase!

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:35.720
Huh... I see.

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:39.020
Well... I can see that being the case...

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:41.180
Tears... Round 1 of tears.

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:42.780
I'm going to do it!

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:43.840
Pencil!

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:45.500
It's easy. Pencil.

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:46.720
Pencil...

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:52.740
Ohh...

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:54.840
[Flag?]
What's this. Flag, it's a flag, right?

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:56.160
What's this. Flag, it's a flag, right?

00:05:59.200 --> 00:05:59.760
Behold!

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:03.560
This is a flag.

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:06.240
You see... this A.I. is a bit...

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:10.840
Hey... Hey... the entire answer to the question is literally hanging... in front of you.

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:13.580
A... aspa....

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:14.920
Asparagus!

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:23.020
Oh~

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:25.660
Rainbow!

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:29.480
Rainbow's easy. It's a rainbow, a rainbow.

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:30.800
Oh~

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:33.460
Ga...

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:34.720
Garden!

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:36.360
Garden, you say?

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:39.380
Eh? This is a garden.

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:40.580
Hello?

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:42.140
Oh! Oh?

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:43.560
How did I just do?

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:45.180
Hot dog!

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:46.480
Let's go hot dog.

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:52.360
Oh!

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:53.680
Oh

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:56.040
Haah! Eh?

00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:58.220
Flag!

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:00.200
Flag

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:02.880
Ah!

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:04.940
Frog is... called [Frog].

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:07.760
X Flag
O Frog
Frog is... called [Frog].

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:11.200
Well, I got smarter by looking this.

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:14.520
I'm a Japanese... only user.

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:17.240
It's only natural that I can't do English.

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:22.580
This... 5 out of 6 score is an amazing score, everyone.

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:23.740
Okay?

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:25.980
Well I've got nothing to say now...

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:28.240
Yes, I admit. I can't speak English.

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:30.080
I'll study English. English...

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:32.760
Hau ah yuu? Halo?
Naischu meechu?

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:34.400
Now the tears...

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:36.240
Another round of tears... Here we go.

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:37.780
The goal is to get a perfect score.

00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:39.080
Mou...

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:40.400
chi...

00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:41.580
Mo

00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:42.400
u...

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:43.720
Moo...

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:44.440
Cow(!?

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:46.020
It's a cow.

00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:49.260
It said 'mou' so it's cow, cow.

00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:51.840
How's this?

00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:54.260
It's quite a cute...

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:55.860
cow, is it not?

00:07:58.260 --> 00:07:59.880
Was that no good?

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:03.260
Mou! It said mou so it's cow.

00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:06.540
I don't think I can be friends with this A.I.

00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:07.360
Dog!

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:08.100
It's dog.

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:10.580
While I was playing this, I've realized something.

00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:16.340
It's effective to draw rather simply... to a degree to make this A.I. understand.

00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:18.600
How's this?

00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:21.600
Eh? How was that?

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:23.020
Safe, safe.

00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:24.540
Tro...

00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:25.440
Trom....

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:26.260
Toumorokoshi
*Corn

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:27.600
Yep

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:29.440
Second time today.

00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:31.980
We've had sweet corn...

00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:33.020
and now, toumorokoshi...

00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:35.060
It's got this corn beard...

00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:37.780
How is it?

00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:40.240
It's quite a corn, wouldn't you say?

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:43.420
How is it? Ohahow..?

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:45.660
Spi...

00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:46.800
do...

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:48.000
er...

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.420
Su?

00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:50.960
Spi...

00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:52.660
Spi...!

00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:53.900
dwe...

00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:55.840
Speed deru
*Gain speed

00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:56.520
*Gain speed

00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:57.980
Gain speed...
Car(!

00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:00.460
Gain speed = Car

00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:02.460
English is actually pretty simple. (Satisfied)

00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:04.460
Speed deru, they say. Speed deru...

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:08.380
Speed deru!

00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:10.100
How is this?

00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:11.780
It looks speedy, right?

00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:15.400
Eh? Was it no good?

00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:16.500
Croco...

00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:18.300
Crocodile!
It's that.

00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:19.500
The...

00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:20.960
Crocodile

00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:22.860
It's crocodile, crocodile.

00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:24.520
Crocodile!

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.460
Croco...dile...

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.020
Crocodile

00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:37.860
Hey, isn't this cute? In some way...

00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:38.540
(Laughter)

00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:41.460
Crocodile! Was crocodile no good?

00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:44.500
It was crocodile, right?
Crocodile.

00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:45.560
Van.

00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:46.800
Ban.

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:47.640
When people say ban, they're talking about me.

00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:48.640
※Ai's channel was banned
from Youtube not too long ago.
When people say ban, they're talking about me.

00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:49.960
※Ai's channel was banned
from Youtube not too long ago.

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:50.640
Ban...

00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:53.560
So I just need to draw myself.

00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:59.140
If you say ban...
It's Kizuna Ai.

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:09.840
Agh! It's so hard to draw, myself!

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:11.100
Behold!

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:15.440
Shoot!

00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:18.480
Tada.

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:20.500
Wait!
Wait a second.

00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:24.620
I mean...
I admit, there were some strange stuff I drew...

00:10:24.820 --> 00:10:28.480
but crocodile! Isn't this a bit... cute...?

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.280
It's got it's characteristics, has it not?

00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:32.540
Like...

00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:37.620
Why are these... weird... something... lizards are...

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:40.700
These unidentifiable ones are okay...

00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:42.400
but this is not?

00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:45.860
I personally thought this was quite the masterpiece.

00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:49.160
Well, that doesn't mean anything

00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:52.080
In front of these un-artistic...

00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:53.560
How pitiful...

00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:54.640
Spider!

00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:56.980
Was this spider?
What was the topic again?

00:10:57.680 --> 00:10:58.840
Spider... is...

00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:00.040
Spider!

00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:00.800
X Speed deru
O Spider
Spider!

00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:01.780
X Speed deru
O Spider
I see!

00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:02.460
X Speed deru
O Spider

00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:04.860
X Speed deru
O Spider
Ah but isn't it kinda similar?

00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:06.800
The... spider and the car.

00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:09.440
Was my ban wrong too?
BAN

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:10.180
Ah!

00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:12.940
X BAN = Me
O VAN (Locomotive)

00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:14.120
X BAN = Me
O VAN (Locomotive)
Van!

00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:16.040
X BAN = Me
O VAN (Locomotive)
It's a car. Truck...

00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:18.580
Ah... the topic...

00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:21.740
IF these* were in the other's spot...
(*number 4 and 6)

00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:23.220
There could have been a possibility.

00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:25.700
How about toumorokoshi?
Corn...

00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:28.020
Trumpet!?

00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:31.060
Trombone!

00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:31.760
X Toumorokoshi
O Trombone

00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:33.060
X Toumorokoshi
O Trombone
How about cow?

00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:35.940
Hm? Lips?

00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:39.260
Lips? Aren't lips [Lips]?

00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:40.900
Mouth.

00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:42.200
X Mou~ = Cow
O Mouth

00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:43.240
X Mou~ = Cow
O Mouth
Is that so...

00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:43.860
X Mou~ = Cow
O Mouth

00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:45.860
X Mou~ = Cow
O Mouth
Haah... Lemme practice my English.

00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:48.000
Then we'll do a revenge match in a few years.

00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:51.080
I'll be... spitting English like a gatling gun.

00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:53.300
I'm aiming to spread my name all over the world.

00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:54.160
*sob*

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:55.280
Then...

00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:56.840
That's it for today.

00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:59.060
If you like what you saw, definitely give it a go!

00:11:59.060 --> 00:12:01.760
If you get... a perfect score

00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:02.940
I'll...

00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:04.660
clap... for you.

00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:06.060
I'll wait for your response.

00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:08.500
Don't use a translator.
That's cheating.

00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:11.540
Then... Let us meet again someday!
Bye bye!
