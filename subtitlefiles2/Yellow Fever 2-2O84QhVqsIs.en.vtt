00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:08.170
Interracial dating.

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:12.269
Every community can get sensitive when it comes to this hot topic, and ten years ago

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.319
I went to explore the phenomenon known as yellow fever. I was so curious

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.150
why there were more Asian girls going for white guys and not the other way around. Like it was some sort of big deal.

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:26.910
It was a story that resonated with millions of people at the time, and it's hard to believe that ten years have passed.

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:28.779
But looking back,

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:30.779
I've grown so much.

00:00:31.719 --> 00:00:37.409
I learned a lot from that video, and sometimes I like to come back to where it all started, just to remind myself

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:38.790
how far we've come.

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:44.399
Yeah, I've never done an Asian guy before. I mean I feel like they're all the same. It'd be like dating my brother.

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:50.850
You know I really like Asian girls. Check this out.

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:54.380
Ni hao ma?

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:56.300
That's it!

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:03.260
Ten years, and nothing's changed. It's a whole new generation and once again, it's my duty to figure out the age-old question:

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.700
Why are the white guys taking all our girls?

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.700
[Girl laughs]

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.720
[Anime action noises]

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.380
Now, where's my DDR Pad?

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.080
'Scuse me?

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.960
What?

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.840
That t-shirt you're wearing ... It's a little bit racist.

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.940
You can read this?

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:32.240
Uh ... yeah. I took Mandarin for three semesters in college. Plus, they're like teaching Chinese in Elementary schools now, you know?

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.060
No way.

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.060
I also worked in Shanghai for two years.

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.100
Maybe we should be more careful next time.

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.140
Hey babe! Hey!

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.140
Oh. Cool shirt. What does it say?

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.260
So you do have yellow fever!

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:50.500
I'm a third-generation Asian American girl who does not belong to or owe anything to your perception of racial boundaries and expectations.

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.080
[Loud crash]

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.600
Yeah, and besides you act like all of us are abandoning you.

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:04.959
The majority of Asian girls are in relationship with Asian guys.

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.140
I love my Asian boyfriend.

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.340
He's smart, caring, handsome, and we share cultural ties.

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.620
Hey babe, I got our favorite. Taro Milk Tea and Grass Jelly.

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:23.600
[Romantic music]

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:25.740
I love you!

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.120
Is it yellow fever if I'm Asian?

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.420
Bart, back me up here!

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:39.320
About what?

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.739
About not enough Asian guys with non-Asian girls.

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:44.420
What do I know about that?

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:46.080
Well you're Asian.

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.840
I am?

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.960
And Geo's ... Mexican?

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.940
Holy shit! I never realized that, every time I look at you,

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.740
I only see the beautiful things that I love about her.

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.140
I don't see color or anything like that.

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.740
And don't act like we haven't put ourselves out there.

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.580
It's like Asian guys can't handle a strong black female.

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.060
Come on now.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:11.860
Yeah, I love Asian guys.

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:13.280
Only because I'm Asian.

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.340
Oh, so now you don't want to be fetishized?

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.560
Isn't that something you want us to do? Or is that something you're actually doing to us?

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.879
What? No, okay, look ... there's a lot of swinging going on around here.

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:26.580
I'm a little dizzy ...

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:27.640
Then why do you even want to date us anyways?

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.840
Other than just to prove something to yourself, like I'm just a measure of your masculinity.

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.200
No. It's about being equally considered because media ...

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:40.160
Okay, if we have the same interest, lifestyle, sense of humor, taste, then yeah, we'll talk.

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.020
Like any other relationship.

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:44.680
But if I'm just a trophy to you then ...

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:49.340
Okay. So this conversation can get pretty deep and could be a complete short on its own.

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:52.200
But for now, let's move on before we get too carried away.

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:06.279
Look, man. I think it's time to just acknowledge that there are beautiful relationships of all types out there.

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:11.500
Sure, there are some bad examples of racial profiling in the dating world,

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:15.880
and the history of mainstream media's representation of us sucks.

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:19.239
But don't let that make you jaded.

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:25.509
Ultimately, it's up to you to be confident, open-minded and not so angry.

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:33.880
Everyone has their own story and reasons. Who are we to get all riled up about it? Finding love is hard enough.

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:37.089
Why worry about what color that love is?

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:46.550
Wow. That was beautiful, man. Dude, thanks so much, Steve. I've learned so much today.

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:55.848
Really? Ten years later, and no concern for guys like me. Haha, wow.

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:01.339
Hey guys, I'm so sorry for judging you guys earlier.

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:07.609
I mean, people can't always control who or what they're attracted to, and if being together makes you guys happy, that's most important.

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:09.960
Thanks, that's really mature of you.

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:11.980
But I'm not with him.

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:13.440
Oh, my bad.

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:14.700
Yeah, he's just a friend.

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:17.460
Yep.

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:20.520
Oh my God, he thought we were dating. Isn't that hilarious?

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:22.600
So hilarious.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
[Laughter] I mean you're like my best guy friend.

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:27.000
I know, right?

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:50.059
Can we talk about the real issue here? The entire country thinks I'm a national threat.

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:58.220
We're the most non-violent people in the world. We gave you Gandhi. And I'm a mobile app entrepreneur. I drive a Ferrari.

00:05:58.889 --> 00:06:00.889
Where are my girls at?

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:05.090
Oh hey, what's going on?

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:11.959
Hey, you know what they say. Once you go brown, you've made a sound decision, 'cuz we're educated, I come from a good family and

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:13.970
I will love you forever.

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:16.940
What's up, everyone?

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:20.200
Hope you guys liked that short. We had a lot of fun making it.

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:21.780
Yellow Fever 2

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:22.360
Yep.

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:26.100
It's been 10 years since the original. I cannot believe it's been that long.

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:31.580
You know, we, we, we knew that the ten year anniversary was coming up of this really, really important short in Wong Fu's history,

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:36.560
and we just wanted to make something to commemorate that. And, and that's why we just want to revisit

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:37.700
It's not a true sequel.

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:41.929
I know it's called Yellow Fever 2, it's not a real sequel, but we just wanted to come back to it.

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:47.419
It's more of a reboot update video that talks about a lot of new perspectives that weren't touched upon in the original, right?

00:06:47.419 --> 00:06:52.728
That's true. We didn't address a lot of angles and perspectives in the original. So, glad you liked it.

00:06:52.729 --> 00:06:58.219
Hope you liked it, and be sure to watch the bloopers. And also, watch the original, too, if you guys are curious where the inspiration

00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:01.039
came from back when we made this in college.

00:07:01.039 --> 00:07:06.169
We were, we were in college back then, when we first made it. And yeah, subscribe for more videos.

00:07:06.169 --> 00:07:09.349
We got a lot in store coming, and we'll see you guys next time. Bye.
