00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.880
Hello everyone! Virtual Youtuber Kizuna Ai here!

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:03.980
For today...

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:06.340
I want to play a gesture quiz with all of you!

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:07.160
But...

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:08.100
But...!

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:10.880
But doing just a normal Gesture Quiz...

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:12.540
It wouldn't be my style..

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.080
and it wouldn't be very interesting, would it?

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:14.660
So...

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:15.760
this episode we're going to...

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.260
Try doing difficult topics in gestures..

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.280
that you'll probably never guess!

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:23.740
Everyone please guess what the prompts are!

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.660
Well, even if I say they're difficult...

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.280
If it's you guys, you're smart enough to get them, right?

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:29.680
With that, let's get started!

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:31.560
Jaka, jaka, jaka, jan!

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:32.280
Ah, ha, hah..

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:32.780
*inhales*

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:33.740
I see...

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:35.440
Oh yeah, that's right..

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:35.940
This..

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.640
I say it's difficult, but...

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.340
If you guys synchronize on the same wavelength as me...

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.120
You should definitely be able to guess them, right?

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.000
So... let's start the Gesture quiz!

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.780
*Ding*
(Flashing on screen: Gestures in progress)

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:46.220
This is difficult on my side too

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.860
Maybe sort of like this?

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:50.700
And something like this..

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:51.900
Ah, I shouldn't talk..

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:52.760
Hmm..

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.360
Ah, I have a better idea..

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:00.500
*Flap, flap*

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:02.280
Fweu!

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:04.120
Fweu!

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:07.020
*flapping sounds*

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:08.000
Ooh..

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.660
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh..

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:12.700
And also, then...

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:15.360
Then..

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.100
*Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding*

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:21.940
Were you able to guess?

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.080
So then, Thinking time: Start~

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:31.620
Ges, ges, ges.... ges-ges-ges....
(Flashing on screen: Thinking Time)

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.500
And the answer is....

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:34.320
Ja, jan!

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.680
Bird cartilage!
(AKA 'tori no nankotsu', it's usually eaten in yakitori)

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.440
Can you really gesture something like that?

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.020
Good! So onto the next guess!

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.220
Next is..

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.580
Jaka, jaka, jaka, jan!

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:43.080
Hmm..?

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:46.420
Great...

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:47.500
Aa-ah! *stammers*

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:48.640
Shh..

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:49.200
I see..

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.360
Well, well, well..

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.060
If you synchronize your thoughts with me, you know what follows..

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:53.780
Let's go!

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:56.980
So, Gesture Quiz: Start~

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:57.620
*Ding*

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.000
(Flashing on screen: Gestures in progress)

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:43.640
*Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding*

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.600
So then, Thinking Time: Start~

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.760
♪ Gesture shock ♪

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:58.220
*inhales*

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:59.540
How did the song go after this?

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:00.160
Yes!

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:01.020
It's over!

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.720
Gan, gan, gaan!

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:04.160
So now, I'll announce the answer

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:05.460
The answer isss...

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:06.320
at the Great Wall of China...

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:07.540
Kizuna Ai was filming a video when suddenly...

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.420
the police came and warned her!

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.320
Even though I forgot to mime the Great Wall of China...

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.900
Wellll...

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.960
I'm sure that if you guys synchronized your thoughts with mine, you were able to guess

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:16.700
Yes!

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:17.600
Let's move on!

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.120
The next prompt is...

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.180
Jaka, jaka, jakaa, jan!

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:22.160
Huh..

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:24.700
Right, I see...

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.580
Ah!

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.100
I think this is the easiest out of all of them, right?

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:29.880
Well, all of you who are synchronizing your thoughts with me..

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.320
You managed to guess the first two, right?

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:32.880
Here I go, all of you try to guess!

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.140
In this case, let's start with the Gesture Quiz!

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:35.960
*Ding*

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:26.380
*Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding*

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:28.740
Ok, I did this one pretty well!

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:30.980
Of course you guys got it, didn't you?

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:33.880
So let's start thinking time!

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:35.120

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:37.020

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:45.060

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:46.300
It's not chincronized!

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:47.960
It's we synchro-, we synchronized!

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:49.320
♪ We synchronized~ ♪

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:50.840

Gan, gan, gan!

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
Time's up! Beep beep!

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:56.580
Let's go, the right answer is...

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:00.140
An old man doing an impression of Marilyn Monroe under the Statue of Liberty!

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:02.340
Well, of course you guys all got it, right?

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:06.240
Because in the end you're on my wavelength, right?

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:08.100
So, how was that everyone?

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:10.740
Anyone who didn't guess a single one?

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:11.900
Nobody, right?

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:13.300
If you didn't get a single one...

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:16.660
Try just a little bit harder to get on my wavelength!

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:18.420
So, until next time!

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:20.220
This was Virtual Youtuber Kizuna Ai!

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:21.520
See you again!

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:23.480
There's more at the end!

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:24.540
Translated by Server Loli, Myi and Vortex

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:36.380
Alright! Now I'll do the imitation of the Great Wall of China that I forgot to do!
