- I'm Wes.
- I'm Philip,

00:00:04.804 --> 00:00:06.205
and we're Wong Fu Productions.

00:00:06.238 --> 00:00:07.673
And we directed
"Single by 30."

00:00:07.706 --> 00:00:09.208
I just realized that
we haven't talked

00:00:09.241 --> 00:00:10.443
about Mark and Chloe
at all.

00:00:10.476 --> 00:00:11.244
Hmmm.

00:00:11.277 --> 00:00:12.812
Do you have any friends
like that?

00:00:12.845 --> 00:00:14.047
I don't.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:15.615
But...if you think
about it,

00:00:15.648 --> 00:00:16.682
since we created them,

00:00:16.715 --> 00:00:18.518
they're like our
imaginary friends.

00:00:18.551 --> 00:00:20.186
That's really sad.

00:00:21.587 --> 00:00:23.122
I'm gonna miss this.

00:00:23.155 --> 00:00:25.291
What are you
talking about?

00:00:25.324 --> 00:00:26.225
Lisa texted.

00:00:26.258 --> 00:00:27.260
She said that
she wants us

00:00:27.293 --> 00:00:28.528
to get together
with her and Ryan

00:00:28.561 --> 00:00:29.496
this afternoon.

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:31.397
She's never approved
of any of my boyfriends,

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:34.534
so, sadly, this was
probably goodbye sex for us.

00:00:34.567 --> 00:00:35.835
What?

00:00:35.868 --> 00:00:36.736
Uh...

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:37.670
First of all,

00:00:37.704 --> 00:00:39.472
I don't think you
set the bar up very high

00:00:39.505 --> 00:00:42.175
with the ex-boyfriend
of yours, Edmundo.

00:00:42.208 --> 00:00:44.510
Okay, he didn't technically
steal my furniture.

00:00:44.543 --> 00:00:47.480
He just was borrowing it
in a prolonged way.

00:00:47.513 --> 00:00:49.749
Regardless, I could bring
home the love-child

00:00:49.782 --> 00:00:51.784
of Brad Pitt and
Mother Teresa,

00:00:51.817 --> 00:00:54.220
and Lisa would still find
something wrong with him.

00:00:54.253 --> 00:00:55.421
Wow, Pitt and Teresa.

00:00:55.454 --> 00:00:56.522
I would love to sit down

00:00:56.555 --> 00:00:58.491
and have a cup of coffee
with that kid.

00:00:58.524 --> 00:00:59.859
I am serious!

00:00:59.892 --> 00:01:02.462
Nobody gets past
my sister.

00:01:02.495 --> 00:01:05.331
Oh, well, that sounds
like a challenge.

00:01:05.364 --> 00:01:06.165
Well, it's not.

00:01:06.198 --> 00:01:08.568
Well, it definitely
sounds like one.

00:01:09.401 --> 00:01:10.870
Well, I can--I guess--

00:01:10.903 --> 00:01:13.506
I can see how somebody
could interpret it that way.

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:15.475
Look, you tell Lisa
that I'm ready.

00:01:15.508 --> 00:01:16.409
You tell her I'm
not gonna back down,

00:01:16.443 --> 00:01:17.844
and you tell her that
I've been waiting

00:01:17.877 --> 00:01:20.680
for this moment
my entire life.

00:01:20.713 --> 00:01:21.514
Or I could
just tell her

00:01:21.547 --> 00:01:23.216
that we're on
for this afternoon.

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:23.917
Or you can
just tell her

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:24.884
we're on
for this afternoon.

00:01:24.917 --> 00:01:25.852
That works, too, yeah.

00:01:25.885 --> 00:01:28.154
But seriously,
be forewarned,

00:01:28.187 --> 00:01:29.789
if she doesn't
like you,

00:01:29.822 --> 00:01:31.657
I just, I don't see
how this is gonna work.

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:33.793
Okay, can you just,
like, relax?

00:01:33.826 --> 00:01:34.861
She's gonna like me.

00:01:34.894 --> 00:01:36.162
Have you seen me?

00:01:36.195 --> 00:01:38.564
I am a Mark
amongst men.

00:01:38.597 --> 00:01:39.365
Huh!

00:01:39.398 --> 00:01:41.667
- Wow, that was poetic.
- Mm-mmm.

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:42.902
Remind me to put that
in my Twitter bio.

00:01:42.935 --> 00:01:43.903
- No.
- Yep.
