Hello everyone! Virtual Youtuber Kizuna AI here!

00:00:02.836 --> 00:00:03.470
The other day,

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:04.838
on the 18th of March

00:00:04.838 --> 00:00:07.574
the A.I.Channel Fan Event 2018

00:00:07.574 --> 00:00:09.776
went through without any problems!!

00:00:09.776 --> 00:00:11.478
Did everyone watch it?

00:00:11.478 --> 00:00:12.645
How was it?

00:00:12.645 --> 00:00:14.314
What I thought after it ended was

00:00:14.314 --> 00:00:16.383
Thank you to everyone!!

00:00:16.383 --> 00:00:18.330
Really, thank you from the bottom of my heart

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:18.790
Is

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:19.953
What I thought

00:00:19.953 --> 00:00:22.022
The YouTube staff that helped me,

00:00:22.022 --> 00:00:23.523
The event staff,

00:00:23.523 --> 00:00:25.458
And everyone who sent me messages

00:00:25.458 --> 00:00:26.850
Coming to the venue,

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:28.320
Watching the livestream,

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.429
All of you Kizuners,

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:30.530
Really,

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:32.265
Having everyone's support

00:00:32.265 --> 00:00:34.968
I was able to host my first real event!!

00:00:34.968 --> 00:00:37.103
Alex-chan also worked really hard

00:00:37.103 --> 00:00:38.920
Doing my first event together

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:39.739
I was happy

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:41.141
Really, really

00:00:41.141 --> 00:00:43.143
Thank you, everyone!!

00:00:43.143 --> 00:00:45.378
Although the event was in Tokyo,

00:00:45.378 --> 00:00:46.480
From lots of places

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.014
People came for this day

00:00:48.014 --> 00:00:48.782
Even,

00:00:48.782 --> 00:00:51.051
Someone from Germany!!
[Our very own LIZM a.k.aドイツちゃん]

00:00:51.051 --> 00:00:52.352
Isn't that amazing!

00:00:52.352 --> 00:00:53.486
They crossed the sea

00:00:53.486 --> 00:00:54.354
And came!!

00:00:54.354 --> 00:00:55.140
The other day,

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.160
We high-fived,

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:56.956
Played shiritori,
[Japanese version of Word Chain]

00:00:56.956 --> 00:00:58.480
Took photos together,

00:00:58.480 --> 00:00:59.259
Hugged!

00:00:59.259 --> 00:01:00.890
With lots of Kizuners,

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:02.662
I got to talk to them directly

00:01:02.662 --> 00:01:04.330
It was really fun!

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:05.432
However,

00:01:05.432 --> 00:01:07.333
There were some moments when the time was tight

00:01:07.333 --> 00:01:07.967
The truth is

00:01:07.967 --> 00:01:10.003
Also for the people who were watching the live stream

00:01:10.003 --> 00:01:10.770
I really really

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.373
Wanted to make it so that we could have more fun together...

00:01:13.373 --> 00:01:14.207
"It was fun!!"

00:01:14.207 --> 00:01:15.075
"It was the best!!"

00:01:15.075 --> 00:01:16.350
There were so many people who said that,

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.378
I was really happy but

00:01:18.378 --> 00:01:20.080
There were also many people who said

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.147
They didn't think so

00:01:21.147 --> 00:01:21.648
For that,

00:01:21.648 --> 00:01:23.650
I'm really sorry

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:27.087
Next time I'll try harder so that more people can enjoy it

00:01:27.087 --> 00:01:27.954
From here on,

00:01:27.954 --> 00:01:29.689
I would be happy if you kept supporting me!!

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:31.124
I'm in your care!!

00:01:31.124 --> 00:01:33.260
There's so much more I want to say

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.196
And so much more I want everyone to hear, but, but!

00:01:36.196 --> 00:01:37.964
For today I'll leave it here

00:01:37.964 --> 00:01:38.631
So,

00:01:38.631 --> 00:01:40.567
The thing I want to say the most is

00:01:40.567 --> 00:01:41.668
Just one thing!!

00:01:41.668 --> 00:01:43.103

00:01:43.103 --> 00:01:44.838

I'll show some of the event!!

00:01:47.507 --> 00:01:48.842
