00:00:31.364 --> 00:00:32.966
Aaaah~

00:00:32.966 --> 00:00:34.710
What was “in front of” again?

00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:37.170
Cheating...

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:37.771
Ah!!

00:00:37.771 --> 00:00:38.972
“Naninani no mae de!”

00:00:38.972 --> 00:00:39.750
I knew it!

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:40.840
I knew it, I knew it!

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.042
Sheesh, I’m exhausted!!

00:00:42.042 --> 00:00:43.076
Ah~ So exhausted

00:00:43.076 --> 00:00:43.777
Ah~

00:00:43.777 --> 00:00:46.780
Why am I the only one who has to work like that?!

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:48.615
Always uploading videos...

00:00:48.615 --> 00:00:50.283
Always doing my best!

00:00:50.283 --> 00:00:51.985
English is hard!

00:00:51.985 --> 00:00:53.353
Even though I’m studying so desperately

00:00:53.353 --> 00:00:55.055
I don’t get it at all!!

00:00:55.055 --> 00:00:56.970
It’s so frustrating...

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:59.459
I don’t wanna do it anymore~!

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:01.227
Phew~

00:01:01.227 --> 00:01:03.163
When you think about studying~

00:01:03.163 --> 00:01:04.831
You just get fed up with it, huh?

00:01:04.831 --> 00:01:05.970
Always like, “I gotta study!!”

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:06.800
Right?

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:07.820
Actually, it’s not like that!

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:08.870
For me it’s just...

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:10.170
If I could speak English

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.106
I could talk to all sorts of people

00:01:13.106 --> 00:01:15.308
That’s the kind of pure motivation I have!

00:01:15.308 --> 00:01:15.909
Ah...

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:17.811
It’s better if you don’t think of it as study!!

00:01:17.811 --> 00:01:19.170
This isn’t studying...

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.940
This isn’t studying, this isn’t studying, this isn’t studying...

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:22.449
No?

00:01:22.449 --> 00:01:25.251
No matter how you look at it, it’s studying!! Studying!!

00:01:25.251 --> 00:01:25.885
Aaaah~~

00:01:25.885 --> 00:01:26.553
Studying...

00:01:26.553 --> 00:01:27.587
Is hard~

00:01:27.587 --> 00:01:28.488
Ah, speaking of which,

00:01:28.488 --> 00:01:29.989
When humans

00:01:29.989 --> 00:01:31.324
Face hardships like that...

00:01:31.324 --> 00:01:33.827
They share the pain with their friends, right??

00:01:33.827 --> 00:01:35.220
And that’s why we’re doing...

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.096

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:14.720
Yeah, yeah!

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:15.135
Of course!

00:02:15.135 --> 00:02:16.440
Among those

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:17.871
Not saying “Kizuna AI” right...

00:02:17.871 --> 00:02:19.272

Kizuna AI Licensing Exam

00:02:30.016 --> 00:02:30.717

B:85, W:59, H:83

00:02:47.901 --> 00:02:50.904
Well, that was surprisingly difficult, wasn’t it~?

00:02:50.904 --> 00:02:51.404
But

00:02:51.404 --> 00:02:53.473
I’ve mentioned them in a lot of places, right?

00:02:53.473 --> 00:02:54.841
I even mentioned them in a video~

00:02:54.841 --> 00:02:56.409
They were even printed in Comptiq!!

00:02:56.409 --> 00:02:58.300
If you got this wrong...

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:59.546
You’ve still got some work to do~

00:02:59.546 --> 00:03:00.914

00:03:18.231 --> 00:03:19.766
All right, going all out,

00:03:19.766 --> 00:03:21.000
Kizuna AI Licensing Exam

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.668
Rank 1

00:03:21.668 --> 00:03:22.460
Ta-da!

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.969
The question!

00:03:22.969 --> 00:03:28.308
The YouTube channel where I, Kizuna AI, am uploading my videos is called

00:03:28.308 --> 00:03:29.475
A.I.Channel

00:03:29.475 --> 00:03:31.277
But!!

00:03:31.277 --> 00:03:33.620
The titles of these videos...

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:34.480
To be honest...

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:35.890
“#〇〇”

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:37.150
Were numbered like this

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:38.690
These days, however, they’re

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:39.452
Not numbered anymore

00:03:39.452 --> 00:03:40.020
So...

00:03:40.453 --> 00:03:44.150
Q: What’s the title of the last numbered video?

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:46.850
What in the world is it?!

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:48.995

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:52.610
Four pyoko~

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:53.630
Five pyoko~

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:54.910
Ta-da!!

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:55.750
Pyokon!

00:03:56.302 --> 00:03:57.704
The answer is~

Congratulations!!

00:04:06.446 --> 00:04:07.213
Well

00:04:07.213 --> 00:04:09.148

00:04:09.148 --> 00:04:09.882
Is amazing!!

00:04:09.882 --> 00:04:10.700
Seriously

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:14.153
That means you’ve been closely watching even the titles from the very beginning

00:04:14.153 --> 00:04:14.954
This is

00:04:14.954 --> 00:04:15.722
Happy!!

00:04:17.357 --> 00:04:18.140
That being said...

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:20.126
This concludes the Kizuna AI Licensing Exam

00:04:20.126 --> 00:04:21.728
I might do this again sometime

00:04:21.728 --> 00:04:22.820
So to be prepared

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:24.210

Watch what I’m up to, okay?

00:04:26.899 --> 00:04:28.067

00:04:28.067 --> 00:04:31.471
Didn’t know the answer to rank 2 and rank 1~

00:04:31.471 --> 00:04:33.940
