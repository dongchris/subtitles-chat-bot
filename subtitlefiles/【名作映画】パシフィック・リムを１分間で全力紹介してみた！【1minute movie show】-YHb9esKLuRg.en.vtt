00:00:00.085 --> 00:00:02.485
Hello everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai here!

00:00:02.485 --> 00:00:03.200
Today,

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.480
I, Kizuna AI, will be compressing a movie masterpiece

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:07.660
Compressing!

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:10.860
A popular segment where I showcase a movie to everyone in under a minute!

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.320
The movie that I will be showcasing this time is...

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:18.020
"Pacific Rim"!

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:19.680
A Hollywood movie where robots and monsters fight,

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.120
Recently, a sequel was released, garnering attention among the masses.

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:26.000
Due to the inclusion of popular actresses like Rinko Kikuchi and Mana Ashida,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.100
the movie has been in the spotlight in Japan as well!

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:28.920
Without further ado!

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.500
Kizuna AI's one minute movie!

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:32.360
Action!

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:33.400
3...

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:34.620
2...

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:35.680
1!

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.420
Pacific Rim is a story about the war between humankind and monsters

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:39.800
On one fateful day,

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.180
The Earth and the world of monsters had connected with eachother!

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:43.840
Monsters came to the world of humans

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:44.340
They end up rampaging!

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:45.160
Rawrrr!! 🦖

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:46.040
Rawrrr!! 🦖

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:47.340
Humankind was in peril

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.340
"Only if there was a Super AI like entity,

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:51.920
an extremely beautiful one at that,

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.780
the world would be saved!"

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:54.440
But,

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.460
An entity akin to someone like me, Kizuna AI,

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:57.120
does not exist in the movie!

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:57.720
Due to that,

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.560
They had decided to build robots to fight against the monsters!

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.140
JAEGARRRRRRRRR!!

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:02.600
The robots, the Jaegar,

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.900
has a function where it needs to be piloted by two people simultaneously.

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.520
Also!

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.540
The bond between the two pilots contribute to the strength of the Jaegar.

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:08.040
And,

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:09.720
This is where she appears,

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:10.740
Mana Ashida!

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:12.400
It's Mana Ashida~ ⭐

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.100
Mana will do my best,

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:15.840
Mana-chan!

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.940
So cute!

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:17.500
Mana-chan's role is

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.040
the younger version of Rinko Kikuchi's role, Mako!

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.320
This and that happens, and humankind and monsterkind end up fighting each other!

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.100
Rocket Puuuuuuuuunch!!

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.760
But!

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.740
The number of monsters is infinite

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.060
Utterly impossible!

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.660
The humans lose!

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:29.660
Then,

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:30.700
A mister has a revelation.

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:31.320
"Oh!"

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.200
"Let's blow everything up!"

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:32.960
"There!"

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.540
The mister saves the Earth!

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:35.920
Misterrrrrrrr!!

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.200
*Finish!!*

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:38.560
Whew!

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.560
Knowing me, I knew I would be able to describe the movie in a very understandable manner.

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.680
Now you want to watch the movie right?

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:45.620
Right?

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:48.360
If you thought the movie was interesting after you listened to me,

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:49.040
Please!

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:50.880
Please go to a movie theater and watch it!

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.380
The movie, "Pacific Rim: Uprising" is currently screening!

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.940
Of course,

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.580
I am,

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:56.080
 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:57.440
not in it!

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.940
That being said,

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:00.140
This was Virtual YouTuber Kizuna AI!

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:01.600
See you later!

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:12.720
