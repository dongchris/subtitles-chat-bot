00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:09.300
This fall on the Bachelorette,
a season unlike any other.

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:13.260
Yeah, it's always been a dream of mine
to be on the Bachelorette.

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:15.900
I just-- I know I'm gonna find
my true love here.

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.700
Yeah, I can not wait to meet all the guys.

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.000
Hi, I'm Matthew.
[Brittany] Hi.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:29.100
I'm Brittany.

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.720
You look stunning.

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.240
[Brittany] Thank you.

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.600
I was surprised.. But hey, it's great!
[chuckles]

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.400
I'm here to meet all types of guys.

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.700
You look beautiful.

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:47.420
[Brittany] Nice to meet you.

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:48.140
The pleasure is mine.

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:51.620
Okay, so I'm... seeing a pattern here.

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.300
Alright, what's going on?

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:04.000
13 seasons, 325 men,
but only three Asians. Ever.

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:05.300
That's...

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.940
.9% of the show!

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.800
This season,
we're making up for lost time.

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.920
Okay guys, you ready?
It's time to head on into the house.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.300
[Matthew] I'm gonna use your shoulders.
[Phil] Yeah yeah, sure sure sure.

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.700
[Phil] Oh my god, those are really nice!

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.500
[Phil] Hey, where's the brown shoes?
Where's the brown--

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:25.800
Uh hi, I'm Jarrod,

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:30.800
and I've got my Master's degree,
my PhD degree, but what I don't have,

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.000
is my Bachelorette degree. [chuckles]

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.300
[in Mandarin] Hi, I'm Ming.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.700
[in English with Chinese accent]
I'm here to bring ratings from China.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.900
Hey guys, I'm Nick. I'm a dentist,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.560
and I'm from Edison, New Jersey
and I'm here to represent Browntown.

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:44.400
Hi, I'm Tom. [scoffs]

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.960
I'm not here to make friends.
I'm here to drink.

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.200
[stammers] Um, am I on the right show?

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.140
Alright, boys. Cheers!

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:52.960
[all] Cheers!

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:53.480
Wait, wait, wait!

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.880
Does anybody need a Pepcid?

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.080
[exclaiming] Oh my gosh, yeah! We almost forgot.

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.100
I guess a lot of the guys
have really bad acid reflux?

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.400
[all] Cheers! Woo!

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:10.720
[inaudible noises]

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.700
Yeah, I didn't know Asians drink so much.

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:20.100
Glenn, Johnny, Dom. First name basis.
You know we want to get that expensive s**t.

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.500
It's gonna be a party!

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.600
Giving these guys the exposure
we've all been missing.

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:33.180
[music]

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.900
Okay yes, I'll admit,
you know, before the show,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.600
I had never dated an Asian guy before.

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:44.600
But now, I've learned to look past
all the superficial stuff,

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:45.920
and, you know, just...

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.300
just focus on what's inside.

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.000
[Bart] This is a mandarin... like me.
[laughs]

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.500
I think we got a pretty good chance 
making it to the end.

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.900
I mean, we're a brother duo with abs.

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.560
How can you top that?
[both laugh]

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.300
[Jason] Hi, I'm Jason.
[Justin] I'm Justin.

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.300
[both] And we're twins.

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:08.760
F**k!

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.600
And they have abs too...

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:13.600
I quit, I'm-- I'm out.

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.680
The most talented cast we've ever seen.

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.600
Being the first Filipino contestant
on the Bachelorette

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.700
I'm hoping to stand out with my singing.

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:26.800
I didn't think we were gonna go there,
but if we're resorting to cheap tricks,

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:29.000
[cracks neck] it's about to go down.

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:36.500
[bleep]

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:38.820
Want to see real talent?

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:45.000
So I've already prepared
all your taxes for the year.

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:46.100
Oh, wow.

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:51.520
Looks like you have a very tiny cavity
on your premolar but don't worry,

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.580
I can take care of that under the table.
[Brittany] Alright!

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:56.100
How about this table?

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:01.760
I sold an app in China
for 450 million dollars.

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:07.480
[yelling] Ah! What's up bitches!? Woo!

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:09.420
That's talent, baby!

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:12.240
[yelling] I'M DRUNK!

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:17.400
Asian guys are, like, so multi-talented,
and I am becoming so cultured.

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.700
So, this is dim sum,
[Brittany] Uh huh.

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:23.600
which is what we will be doing
to the lights later... if you want to.

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:26.600
Did you know there's
over 720 dialects of Hindi?

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:28.200
Some would say...

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.100
I'm an expert in tongues.

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:32.420
I like making personalized gifts,
[Brittany] Mm-hmm.

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.100
So I put your face on a pillow

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:38.460
What? They're very popular in Japan.

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.700
Could love be in the air?

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:46.000
Tax return and--
[Mike] Hey, uh... can I steal you for a second?

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:49.860
I think one of these men
is really starting to stand out.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.400
And I know I know I know,
I said I'd never date an actor,

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:56.220
but he's really handsome and charming.

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:59.580
And he's been in some big, like,
Korean dramas. That's pretty cool.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.320
Say it again.

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:04.100
[in Korean] Soondubu

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:06.900
Secrets come out.

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:08.100
Brittany, wait!

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:10.300
Have you seen this?

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:11.460
What is that?

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:13.180
That is a photo of Mike.

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:16.200
But you wouldn't recognize him
because he's had plastic surgery

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:17.900
Is this-- Is this true?

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:20.200
It-- Look, it was just the eyelids.
J-- Just the eyelids!

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.220
It's very cheap in Korea.
If you ever want to--

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:23.500
What?!

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.400
[crying] I'm sorry. I--

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:27.800
I can't do this right now. No.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.500
-Stop lying to her!
-Guys, please!

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:31.900
-Please stop!
-You shut the f**k up.
I told you that in confidence.

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:34.200
Do you know how old this guy is? He's 53!

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:35.500
What?

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:38.000
Look, it's not my fault
Asians don't raisin.

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:40.280
-I'm sorry.
-We're finished! Okay?

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:41.800
[background] That is no way to start a relationship.

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:43.120
[crying]

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:45.500
Oh my God! I mean--

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:50.160
The feelings are just, like,
eating me away!

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:53.700
A season, unlike anything,
you've ever seen.

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:57.380
Literally. We've never even seen, like,
two Asians at a time.

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:01.000
And here is my roll.
[Brittany] That looks so good.

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:03.180
Here's my roll.

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:05.660
Wow! That is one big roll [chuckle]

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:07.320
It's not even practical

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.100
[Brittany] FASTER! 
[Phil] YEAH
[Brittany] UGHH THAT IS SO GOOD!

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:15.820
Brittany, I thought you said I was your best DotA partner.

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:19.100
Jajangmyeon is a Chinese dish.
You told her it was from Korea.

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:21.020
She don't know the difference!

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:22.200
Get outta here!

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:25.000
I never thought this decision
would be so difficult.

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:26.680
I didn't sign up for this.

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:28.300
I would've just got an arranged marriage.

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:30.860
I'll even cut off my man bun
for you, girl!

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.200
I don't even think people know I'm here.

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:34.900
I mean, have I gotten any screen ti--

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:37.700
-No, Justin. Please! No, Justin!
-I can't believe you do that to me.

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:40.600
I thought Thai food was from Taiwan. I--

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:46.160
That's how you do it. Some people are here for the wrong reasons.

00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:48.600
It's ruining the sanctity
of this whole thing.

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:49.800
He's got to go.

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:52.100
I think my journey here is almost done.

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:54.500
When I think of you, I think...

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:56.320
The One.

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:01.980
It's my favorite movie. I love that guy

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:04.900
I think I made the right choice.

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:06.100
Gentlemen.

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:09.200
Now it is the end of the show,

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:11.960
and Brittany has thought
very hard about her decision.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.620
And the final, Red Envelope goes to...

00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:30.600
[yelling] IM DRUNK!

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:32.480
[laughter]

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:34.320
It's very cheap in Korea.

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:35.560
You know, if you ever want to get anything...

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:36.060
[Brittany] What!

00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:39.020
Wow bro.

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:42.400
[Indistinct Imitation]

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:44.680
[laughter]

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:48.180
I'm crying right now, but I just can't because of the surgery.

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:50.180
[inaudible]

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:52.880
This is a mandarin,

00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:54.120
like me.

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:54.700
[giggle]

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:57.100
Let's make mandarin juice.

00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:57.620
[giggle]

00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:00.420
[laughter]

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:03.140
[Phil] Did you say mandarin juice?

00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:03.640
[Bart] Yeah.

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:04.680
[laughter]

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:07.340
All right. Hey, everyone. Hope you guys liked that video

00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:11.070
We noticed with this past season of the Bachelorette that there actually were a couple of Asian guys

00:08:11.070 --> 00:08:16.589
And it made us think why haven't there been more asian people like on the show over the course of all the seasons

00:08:16.589 --> 00:08:20.480
I mean, I think we make pretty good contestants wouldn't you guys agree?

00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:24.320
Hopefully we can get to a point someday where it's not weird to see Asians in this way

00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:28.169
And maybe we'll even have an Asian Bachelor or an Asian Bachelorette. In the meantime

00:08:28.170 --> 00:08:32.309
it was a lot of fun working with our friends on this video be sure to check out their links below
