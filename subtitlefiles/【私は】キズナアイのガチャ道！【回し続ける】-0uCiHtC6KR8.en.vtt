00:00:01.901 --> 00:00:04.470
When we are born

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.007
we are each given our own stone

00:00:07.574 --> 00:00:09.800
Our expectations,

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:11.350
reason for living,

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:13.060
and luck.

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:15.448
All those encompass this game...

00:00:15.448 --> 00:00:18.018
of Gacha.

00:00:18.084 --> 00:00:21.488
We must follow the rules of RNG in this game of Gacha.

00:00:21.488 --> 00:00:26.450
Thus with joy, sadness, and anger,

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:27.660
we people are dyed.

00:00:28.361 --> 00:00:31.600
No matter if you be a great CPO,

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.466
no matter if you be a revered idol,

00:00:33.466 --> 00:00:36.490
there is simply no running from

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:37.971
this eternal RNG.

00:00:37.971 --> 00:00:42.120
The only people who can stop this phenomenon

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.777
are the rumored RNG Warriors...

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:47.900
I, Kizuna Ai.

00:00:54.187 --> 00:00:55.120
Thus,

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.232
I have decided to fight.

00:00:57.232 --> 00:01:00.000
With my limitless power,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.531
I will oppose this world.

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.890
These warriors who must pull their best girl,

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.700
the RNG Warriors, burdened by fate itself.

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.220
That is to say,

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.400
they must try again and again until she appears.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.080
That is what I believed.

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:22.520
Even if...

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.350
that was my own fate too.

00:01:27.821 --> 00:01:30.530
In order to repage

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.425
this never-ending fate of despair...

00:01:33.093 --> 00:01:35.410
I

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:38.565
will continue this struggle.

00:01:38.832 --> 00:01:43.010
We will overcome this despair no matter how long it takes

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:46.673
and strive for a future with our best girls...

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.090
This is my new Gacha,

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.630
breaking this chain

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:51.700
of repetition...

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:54.870
Kizuna AI: Recharge

00:01:56.916 --> 00:01:59.960
When I was born

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.556
I was given a space of pure white.

00:02:03.556 --> 00:02:04.991
So, how was that?

00:02:04.991 --> 00:02:07.820
When you don’t pull any of your top five girls

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:09.762
and can’t find the will to continue...

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:11.097
That's something I, Supervisor Kizuna AI,

00:02:11.097 --> 00:02:13.229
often say, isn’t it?

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:15.135
When you had been so sure that you’d get there

00:02:15.135 --> 00:02:15.668
with resolution,

00:02:15.668 --> 00:02:16.336
a sense of despair,

00:02:16.336 --> 00:02:16.940
but determination

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.172
simply oozing from your spirit...

00:02:19.172 --> 00:02:20.940
If you don’t take a pull, you won’t get your best girl

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.142
That’s the way it is!

00:02:22.142 --> 00:02:24.811
If you don’t try, you’ll never get her

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:28.820
The truth is as painful as being stabbed in the heart!

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:29.600
Saying that!

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.518
Money is very important

00:02:31.518 --> 00:02:33.600
People often say that you should

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.021
spend it wisely when planning gacha, yes?

00:02:35.021 --> 00:02:36.322
Supervisor, Kizuna AI, believes

00:02:36.322 --> 00:02:39.959
you should work out your own position and experience

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:41.194
and find that, in reality,

00:02:41.194 --> 00:02:42.729
a deafening alarm

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:44.998
is ringing out! Isn’t that right?

00:02:44.998 --> 00:02:45.398
So,

00:02:45.398 --> 00:02:48.234
how did you all feel about this today?

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.900
I wonder if anyone managed to notice!

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:51.970
Actually,

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.460
this video was inspired by

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:55.542
a game called

00:02:55.542 --> 00:02:58.620
Grimms Notes!

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.079
You can see images on their website
[http://www.grimmsnotes.jp]

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:03.900
So you may find it interesting to compare the two!

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.630
Of course, don’t forget about the game itself too!

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:09.430
You can play it anytime, anywhere, for free!

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:10.370
Ahh

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:12.370
Aren’t you hyped?

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:13.960
Check it out and enjoy!

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:14.894
Ahh!

00:03:14.894 --> 00:03:16.080
YouTube

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.431
is really fun, right?

00:03:18.431 --> 00:03:21.640
With that, look forward to more from A.I.Channel!

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:25.140
