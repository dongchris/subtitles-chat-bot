00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:02.650
Hello everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna AI here!

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:04.340
How is everyone getting along?

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:07.407
Has everyone just about gotten used to their new life~?

00:00:07.407 --> 00:00:08.808
Speaking of new life

00:00:08.808 --> 00:00:10.276
So that I too can change my mood

00:00:10.276 --> 00:00:11.244
I want to redecorate

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:13.290
What should I change? What should I change?

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:14.481
What should I change--?

00:00:14.481 --> 00:00:15.815
Hmmm…

00:00:15.815 --> 00:00:16.316
Oh, I know!

00:00:16.316 --> 00:00:18.885
I should change the illustration on my easel!

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:20.353
Ah! Yeah! Oh, yeah!

00:00:20.353 --> 00:00:21.955
Why didn't I notice before?

00:00:21.955 --> 00:00:24.157
With some kind of cute illustration as decoration

00:00:24.157 --> 00:00:25.825
The atmosphere will totally change~!

00:00:25.825 --> 00:00:26.760
Oh, but, yeah…

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.561
Even if I decorate with a picture I drew

00:00:28.561 --> 00:00:31.197
It might not really be interesting~

00:00:31.197 --> 00:00:32.599
Hmmm…

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:35.735
What should I do~?

00:00:35.735 --> 00:00:37.537
Ah! That's it!

00:00:37.537 --> 00:00:40.306
I should borrow everyone's power~

00:00:40.306 --> 00:00:42.275
If everyone draws a picture for me

00:00:42.275 --> 00:00:44.544
I should decorate with that~!

00:00:44.544 --> 00:00:45.712
Genius!

00:00:45.712 --> 00:00:46.980
After all, I am…

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.815
A genius~!

00:00:48.815 --> 00:00:50.150
Ohhh, but

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:52.152
Since I'm virtual, yeah…

00:00:52.152 --> 00:00:53.453
Even if you draw it for me

00:00:53.453 --> 00:00:55.555
How can I get it from you?

00:00:55.555 --> 00:00:56.189
Moreover

00:00:56.189 --> 00:00:58.425
I want the pictures to pile up, yeah~

00:00:58.425 --> 00:00:59.793
Ah! Of course!

00:00:59.793 --> 00:01:00.990
If you go on Twitter

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:02.762
And post the picture you made

00:01:02.762 --> 00:01:05.131
With hashtag #イーゼルイラコン ["Easel Illustration Contest"]

00:01:05.131 --> 00:01:07.767
You can submit it that way~!

00:01:07.767 --> 00:01:08.601
Ahhh~!

00:01:08.601 --> 00:01:09.269
If you do that

00:01:09.269 --> 00:01:10.437
However much you send

00:01:10.437 --> 00:01:11.404
However much it piles up

00:01:11.404 --> 00:01:13.039
It will be perfect~!!

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:14.240
I am such the

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.676
Intelligent being, yeah!

00:01:16.676 --> 00:01:19.045
I'm so smart it's frightening!

00:01:19.045 --> 00:01:20.580
