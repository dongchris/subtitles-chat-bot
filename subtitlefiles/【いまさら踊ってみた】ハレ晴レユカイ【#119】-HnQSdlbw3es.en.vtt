00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.680
Hello, everyone! Virtual Youtuber Kizuna Ai here!

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:03.800
For today...

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:05.000
All of a sudden..

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:06.520
I wanted to dance...

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:08.240
So I'll dance!

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:10.440
Why do I suddenly feel like dancing?

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.280
Well, there's no reason in particular!

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:14.520
I just simply felt like it, just a feeling!~

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:15.460
Good, in this case

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:17.120
The song that I will dance today...

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.600
I'll let the Random Word Generator decide!

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:21.240
Well, let's start right away!

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:23.380
*Jaka, jaka, jaka-aa, JAN!*

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.840
Hare Hare Yukai..?
(Sunny, Sunny Happiness)

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:27.720
Ehh?

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:29.200
It's too late...

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:30.400
So then..

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:31.780
In this occasion..

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:33.160
It has been decided...

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:34.460
That I'll dance..

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.600
The nostalgic song of Hare Hare Yukai!

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:38.160

Since I was not able to dance..

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.040
