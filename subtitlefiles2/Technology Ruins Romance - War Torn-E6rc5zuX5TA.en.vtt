00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:34.760
...Oh. Um...

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:37.220
Is Susie Beth here?

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:39.620
Oh no. She moved away months ago.

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:41.960
She said her husband was missing in the war.

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.140
Broken-hearted, she moved far away to run from the pain.

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.580
I don't understand...

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:51.360
...I'm her husband!

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.580
Charlie Company. Insurgents, they took a hold of us...

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.000
...I barely escaped alive.

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:00.540
How will I ever find her?

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:08.020
I suppose now, I should embark on a long, difficult journey to find the love of my life.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.160
It may take months.

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.000
It may take years.

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.740
I may have to travel to Area 68 -the Danger Zone.

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:20.880
But I will find her.

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.820
Umm...couldn't you just give her a call?

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:26.020
I mean, you are her husband, right?

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:27.800
You must have her cell phone number.

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.120
She probably didn't change it.

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.000
Yeah, I guess I could do that.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.120
Or, uh... contact a family member? Email?

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:40.960
Well, you... you got a point.

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.560
Actually, I think I have her phone number...

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:46.660
..Yep!

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:48.760
It's ringing, here you go.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:50.540
Oh, okay, okay, uh...

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:52.380
Hello?

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:54.180
Susie Beth?

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.300
Yeah...I was captured by insurgents!

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:00.400
Don't you watch the news?

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:01.820
They did a whole story about it!

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:03.660
You're at the Taco Hut?

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.860
Do they still have the two for 99 cents special?

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:08.960
No, I want the steak!

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:09.960
You know I don't like chicken!

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:11.420
Ho- Okay, I'll be right there, hold on.

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:12.960
I-I'm on my way right now! Okay, ho-

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.960
I don't know how this guy has your phone number!

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.000
Hold on, let me get back to you.

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:18.020
Thanks.

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:19.540
You're welcome.
