00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.040

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.600

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.080
(your call has been forwarded to an automatic voice message system.)

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:22.500
alright, i'm finally done here.

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.780

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.140
and, i had to use my phone's camera but... photos look good.

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:30.300
(why didn't you use your work camera?)

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.080
because my work camera's in the bag!

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.980
(which bag, the one you can't find?)

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.880

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:39.160
oh oh she's calling me back!

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.600

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:41.860

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.720

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:46.260
hello?

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:47.920
[hi, you have my bag?]

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:49.500

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.680
[uh, yeah, i got your text. sorry, i was on the plane]

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.200

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.080
[...LA, where are you?]

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:58.620
new york.

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.460
um, i'm Daniel, i have your bag. do you have mine?

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:08.880
[hi Daniel, yea, i think so. why don't you have a name tag? that's really unsafe]

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:12.260
just tell me, does it have five stars on the back in the shape of gemini?

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.080
[i'm a tourist, so...]

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.040
five dots like upside-down U

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:17.960
[well, if you mean like this then yes]

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.720
that's, that's it, that's, that's my bag

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.760
[so, what do we do now?]

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.800
let's exchange addresses. we'll just have to mail them back uh, tomorrow, if you don't mind

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:33.760
[uh, yea sure, i'll text it to you]

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:34.700
thanks, uh, me too.

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.740
jeez, i really don't know how this happened...i know i had my bag getting off the plane...

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.140
[and i know i left my apartment with mine...]

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:45.260
then i just went to the bathroom 'cause i was holding it for five hours-

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:51.360
[TMI, and that's /not/ healthy...i needed to wake up so i went to-]

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:52.200
then i just stopped at

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:53.120
(together) the coffee shop!

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:55.420
you're the girl who held up the line!

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:57.120
blah blah blah blah blah!! blah blah bl-

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.240
[you're the pushy guy behind me!]

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:00.940
UGHHHH I NEED COFFEE!!

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.520
i /knew/ i didn't lose my bag...you /stole/ it!

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.340
[i obviously didn't steal it if i'm /calling/ you right now]

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:07.180
right.

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:10.700
[look, i have Edgar /and/ a name tag attached to mine]

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:11.900
wh- wait, who's Edgar?

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:16.340
[the panda on the zipper, that's his...name. how could you not see that?]

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:19.340
[all you have are little marks in the shape of some star!]

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:26.520
uh, some star? it's /gemini/, it's a constellation? a /group/ of stars.

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:28.200
[wooow.]

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:30.920
uh,

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:36.820
anyway, uh, i'll mail it off first thing in the morning

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:40.900
[uh, yea, me too, i guess. thanks... ]

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:43.700
wait, wait, Jean, Jean!

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:44.680
[wait wh-wh-what? what's wrong?]

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:53.040
just, just wanted to say....sorry if i came off as pushy, i was...just a little stressed and i'm not usually like that.

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:58.740
[it's...cool...we all have those moments and i was distracted too]

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:03.880
and plus, there was only one cran-apple muffin left and i was really scared you were gonna take it and-

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:09.140
[well, you got your muffin but lost your bag. hope it was worth it]

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:13.900
yea, it was. anyway, i'll talk to you later, thanks

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:14.880
[bye]

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:57.400
[hello?]

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:00.480
uh, hey Jean, it's Daniel again

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:03.840
[yea, i know, i saved your number]

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:05.020
you did?

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:06.960
[danapple]

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:10.200
[rhymes with cranapple?]

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:12.500
n-no i, i got it

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:16.397
um, anyway uh, i know this is gonna sound crazy but...

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:20.300
my boss just emailed me and he's putting me on a job in LA in four days

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:24.140
[riiight....how convenient]

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:26.860
seriously, i'm, i'm not that creepy

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:30.537
anyway um, i figured the mail would probably take longer so...

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:35.520
i could just bring the bag with me and we could exchange them in person? what do you think?
