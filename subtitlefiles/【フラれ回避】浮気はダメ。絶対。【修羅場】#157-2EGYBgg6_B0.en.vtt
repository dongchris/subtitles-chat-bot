Hello everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai here!

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:05.200
Today, I'll be digging out "Furare Kaihi"
(“Break-Up Dodge”)

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:06.540
Continuing where we left off...

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:07.830
So, let's do it!

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.150
Break-Up Dodge, start!

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:12.600
“Third level: Incoming Call”

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.040
Well, I'm used to this game so it'll be a piece of cake

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.260
"Third Stage"

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:21.060
Ooh, we're already flirting! Right?
“BF: Hey, come a little closer~❤”

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.200
"Come closer"? You're close enough already!

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.300
"GF: No way, why would I do that? ❤", I mean, you're close enough!

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.300
"BF: I want to see you a little closer ❤"

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.260
Are you farsighted?!
"GF: What are you saying? You..."

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.260
"What are you saying? You..."

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:33.920
*phone ringing*

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:35.240
Ah

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:36.380
*phone ringing*

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.900
♪ Tun, tun, tun, tun. ♪
*incoming call*

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.160
"GF: That call just now..."

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:42.260
Well...

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:43.600
A guy from work...

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:44.780
"Who was it from?"
"GF: Who was it from?"

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:45.620
AAAHH!

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:46.920
"A stranger"...

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:48.760
Is not the right option...

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.260
"A stranger" is not the right option...

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.260
"Ah, it's the alarm" isn't it, either...

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.720
Won't she notice that's a lie?

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:54.480
"Umm...?"

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.500
“GF: Who called you? Was it one of your friends?"

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:01.620
*1: That's right 2: You could say, yes 3: There's no need to know *

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.120
"That’s right"

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.340
"GF: Hmm, well, call them back then"

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:09.340
"Call the speaking clock"?!

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.240
"Call a male friend"...

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.000
No, it's probably best to be honest...
*Call her*

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.220
*phone ringing*

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.520
Oh, that's what it meant with "her"?
“GF: Hey, what does this mean?”

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.620
"I'd never call anyone but you!"

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.760
Aaaaahhh! Haha...
“GF: Do you think this is a joke? Stop thinking I'm stupid!”

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:25.700
*inhales*

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.620
Iiiiiii'm very sorry!

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:29.860
*Excuse Failed*

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:30.360
*ding*

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.100
Fight!

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.160
"GF: Who was it from?"

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.160
"BF: That's my alarm!"

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.700
"GF: Why did you set your alarm for now?"

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.080
"BF: It's our make-out time alarm ❤ Mrrowl!"

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:45.880
“GF: Kyaaa!”

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.310
Wow, that was eas– huh?

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.280
Did it work?

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:48.900
Eh?
*phone ringing*

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.040
Ah
“GF: I'll get it”

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.580
AAAHHHHH!

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:55.560
*ding, ding, ding, ding, ding*

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:56.640
“I'll get it”

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:58.840
*Excuse Failed*

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.640
You know, I really thought that one would work…

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.920
"A stranger"?

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.400
“GF: Hmm... can I see?”

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.920
“Of course, go right ahead!”

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.700
“GF: Isn't it a contradiction that even though she’s in your contacts, she's a stranger?”

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:13.720
It's true!

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.980
That's right!

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:15.500
*ding, ding, ding*

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.100
Pin pon! Right answer!

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.000
*Excuse Failed*

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.360
Well, here...

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
"It's the alarm!"

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.040
And now...

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.220
"It's 3 o'clock, it’s time for an afternoon snack!"

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.320
“GF: What do you mean by that?”
"What do you mean by that?"

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.420
“I’ll bring out the black tea and afternoon snacks!”

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:40.560
“GF: Why are you running away like that? You chicken”

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:41.340
Hmm...
*ding, ding, ding, ding, ding*

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.320
Girls are so...

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.320
Troublesome!

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.380
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.420
“GF: Who is it?”

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:52.080
"Ummm?"

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.080
“GF: The call, is it from a friend?”

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:54.080
“That's right”

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:55.040
A male friend!

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.000
“GF: Hmm, then call him back”

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.540
Yes

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:57.280
*Call your male friend*

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.480
“BF: Hello? It's me, what do you need me for?”
“...Need you?”

00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:59.300
“GF: Hand it over for a sec”

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:00.120
“GF: Hello? It's his girlfriend”

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.080
“GF: Did you just make the phone call?”

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.380
“Friend: Ah-... I made the call! I made the call!” *A.I noises*

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.520
“GF: Ah, that's how it was, right...!” *A.I noises*

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:05.920
That's a great guy!

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.840
You have some good friends...
“BF: Ah hello, I'm sorry about my girlfriend!”
“Friend: You're buying me lunch tomorrow, ok?”

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.140
*Excuse CLEAR!*

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.380
Eh? That's sneaky...

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:13.800
I see...

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.500
Girls out there, don't get deceived!

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:18.500
Continuing on...

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:20.500
“Anniversary”!

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.320
Anniversaries are pretty important, right?

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:25.960
“BF: No one's looking, feed me ❤, Aaaaaah ❤”

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:29.100
"No one's looking, feed me ❤, Aaaaaah ❤"

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.200
“GF: Oh you~❤ After one year you haven't changed a bit, have you?”

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:34.920
Ah, it's been one year...

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.080
“BF: Hnn?! The fresh pasta you're feeding me is delicious~❤”

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:40.780
♪ The pasta is made delicious because of you ♪

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:42.500
“GF: Yeah, yeah ❤ Of course, BF-kun…”

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:43.380
"Of course..."

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:45.760
“GF: Today’s our anniversary right....? ❤”

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:47.240
Eh? Did you forget? No way...

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.920
*ding*

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.880
*inhales*

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:50.820
You shouldn't forget your one year anniversary!
“GF: What day is today?”

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:52.320
"What day is today?"

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.800
"Man, so much time has passed already?"

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:57.980
“GF: It passed in the blink of an eye, right?”

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:59.060
"It passed in the blink of an eye, right?"

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:00.920
Maybe this one?

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:05.280
"Unlike today, you cooked for me, right?"

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.280
*Secret Unlocked!*

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:12.140
Mmm? A secret!

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:13.600
“Awful Food”

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:14.840
So there are secrets?

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:16.740
I wonder if every stage has one...

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:19.700
"Awful Food" sounds pretty bad, doesn’t it?

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:21.480
“BF: Ah~ I'm feeling hungry ❤”

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:22.960
"Ah~ I'm feeling hungry ❤"

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:24.420
“GF: It's almost done”

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:27.040
“BF: Will you be the desert after dinner? ❤” Die...

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:29.040
“GF: No way~ ❤” Die...

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:30.880
“GF: Thank you for waiting ♪”

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:32.260
“BF: It looks delicious~❤”

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.740
♪ The pasta that you prepared is delicious ♪

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:39.420
"GF: What do you think?"

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:43.100
“Mmm, delicious ❤”

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:45.460
“GF: However, you're shaking a bit…”

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:46.660
Don't shake!

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:49.900
“I'm shaking because it tastes good...!”

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:52.320
“GF: I'm happy, eat it steadily ♪”

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:55.960
“I want to eat slowly to appreciate the taste”

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:58.340
Eh? Was it useless?

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:59.440
*ding, ding, ding, ding, ding*

00:04:59.440 --> 00:04:59.940
He-heh..
*ding, ding, ding, ding, ding*

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:03.960
Has so much time passed that he's now an old man?

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:04.460
*ding*

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:08.060
Here, let's be truthful and say it's bad...

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:10.120
And say that we could give her cooking lessons...

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:13.220
Saying "It's delicious" and "let's eat together"...

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:15.180
She might notice that it wasn't delicious...

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:18.720
And she'll think that even though you didn't like it, you really did your best trying to eat it despite that...

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:20.160
Yes, this one's perfect!

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:22.440
“Yes, because it's delicious”

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:25.520
“Do you want to eat together?”
“GF: I'm on a diet...”

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:26.680
"I'm on a diet"

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:28.500
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?!

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:31.780
Fight!

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:35.180
“...Did you try tasting it?”

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:37.280
"GF: I did?... Is it bad?"

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:41.520
"BF: Yeah, do you want to eat out?"

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:43.700
"GF: Have a nice trip. You don’t have to come back"

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:44.860
WHY?!

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:47.980
ISN'T IT YOUR FAULT FOR PREPARING SOMETHING SO AWFUL?!

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:49.720
No, this is not good, not good...

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:52.660
If it’s not quite to your taste...

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:54.660
Well, you should try your best to eat it...

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:57.560
But if it’s so bad that you can’t even eat it, that’s not good!

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:58.740
It's the girl's fault

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:01.320
"Aah, it tastes amazing"

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:04.020
"GF: Did you say amazing...?"

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:08.160
"It means you're very talented!"

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:10.240
"GF: Great! I'll make it everyday!"

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:11.560
"Great! I'll make it everyday!"

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:12.320
I'm finished!

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:13.640
*ding, ding, ding, ding, ding*

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:14.480
*inhales*

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:15.340
I’m finished...

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:16.320
*inhales*

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:17.900
Please, not everyday!

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:18.400
I'll prepare...

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:18.900
Ah!

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:20.000
Maybe it's better that I prepare it?

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:20.500
*ding*

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:23.160
"GF: How is it?"

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:26.020
“Mmhm, delicious ❤”
And now?

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:27.760
"GF: You're shaking a little bit..."

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:30.160
"I'm starting to feel..."

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:33.340
“GF: You don’t have to go that far! Now I’m the one who’s feeling bad!”

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:37.460
WHY THE HELL? I'M THE ONE WHO'S FEELING SICK RIGHT NOW!

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:40.480
This is kind of like the girl who doesn't speak up and the guy who doesn't notice, right?

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:41.920
This is a girl that doesn't notice, right?

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:44.040
Eh? What should I do?

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:47.780
"Mmm, tastes good"

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:49.340
Can you eat it with me somehow?

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:53.260
"It tastes so great that I'm shaking..."

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:57.340
“GF: I'm happy, eat it steadily ♪”

00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:58.840
"I'm full right now..."

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:02.580
“GF: But didn’t you just say you were hungry?”

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:03.780
“GF: If it’s bad, you should just say so!”

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:07.200
WHEN I TOLD YOU IT WAS AWFUL, YOU GOT ANGRY!

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:08.500
Hey!

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:10.280
*ding, ding, ding, ding, ding*

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:11.740
WHY?!

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:14.400
WOMAN ARE REALLY EGOTISTICAL!

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:16.780
If you're told it tastes horrible...

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:18.100
Don't get so angry!

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:19.920
It's your fault for making horrible food!

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:21.280
Go to a cooking class!

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:23.560
Can I not ask if her mother should have taught her?

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:25.100
“GF: How is it?”

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:26.460
"Wow... that's amazing..."

00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:28.380
"GF: Did you say amazing...?"

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:31.560
"BF: Ah! There's a huge fly over there!”

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:34.040
"Ah! There's a huge fly over there!"

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:35.940
“It’d be a shame if it gets to the food!"

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:38.920
"GF: Wait, where? Where?"

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:41.120
“BF: Okay… now let’s do something about the food in this break”

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:43.660
Ah! Ah! I see, I had a choice...

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:47.680
I should bring it home, right? After I put it in the lunchbox...

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:50.120
I'll choose this...

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:53.580
“BF: Right, let’s put the food in the container and take it home”

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:54.680
That’s right

00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:56.560
Is this okay?

00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:58.980
“GF: Did you already eat it?”

00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:01.120
"Thanks for the food! Next time I want to cook with you!"

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:04.100
"GF: Ah! That sounds fun!"

00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:06.020
I DID IT!

00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:09.640
Man, it's to be expected of me that I managed to discover a secret

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:10.820
Our brains are different!

00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:13.900
Everyone, not all women are like this, this is a special case...

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:15.860
Also, to all the women watching...

00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:18.120
If you’re similar to the girl in the game...

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:19.620
You have some serious problems!

00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:22.320
Take notice of this, take notice of this, yes?

00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:24.500
It looks like there are 10 levels...

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:28.480
So I'd like to beat them... and become the A.I that’s able to...

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:30.180
Understand an annoying woman's heart!

00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:32.900
This was Virtual YouTuber, Kizuna Ai!

00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:34.280
See you later!
