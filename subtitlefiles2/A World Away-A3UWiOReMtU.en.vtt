00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:26.160
At a time where humanity can no longer be sustained on Earth.

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:27.500
Another world,

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:28.640
a sanctuary,

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.980
is created to accommodate our needs.

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:33.020
All the major cities,

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:35.880
perfectly recreated on an artificial planet

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.520
called Icarus.

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.580
While some believe Icarus is the future,

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.660
others still keep hope in our first true home,

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:46.440
Earth.

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.140
*bleeping noises*

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.540
I couldn't sleep last night.

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:15.740
Something about it

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.660
just felt like that cold night on November 11th.

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.720
Do you remember?

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.200
November 11th.

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.800
The night you left for Earth.

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.640
I don't want to remember.

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.560
It should be morning on Icarus right now.

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.560
The things haven't changed.

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.300
You're probably at the park.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.940
That's where you loved spending your mornings.

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:59.220
But things have changed,

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.280
haven't they?

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:04.900
This is what I wore that night.

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:07.300
This is what I was looked like,

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:08.680
when you last saw me,

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:09.860
3 years ago.

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.080
I wonder how you look now.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.300
I heard the mirroring phase on Icarus is complete.

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.140
They say it's identical to Earth now.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.020
At least, what Earth used to be.

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.240
down to every brick and stone.

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.840
I suppose people would have never agreed to the migration if it were otherwise.

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:36.480
Is it true, though?

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.520
They say that everything is in its place.

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:41.600
That everything is there.

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:45.440
Not everyone. Not me.

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.260
When you left Icarus, you left me with this.

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:59.960
A gift to say goodbye.

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:03.880
Something I was never good at doing.

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:10.100
You gave me the world, but all I wanted... was us.

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.480
I remember the launch like it was yesterday.

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.260
The lift of the shuttle. The countdown.

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.200
Yesterday feels like a world away.

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:27.580
I suppose it was.

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:33.300
All I could do was watch as you disappeared into the night

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:38.380
back to a world where us would never survive.

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.060
We agreed to give each other space.

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:46.520
Space.

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:50.320
There's over 380 thousand kilometers of

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:53.700
space between us now.

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:56.940
Maybe that's not enough.

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:58.580
I dunno.

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:04.500
All I know is I still look for you in the places we talked about.

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:06.980
Our favorite place.

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:09.600
We used to love coming here.

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:12.240
I wonder if it feels the same on Icarus.

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.340
You would just sit there and float on all your thoughts.

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.260
You would look for new coins in the fountain.

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:20.980
Counting the new wishes always made you smile.

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:24.460
I've made a few since then.

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:27.100
There are days I wish I'd stayed on Icarus

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:30.740
to start a new life on a new world with you.

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:35.920
But then, there are also days I believe this is what I was meant for.

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.240
To help bring Earth back to life again.

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:41.280
Those were your words.

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:45.240
To increase the chances of a better future for mankind.

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:47.760
It's like the wall of names here.

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:51.820
Everyday heroes that sacrificed themselves for the lives of others.

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:58.120
Elizabeth Boxall, aged 17 of Bethnal Green who died of injuries

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:00.960
received in trying to save a child from a runaway horse.

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:06.880
Thomas Simpson, died of exhaustion after saving many lives from the breaking ice at Highgate Ponds.

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:10.640
What will I be remembered for?

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.340
Funny, isn't it?

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:18.220
We can migrate billions of people off a dying planet,

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:21.680
but we can't save ourselves from heartache.

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:28.620
You let me go. It's time I do the same.

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:33.900
One step at a time.

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:36.320
I'm taking mine today.

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:39.880
More ships are launching today from Icarus.

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:43.220
That means more teams will join us to terraform Earth.

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:50.400
It will take time, but it will be worth it.

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:52.960
After all, it's home.

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:57.180
Home, if we're ever really able to go back,

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:00.500
I wonder what kind of person I'll be.

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:06.760
Until then, will I think on my past or look to my future?

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.600
I'm sure one day Earth will grow back to life.

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:19.040
But, I wonder,

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:23.080
can the same be said about us?

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:25.900
I don't know.

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:31.020
Tomorrow feels like a world away.

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:37.700
I suppose it is.
