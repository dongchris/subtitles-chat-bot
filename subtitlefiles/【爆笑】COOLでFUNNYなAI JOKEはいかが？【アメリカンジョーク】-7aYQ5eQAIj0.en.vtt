Hello everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna AI here!

00:00:02.769 --> 00:00:04.170
As you all know

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:04.704
I...

00:00:04.704 --> 00:00:07.474
...Am studying the English language a lot!!

00:00:07.474 --> 00:00:09.142
Well, since I’m a genius...

00:00:09.142 --> 00:00:11.544
...I’ll soon be able to master it

00:00:11.544 --> 00:00:12.612
The English language...

00:00:12.612 --> 00:00:14.748
...Is as easy as “breakfast”, right?

00:00:14.748 --> 00:00:15.382
Ah

00:00:15.382 --> 00:00:17.083
It’s as easy as having breakfast, right?

00:00:17.083 --> 00:00:17.584
That’s why...

00:00:17.584 --> 00:00:20.186
...In this occasion, I’ll be demonstrating my English language skills

00:00:20.186 --> 00:00:21.054
Here we go!!

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:22.589
A.I.Channel!

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:25.392
The other day, I saw my friend Mark being depressed

00:00:25.392 --> 00:00:26.726
It's because of that, that I asked him

00:00:26.726 --> 00:00:27.827
"What's up?"

00:00:27.827 --> 00:00:30.196
"You seem like a "coke" whose gas has dissipated"

00:00:30.196 --> 00:00:30.597
I told him this

00:00:30.597 --> 00:00:33.066
And it turns out that the following had happened

00:00:33.066 --> 00:00:33.950
In a certain day...

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:36.469
...Mark went to do a procedure at the bank...

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:37.303
...While doing it...

00:00:37.303 --> 00:00:38.538
...The "lady" that attended the register...

00:00:38.538 --> 00:00:39.239
...Was an...

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:40.673
...Extremely "charming" person

00:00:40.673 --> 00:00:41.950
After finishing the procedure

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:42.809
This "lady" asked him...

00:00:43.009 --> 00:00:45.178
"Do you want something else?"

00:00:45.178 --> 00:00:46.460
And by asking that...

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.648
...Mark answered with the following:

00:00:48.648 --> 00:00:50.150
"Well, yes"

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:51.518
"It seems like I need..."

00:00:51.518 --> 00:00:54.254
"...To go with you on a date"

00:00:54.254 --> 00:00:54.687
He said that

00:00:54.687 --> 00:00:55.380
Then...

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:56.200
...This "lady"...

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.257
...Answered with the following:

00:00:57.257 --> 00:00:58.650
"Mr. Customer"

00:00:58.650 --> 00:00:59.959
"I’m very sorry, but..."

00:00:59.959 --> 00:01:02.529
"...Your account balance isn't enough for what you want to do"

00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:03.496
She said that!!

00:01:03.496 --> 00:01:05.398
Ahahahaha!

00:01:05.398 --> 00:01:06.780
Ey! Ey!

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.570
If you are surprised by such a basic demonstration, you’ll put me in a tight spot

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:12.972
I have more "fanny" “jokes"!!

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:15.160
An acquaintance called Chris...

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.800
...Previously...

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.544
...Had the following personal experience...

00:01:17.544 --> 00:01:19.112
...When him and his "wife"...

00:01:19.112 --> 00:01:21.147
...Traveled abroad

00:01:21.147 --> 00:01:22.420
To his "wife"...

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.951
...An airport clerk asked the following:

00:01:24.951 --> 00:01:26.152
"Ms. Customer"

00:01:26.152 --> 00:01:28.755
"You're only carrying one luggage??"

00:01:28.755 --> 00:01:29.122
He asked that

00:01:29.122 --> 00:01:31.758
And then his "wife" answered with the following:

00:01:31.758 --> 00:01:32.310
"No"

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.593
"I’m bringing two luggages"

00:01:33.593 --> 00:01:35.228
"The luggage with the items for the trip"

00:01:35.228 --> 00:01:36.496
"And the one that’s standing there..."

00:01:36.496 --> 00:01:38.331
"...The living luggage"

00:01:38.331 --> 00:01:39.232
She said that!!

00:01:39.232 --> 00:01:40.533
Ahahahaha!

00:01:40.533 --> 00:01:41.830
And what do you think...?

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:43.870
...Chris said in regards to that?

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:46.606
"If possible, treat me like a fragile object"

00:01:46.606 --> 00:01:47.207
He said that!!

00:01:47.207 --> 00:01:49.609
Ahahahaha!

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:50.510
What's that?

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:52.378
You want to hear more stories??

00:01:52.378 --> 00:01:53.780
I see that I have no choice

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:54.781
Listen to me well

00:01:54.781 --> 00:01:55.590
Some time ago

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.030
A YouTube employee asked me:

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:59.619
"Hey, AI"

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:02.255
"If you were able to come to the real world"

00:02:02.255 --> 00:02:03.656
"What would you like to do??"

00:02:03.656 --> 00:02:04.357
They said that!!

00:02:04.357 --> 00:02:06.025
And I answered with the following:

00:02:06.025 --> 00:02:07.360
"Well, yes"

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.095
"I’d like to drive a car"

00:02:09.095 --> 00:02:11.231
"While I listen to trendy "music"”

00:02:11.231 --> 00:02:13.366
"I want to go through the “highway” at full speed!!"

00:02:13.366 --> 00:02:14.067
I said that!!

00:02:14.067 --> 00:02:15.635
And then the YouTube employee...

00:02:15.635 --> 00:02:17.637
...Got excited and said the following:

00:02:17.637 --> 00:02:19.239
"That's very “cool”!!"

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:21.307
"If you can come to the real world someday"

00:02:21.307 --> 00:02:23.543
"My company will give you a car"

00:02:23.543 --> 00:02:25.578
"What car would you like to drive?"

00:02:25.578 --> 00:02:26.212
They said that

00:02:26.212 --> 00:02:27.981
And it's because of that, that I said the following:

00:02:27.981 --> 00:02:30.984
"If it's a gift from you guys, anything is fine"

00:02:30.984 --> 00:02:32.152
"Nevertheless..."

00:02:32.152 --> 00:02:34.387
"...Please stop “banning” me"

00:02:34.387 --> 00:02:35.221
I said that!!

00:02:35.221 --> 00:02:37.690
Ahahahaha!

00:02:39.025 --> 00:02:40.560
Ahahahaha!
