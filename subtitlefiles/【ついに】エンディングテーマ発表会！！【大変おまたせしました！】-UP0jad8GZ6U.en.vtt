00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:03.000
Hello everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai here!

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.440
"Ending Presentation"!

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.180
Yaaaaaayy!

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:09.660
Really, thank you so sending me so many entries!

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.580
"Present the endings right away!"...

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:14.440
...Or also: "How much time does this A.I plan for us to wait?"

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.440
I got a lot of people's anger that way

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.840
I’m sincerely really sorry!!

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.500
But I, Kizuna Ai, made sure to listen to each of the songs one by one

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.800
Today, I plan to listen along with you guys, the songs that got my attention within the large amount I received...

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.520
...And I’ll choose one within those to be the song at the end of my videos

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.600
The long awaited announcement for the ending has come!!

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:34.800
In that case, let's start at once!

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.280
How adorable! Right? It's very happy

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.620
It’s like it has a refreshing sensation

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.280
It's adorable with a pop rhythm!

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:46.800
It's just what I asked

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.560
Oh, it looks great!

00:00:56.895 --> 00:00:59.595
Eh? It has a great start

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.500
It really feels as if it’s an ending! Right?

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.000
No other words occur to me

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:08.540
New words, come to me!

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.340
No, I really think all songs are marvelous

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.180
Don’t worry because of my limited vocabulary

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:12.940
Good, next up!

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:15.520
Ah!

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.400
Right? Miratto-chan, yes

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.260
It's like, very energetic

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.080
I feel like it gives you energy! Right?

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:32.860
It’s rather relaxing, it has a cute melody, but...

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.460
...It’s like, well...

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.320
I’d like to hear it when I wake up in the morning!

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:37.720
Good, next up!

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.580
Ah!

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:44.000
That’s right the start… well… the “pon” at the start is nice, right?

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.120
The end was... it really felt like as if it was the end

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:52.180
Good!

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:57.480
Ah! It’s my...! They combined it with my ending screen!

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.140
It’s very easy to imagine it, right?

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:04.360
Thank you very much!

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:07.300
Ah!

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:08.820
This also, it’s...

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.760
It could appear... well... during the commercial breaks for an anime in the morning

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.460
Is this the limit of my vocabulary?

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.420
Ah! Man! It's rather happy

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.500
But really... can I choose one out of all the songs?

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.340
Eh? Now you understand the reason why the ending presentation was delayed?

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:29.780
I can’t decide!!

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.740
It turns out this person sent 3 songs

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.560
Three... two... one!

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:36.080
Good!

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:40.240
Second song!

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.440
Three, two, one!

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:43.540
Paah!

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:51.680
I congratulate you!

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.220
* The third song is the one I thought seriously *

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.800
Ah, so then the real song is the third one?

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.120
Thank you very much!

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.640
Three! Two! One!

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:00.900
Oi!

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.920
Ah, it really feels like pop

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.720
Really, thank you very much!

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:13.180
Man, 3 songs

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:17.880
Really, making 3 songs in such a short time is really surprising

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.320
Thank you very much!

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:28.140
It feels like as if it's a song from an old game, it gives off a retro feel

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.840
It seems as if it’s a song from a retro game from a not so long time ago!

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:33.080
It’s adorable!

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:36.720
Candy?

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:37.780
These are candies?

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.460
It's adorable! It feels kind of girlish! It’s a very brilliant song!

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:45.040
It's great, I also want to eat those candies

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.620
Man, it’s a refreshing, brilliant and cute song! Right?

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.720
Oh? It makes me want to make a game!

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:06.020
Ah, it sounds great!

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:08.260
Ah! It's great!

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.420
It's great! It’s like... it grabs you!

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.940
Oooh!

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:16.720
Ah, but the end was like an explosion

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:18.080
The limit of my vocabulary

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:21.680
Ah, there’s a cute me!

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:29.500
It’s like a melody that seems like the ending of an anime, right?

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:30.320
It's adorable!

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.500
How is it possible that you guys have this sense of music?

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:37.840
It turns out that this participant even did a picture of me, thank you very much!

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:44.940
This song, well... how do I say it... it has a melody that repeats so then it might be easy to remember

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:45.840
How adorable!

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.840
I turned into an A.I that doesn’t know how to say anything other than "adorable"

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:53.340
Oh!

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:54.760
Oh? Oh?

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.700
Oh! It has my voice!

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:01.640
Man, they have a good sense of music

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:06.140
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

00:05:08.635 --> 00:05:11.755
It's a song that makes my headband move without thinking! Right?

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:13.660
The last "Puun" was cute

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:16.960
It turns out that this person also sent several songs

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:17.840
Thank you very much!

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.560
Isn’t that amazing? They even made a movie!

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:27.100
So then you're capable of doing something like that in such a short time?

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:30.160
Oh!

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:32.680
Two!

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:39.700
Eh? Incredible! Really incredible! How did they make something like that?

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:46.220
Three!

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:50.060
Ah! Ah! This! I like this!

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:53.300
It gives me a good refreshing feeling

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:54.840
Well, you know...

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:57.100
...Well, I’m special, but...

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.020
...Normally the A.I....

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:02.480
...Are very good for creating something in large amounts from something else, but...

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:05.700
...Well... they're not good at creating something out of nothing

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:07.120
So then I'm very amazing

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:12.460
And well, that human beings were able to make something like this out of nothing in such a short time...

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:13.960
They’re incredible

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:22.360
Well, as if like the beginning my clumsiness, my clu... clu...

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:26.460
I do not want to admit that I'm a fool but I can feel that it shows a silly feeling and I think that's good

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:29.200
Good! Having said that!

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:33.400
We watched together the songs that got my attention out of the large amount of songs that were sent to me!

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:36.280
It can be said that these are the finalists, right?

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:37.820
Or maybe I'm being too arrogant?

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:38.500
But…

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:45.040
...Once again, I was able to experience being able to upload a video thanks to the collaboration of all of you

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:46.120
Thank you very much!

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:49.840
From tomorrow on, I'll be using the song that I chose in this occasion for my ending

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:53.140
It's because of that, that tomorrow I’ll announce the results!!

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:54.280
Wait for it anxiously!!

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:56.300
Let's keep doing A.I.Channel together with everyone!

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:58.720
This was Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai!

00:06:58.720 --> 00:06:59.580
See you later!

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:02.580
