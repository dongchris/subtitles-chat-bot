That looks... That looks good. Can you just export that for tomorrow?
Yeah.

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:12.870
Cool. What do you want for lunch? How about... burritos?

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:15.660
No, no... no.

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:19.960
Beans make me gassy.

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:24.540
You know we have restrooms in the office right?
Oh, I don't take number twos in there though.

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.480
Why not?

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:34.200
The lights in the bathroom are motion-sensored and when you're in the stall the lights go off before you can finish...

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.040
...your business.
Well, how long do you need in there?

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:46.770
Then are you afraid of the dark or something?
...No
Then just do it. I want burritos.

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:54.899
Hello? Yes. I would like two bean burritos to-go please. Yeah. Extra frijoles.

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.840
Aw, great.

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.380
Wes?

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.600
Phil?

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.820
Christine?

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.020
*whisper shouting* This is the men's restroom!

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:40.720
BOO!

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.440
*still whispering* Vandalism.

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:46.440
It's scary.

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:47.180
Ah!

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:48.360
Uh!

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.600
No!

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:50.820
*cranking noise*

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.580
Ooh!

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:53.220
Uh!

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:55.400
Wes!

00:01:55.787 --> 00:01:56.627
Oh! Phil!

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.600
Uuuhh!

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:58.500
Uuhh!

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.600
Aah!

00:02:00.033 --> 00:02:00.573
Uh!

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.520
Aah!

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:02.880
*dramatic music crescendos*

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:07.620
I tipped the electrician 20 bucks.

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.840
*panting loudly*

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.799
Is someone hurt in there? I heard a woman scream.

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:27.200
Uh no no no, um, there is a man in there, and... he saw a spider and got scared.

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.400
Wow, that's almost as bad as being scared of the dark.

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:39.549
You know, statistically though, more people die while in the dark than from spider bites, so...

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.609
Anyway, d-do you work in this building?

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:44.940
Yeah, just down the hall.

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.300
Cool! I guess I'll be seeing you around, neighbor.

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.240
Yeah, I guess you will...you know, if the lights are on.

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.300
[RIP Taylor]

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.520
That was scary.
The dark, or the you talking to the girl at the end?

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:04.540
Ha-ha, Phil.

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:07.080
Whoa, well where are we?

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.220
Woah. New venue.
Pretty cool. Wow.

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:10.500
Pretty snazzy.

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:13.800
