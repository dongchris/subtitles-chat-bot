00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.680
Hi there, Virtual Youtuber Kizuna Ai here

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:05.920
Today, I have a big announcement to you all

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:08.780
Somehow, finally, finally, finally

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:12.660
My Kizuna Ai Line stamps are on sale

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:16.880
Today, the 9th of November,

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.140
the Line official stamps will be released

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.440
There will be 24 stamps

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:22.140
and that's not all

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:23.680
they will have voices

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.580
There's a download URL in the description below

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:31.040
The shooting sessions for the stamps were fun

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:32.820
just like gravure shoots

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.360
I also did this and that

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:35.780
for example

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.320
[Hi there!]

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.400
Virtual Youtuber Kizuna Ai

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:40.620
[Good!]

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:43.520
An all-purpose reply

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:44.920
[Yes?]

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.320
It's kind of

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.140
insulting

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:50.280
[I'm sorry]

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.320
Whenever you have a friend get irritated at you

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:54.560
Even if he gets angry, it's gonna be fine

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.040
If you use this, somehow things will work out

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.220
[Crisis averted]

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.620
After the Ai-apology gets you forgiven

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.400
There, crisis averted

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.860
Just don't feel down, and keep staying positive

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:09.520
[a-wha-what?]

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.760
I'm liking the glasses and the bowtie there

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:13.760
[How's that?]

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.700
Look, look

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.100
"The smug face"

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.260
So close

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:23.460
Should I finish him off with the Haoh Sh*****ken?

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.800
[Let's be friends]

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.000
That was a little embarrasing

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.120
[Please wait a moment]

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.620
You can use this stamp for sudden technical difficulties

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:37.740
[It's the best!]

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.740
Even in technical difficulties I can be relied upon

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:41.980
I'm the best!

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:44.300
[It's perfect!]

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.780
In which ever way, this stamp is just perfect

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:50.160
[Guilty]

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.360
You who don't download my stamps are

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.020
Guilty!

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:55.340
[Not guilty]

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:56.840
You who download my stamps

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.060
I pronounce you not guilty!

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.660
[Please~]

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.080
That's why everyone,

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.860
Please~

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.300
Please

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.840
Please download my stamps

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:17.940
and then

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.380
We'll make a second series of stamps?

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.560
If everyone downloads this one?

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.400
No, no, I'm not cocky or anything. I'm sorry

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:31.360
Everyone, please feel free to use or play around with them

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:32.200
That's all

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.380
