00:00:00.275 --> 00:00:02.615
Hello everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna AI here!

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:04.980
The end of the year is now getting closer!

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:05.940
Everyone...!

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:09.120
Are you all prepared to receive the new year?

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:09.900
Hmm...?

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:10.580
Oh?

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:11.180
Hmm...?

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.320
Still aren't? Work hard please, yes?

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:14.260
In Japan...

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:15.960
...People clean their houses...

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:17.420
...Or they place Kadomatsu
(Traditional Japanese decoration)

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:20.800
It seems that you have to make a lot of preparations to receive the new year, right?

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.720
Within the events of the end of the year...

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.580
...The one that intrigues me is...!

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:25.380
...The Nengajou!

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:26.580
The Nengajou is...

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.420
...A Japan custom...

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:31.760
...In which you place feelings of gratitude...

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:33.300
...And your best wishes for the new year in a letter...

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.540
...And you send them to those people that helped you during the year
*Gajou: Letter of Celebration*

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.920
A culture in which the connections between people are treasured...

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.860
...I like that!

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.400
It's because of that, that in this occasion...

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.460
...Iâ€™m going to challenge myself to make a Nengajou

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.420
In that case, Iâ€™ll start at once-degozaruyo!

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:53.180
In this occasion, Iâ€™ll use this website called "Webpo"

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:55.840
And Iâ€™ll make a Nengajou online

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.920
Oh! "Free Test"!

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:58.940
Thanks!

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:01.500
Good, here I go!

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:02.100
Tou!

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.060
It's great that you can apply one as a test, right?

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.100
Mmm... mmm... I see...

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.115
First, I should go... here-degozaruna?

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:12.340
I see!

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.600
This is really adorable!

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.980
Itâ€™s an adorable design-degozaruno!

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.760
Mmm... I wonder which should I choose

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.000
This is adorable-degozaruna!

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.500
These... puppies...

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.080
These are...

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.040
...Photographs that all the human beings have done-degozaru?

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.100
This is...

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:31.860
...Rather admirable!

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.600
Well, yes...

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:41.320
I suppose Iâ€™ll choose this austere letter of celebration that moved my samurai soul

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:42.880
"Printing with margen"

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.000
Tou!

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.840
Oh!

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:46.740
Next up, I should include the greeting, correct?

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:47.340
Correct?

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:48.600
"Greeting"

00:01:48.935 --> 00:01:49.935
"Hello everyone!"

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.900
"Congratulations for the new year!"

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.320
"Iâ€™ll be counting on you in this new year as well!"

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:57.560
Is that good?

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:59.080
OK-degozaru!

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.840
Nin nin!
(Phrases said by ninjas)

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.200
"Add the sender address"

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:04.040
Sender...

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.360
But, since Iâ€™m a virtual being...

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.000
...I donâ€™t have an address, so then...

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.440
...Well, for the moment, Iâ€™ll ignore it

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:12.580
Oh! Whatâ€™s this? What's this?

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:13.520
I see!

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.140
I should input the destination address, right?

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:18.240
Oh!

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.840
This is really overwhelming-degozaruna! (?)

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.740
A friend that knows your address-degozaru?

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.860
Address...!

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:27.580
Address?

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:28.420
Address!

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:29.840
Eh... address

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.180
Address...

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.580
A friend that knows...

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.200
...Your address...

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:42.240
My... friend?

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:43.340
Hmm...

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:44.400
Fri...

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:46.660
...end...

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.220
ðŸ˜­

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:53.260
Fri...

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.820
Friend!

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.260
I want to have friends! ðŸ˜­

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.360
