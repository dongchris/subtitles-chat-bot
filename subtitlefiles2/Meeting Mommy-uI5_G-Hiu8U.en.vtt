00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:05.660
Hey everyone this is Sima Leo and Tina Jung, and this is their short film meeting mommy. Hope you like it!

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:14.260
Daddy!

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.260
Hi baby

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:21.640
Happy birthday. I am not a baby anymore, I'm 6.

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.540
You'll always be daddy's, baby

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.800
What time is it? Lunch time.

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.620
It's an early lunch, now come on!

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.040
You sure you brushed your teeth?

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:50.560
Good girl. Daddy I have a question. Fire away monkey. Why did you marry mommy?

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:52.580
Mmm

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:58.819
Because mommy was the most amazing human being that daddy had ever met. Did you love her? Of course.

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.180
Hey, why don't I do your hair?

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:08.580
Anything you want your french braid or how about a half up? No. Thank you. Let's go make lunch. I want to see mommy.

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:12.760
So grilled cheese, huh?

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.620
I didn't touch the knife or the stove.

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.630
Good girl

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:24.560
Daddy, I have another question. Of course you do. How come I can only see mommy once every year?

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.660
Because mommy can't be here very often, Zoey.

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:29.660
Okay

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.640
We have been through this babe. Mommy went away.

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.420
Weren't you sad when she went away?

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:48.740
Yeah, I was very sad. Were you mad? For a long time, yeah.

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:57.620
But, that's life Zoey sometimes things happen that are outside of your control and you have to choose not to be angry about it forever.

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.080
Otherwise, daddy would just be a big grump all the time.

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:07.980
Ketchup?

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:23.140
Come on, lunch is ready. Daddy, you forgot to make one for mommy.

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.900
You and I can share.

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:31.330
Come on, let's go.

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:43.020
Ready?

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:49.920
Hi monkey. Hi mommy. Happy birthday!

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:55.480
I bet daddy got you a nice big ice cream cake to share with all your friends.

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:03.760
Can't believe you're turning six today. You must be so big and strong and beautiful.

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:14.000
Zoe this videos gonna be a little different from the usual, okay? But just know that mommy loves you so so much.

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:21.600
Maybe I wish I was with you right now, but sometimes that universe has different plans for us.

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:25.040
And our wishes don't always come true.

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:35.580
Daddy and I are so happy to bring you into this world.

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.540
But mommy's body isn't working right?

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:56.220
There's something else growing in me something that's making mommy very, very sick.

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.160
Something called cancer.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.140
See cancer isn't like getting the chickenpox or the sniffles.

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:15.000
Mommy has a very rare type of cancer. It was very hard to get better from.

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:25.020
And I'm afraid that my time on earth is almost up.

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:29.640
I wish I can see you ride your first bike...

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:33.040
Take you to dance practice...

00:05:36.319 --> 00:05:38.319
Hold you when you're hurting...

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:47.980
But just because I won't be here with you doesn't mean you have to grow up without a mommy.

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:51.820
Are you ready for your present?

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:26.829
These disks contain everything I know about growing up.

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:34.640
I want to teach you to work hard and achieve your goals and dreams, whatever they may be.

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:39.480
Do not be afraid of failing and looking foolish.

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:51.440
I want to teach you about love so that someday you can marry the man of your dreams, or woman, that's okay too.

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:59.780
I pray that you'll live in a world where words like feminist and women's rights are no longer needed.

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:06.240
But just in case, I want to teach you what they mean, and why they're important to me.

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:08.940
But most importantly...

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:16.340
I want you to know that whenever you're feeling lost or alone? I will be right here for you.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
All you have to do is press play.

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:25.780
Happy birthday, baby. I will always love you.

00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:43.660
Zoey...

00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:47.140
Do you have cancer too daddy?

00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:51.580
No monkey. I am not going anywhere.

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:55.760
Can you take medicine for cancer?

00:07:57.020 --> 00:08:02.660
Well, yes. But why didn't mommy take medicine for her cancer?

00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:10.060
Well it's complicated, Zoey, she couldn't. Was it because of me?

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
Zoey...

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:26.100
The day you were born, you gave mommy the greatest gift she ever could have asked for and we wouldn't have risked that for anything.

00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:32.600
The doctor told us that mommy didn't have a lot of time left after you were born.

00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:34.860
But because of you,

00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:37.020
she fought to be here to support you...

00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:40.620
to feed you.

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:45.680
Because of you, I was able to hang on to her for so much longer.

00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:51.400
You've saved mommy's life, do you understand?

00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:55.620
She lives inside you.

00:08:57.010 --> 00:08:59.010
Right here.

00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:02.820
I love you daddy. I love you too, babe.

00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:27.740
Daddy? Yeah, baby. This one is for you.

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:41.580
Zoey. I think I'm gonna go upstairs for a bit daddy.

00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:12.400
Hi John. *laughs*

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:13.260
Hi baby.

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:15.360
Hey, don't act so surprised.

00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:18.970
Okay, you're probably wondering what this is?

00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:22.080
I love you, so much.

00:10:22.420 --> 00:10:24.880
And I know you're doing a great job.

00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:27.700
You need a reminder.

00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:31.760
Because you're gonna be hard on yourself. I'm proud of you, baby.

00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:21.120
Well hope you guys like that I know for sure that when I first watched it, I was like crying. I was like holding back tears crying. Great job, first of all. Thank you.

00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:27.280
Congratulations. Thank you. You guys are the writers of this and but you guys also starred in it.

00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:31.860
So you guys were wearing a lot of hats of really really amazing work. Thank you.

00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:37.480
I have so many things to ask about this because it's a type of story that we haven't really had on Wong Fu before.

00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:41.480
Which is a big reason why I was drawn to

00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:46.160
wanting to share with our fans. I guess first of all like what was the inspiration behind?

00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:50.200
This story or wanting to even make this film.

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:55.240
It's it's so funny that you say that you know it hasn't been something that was done before because it actually

00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:59.739
We're so inspired by the work that one food was done in the past with your short films. Oh

00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:03.430
Phil is not paying me to say this about

00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:09.130
But I love Wang Fu's ability to just like have a real human moment on screen

00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:14.290
and so I think that was kind of our first goal was to just be able to move our audience and

00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:19.179
Hopefully we've succeeded, but you know it was just the two of us a couple of you know actors

00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:20.240
just trying to

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:26.320
Think of a script that they would be able to act together in you know for some reason or another we settled on this

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:32.020
relationship between a mother and her child and more specifically focusing on her love and and just how

00:12:32.390 --> 00:12:34.660
Transcendent and powerful that love is right

00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:40.420
I mean this idea of like the the lessons in this booklet like per year was like I oh I thought that was just so

00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:42.459
Creative it made me actually want to just do that anyways

00:12:43.070 --> 00:12:47.950
I'm not you know like thankfully like I'm still here, but it's like maybe I should just do this in case

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:51.520
It's like weird like how did that idea come up was just something you guys just

00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:57.300
Aha moment um. I I want to put it in because personally for me

00:12:57.420 --> 00:13:01.380
I love making scrapbooks and stuff, but like from a personal level like that

00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:02.230
That's something

00:13:02.230 --> 00:13:07.780
I would do putting myself in those shoes like because you know if you're giving it to like a six-year-old you have to

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:10.800
frame it in a way that they would understand it alright.

00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:14.320
it's kind of like okay like I know you I know how you're gonna grow up as.

00:13:14.540 --> 00:13:19.840
Let me put stuff in that you're gonna relate to on that level and also transcend throughout the years

00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:24.040
Yeah, I definitely remember when I first pitched that part of this story

00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:28.320
I was like what if it's just like a book of DVDs, and you're like no, no, no.

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:39.540
It's all on the cloud have you have either your mom's I feel like I'm guessing they've all watches it they have

00:13:44.780 --> 00:13:48.790
Their they're also very supportive yeah, my mom no my mom gave me no it's just oh

00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:52.060
Yeah, but she loves doing that that's her way of showing love.

00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:56.320
And I understand we got to talk about the Zoey character played by Rebecca.

00:13:56.680 --> 00:14:00.180
How did you guys find her she did such an amazing job! [Tina] She did.

00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:06.720
Working with kids is such a challenge sometimes especially the younger they go, so yep. Just tell us about working with Rebecca

00:14:06.910 --> 00:14:08.720
We got lucky um,

00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:14.980
Cuz she came to set she came on set the first day memorized her line. Not only her lines about our lines as well

00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:19.720
[Phil] Oh my gosh. And whenever we had like an NG or whenever. She'd be like no. No it's a sign

00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:21.720
She would give us like a line read

00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:27.880
[Simu] She was our script supervisor. [Tina] She didn't let us go off script by even one single word.

00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:30.640
It was too embarrassing.

00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:48.340
So the director Tricia who's not here with us today like she's a friend of yours. How'd you guys decide to work with her?

00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:54.070
She's also Asian herself like, what was the process of work like collaborating with her as well?

00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:58.149
You know Trisha was just a part of our network in Canada

00:14:58.150 --> 00:15:02.379
And we were you know we were friends before and I you know when I write things

00:15:02.380 --> 00:15:05.290
I like to share it so you know as soon as I wrote the script like I shared it with you

00:15:05.290 --> 00:15:05.650
Yeah

00:15:05.650 --> 00:15:10.750
I shared it with a bunch of friends of mine and not thinking that you know I would get my director out of it

00:15:10.750 --> 00:15:12.550
But actually Trisha read it

00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:16.959
And it turns out that she had a very deep and personal connection with the source material

00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:21.249
And so she immediately messaged me back and was like I don't know if you found a director yet

00:15:21.350 --> 00:15:24.579
But I would love to come aboard and and seeing her

00:15:25.070 --> 00:15:31.360
kind of passion and initiative like I knew that I had to I had to have her and we we had to have her because

00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:33.640
There was just something about

00:15:33.890 --> 00:15:38.710
Her response that kind of clued us into the fact that it meant more to her especially.

00:15:38.710 --> 00:15:43.300
It's just something personal way, and I really like brought her in yeah, that's that's really great.

00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:48.579
So you just mentioned that you know this your network in Canada for those of you guys that don't know these two are our

00:15:48.940 --> 00:15:52.000
friends up north from Canada, we're Canucks!

00:15:52.340 --> 00:15:54.640
And they're Asian Canadians

00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:58.330
And we're all is talking about like Asian American issues or

00:15:58.550 --> 00:16:03.129
Representation in media like do you kind of feel the same way up there like do you feel like we're kind of in the same?

00:16:04.010 --> 00:16:10.420
Boat and the same struggles? I mean totally, totally I mean you you know that you know the U.S.

00:16:10.420 --> 00:16:14.259
Is a major exporter of culture and as you know being your neighbors,

00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:19.480
We consume a lot of it so all you know we consume all the same stuff you guys do we feel the same frustration and

00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:22.089
You know we fight the same battles

00:16:22.090 --> 00:16:28.179
And you know I'm lucky and actually we're both lucky to be a part of a show in Canada called Kim's convenience that

00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:32.499
That does feature kind of an Asian Canadian family as its main cast

00:16:33.170 --> 00:16:38.979
but that's just you know that's just one step in in a battle that that needs to be fought over a long time and the

00:16:38.980 --> 00:16:43.329
I'm glad that you know we we want to be supportive of like you know creators from not just

00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:48.280
America whatever you know we want we know that there's great creators all over the world you know so it's

00:16:48.350 --> 00:16:49.270
definitely support of that

00:16:49.270 --> 00:16:54.129
And I think it's also great that you know you guys also got women of color involved as well in this project

00:16:54.130 --> 00:16:59.170
and it's it's just really great to see that you guys brought on all these different aspects and

00:16:59.750 --> 00:17:04.570
We're really proud to share this with our with our audience. Thank you. Thank you. We're still starstruck.

00:17:04.630 --> 00:17:09.080
It is still so surreal that we are sitting in Wong Fu's office with Phil, no not at all.

00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:13.429
If you want to follow, what Simu and Tina are up to be sure to look at the links below.

00:17:13.620 --> 00:17:20.690
They're doing amazing things. We got Kim's convenience watch their show if you're in Canada. They got two seasons already out. That's incredible.

00:17:21.390 --> 00:17:26.180
Congratulations, and thanks you guys again for being here. Thank you to see you, and we'll see you guys next time.
