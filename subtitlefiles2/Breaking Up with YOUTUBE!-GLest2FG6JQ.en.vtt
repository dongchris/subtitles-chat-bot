00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:11.340
Hey, you ...

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:15.210
tube

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.670
I don't even know where to start we've

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.650
been together for almost 12 years now

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:20.820
wow

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.740
and I think it's pretty clear that we

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.590
both grown and you've changed quite a

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.349
lot. When we first got together it was so

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.990
much fun so exciting it was like

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.189
anything goes

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.850
carefree. know but now there's all these

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.470
new rules that i have to follow just to

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:40.410
be with you. I know I know the rules are

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.120
because well you're giving me part of your

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.210
paycheck and its really generous so it

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.739
makes sense

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.250
adsense. But the money and the gifts it's

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.010
nice and all but that's not why i first

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.239
fell in love with you

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.300
there's all these people that are taking

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.920
advantage of your generosity now and

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.989
you're letting it change you

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.870
I mean since when did you like hanging

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.060
out with petty drama queens and crazy

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.950
celebrities and people that just want to

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.110
use you to get popular you know I know

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.220
you're in like the entertainment

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.720
business now and you gotta rub elbows

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.000
with these people but you treat me

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.740
differently around them

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.680
yes you do like just to see you have to

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.530
go through that algo rhythm guy what's

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.220
the name again, Al? He always makes me such

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.810
a low priority and sometimes completely

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.509
forgets about me. We practically never see

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:31.259
each other

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.659
no no no don't tell me that we spend

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.180
lots of time together for me it's about

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.490
quality not quantity

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:39.990
I mean you tell me you want to see me

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.490
daily, but what's the point of all we're

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:42.930
doing is opening snacks and trying to

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.200
swallow cinnamon? Maybe that's enough for

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.520
you in a relationship and i'm not saying

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.250
that that's not fun sometimes but I need

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.219
more depth. I need to feed my creativity

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:55.560
and I know we come across a lot of

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.650
challenges

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:04.190
we don't have to let those limit us and

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.020
I don't know if you noticed but a lot of

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.000
our friends are kind of mad at you too

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.530
they say you're doing everything wrong

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.180
in this relationship and I still defend

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.870
you but I'm not gonna lie I have been

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.840
tempted I mean facebook has been

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.550
flirting with me a lot these days I'm

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:21.020
sure you've noticed because let's face

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:22.910
it she sucks at keeping anything private

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:24.770
but she gives me a lot of attention

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:26.240
mine was a close call, yes, but we talked

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:27.830
for like six seconds that was it like

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.650
she doesn't even exist to me anymore but a

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.709
instagram is has got a lot of work done

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:37.370
Not gonna lie she looks great, and netflix ..... O-okay

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.200
look, look, look,  I'm sorry ,okay? I'm sorry but you

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.450
can't blame me for wanting to change if

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:46.600
you're going to...

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.220
If you don't want me to change then

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:51.400
need you to focus on us.  Ignore all the

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.100
noise and all the distractions...

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.140
All the people trying to trick you and and buy

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:57.680
your affection

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.440
I'm still here

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.140
Are you processing this?

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:18.980
Guy's, he's doing it again..

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:21.240
Every time we upload...

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:23.080
Phil! Stop it!

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:30.820

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:45.520
we're gonna come across a lot of

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:47.360
challenges

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:58.100

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:05.160

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:11.330
enjoyed our first sketch of the new year

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:12.580
yeah we know it's a little different

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:14.590
from our normal stuff, but ah I think you know

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:15.670
but, we've all kind of notice that there's

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:17.830
been a lot of talk about YouTube these

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:20.020
days, if it's broken or problems, drama

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:21.850
view counts, all the stuff

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:23.290

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:24.850
and a lot of people have been talking about YouTube

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:26.800
we decided to talk to youtube

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.240
So this video was just kind of our take on it

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:29.680
but honestly we don't really want to get

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.300
caught up and all that stuff

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:32.920
Um, we just want to stay focused on making good
