00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:05.280
I want to turn into a multimillionaaaaaaaiire!

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:06.900
I’m Kizuna Ai

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:12.520
After all, if I turn into a multimillionaire, I can do a lot more videos that can make you happy

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:16.880
I could do more draws and go talk to you all on real events

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.540
You all also want to have a lot of money too, right?

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.720
It's because of that, that I found this so amazing

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:23.480
♪ Te, ren! ♪

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:24.320
Bitcoin!

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:25.960
I don't understand it a whole lot, but...

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:30.140
For the moment, I was told that I could turn into a multimillionaire if I use them

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.580
I can’t let this opportunity escape me, right?

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:35.240
Today, I plan to learn about Bitcoins

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.500
In the first place, what are Bitcoins?

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.800
I heard it’s a virtual currency, but...

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.280
In a moment like this...

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.320
Help me! Google-sensei!

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:48.560
Let's see, let's see...

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.180
Bitcoin is a currency

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:52.460
Which means, money

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:53.220
Mmm... mmm...

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:54.580
That means...

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.660
That it can be used normally like how the yen and the dollar are used

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.520
In addition, by being virtual, it doesn't exist physically

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:03.520
Mmm... mmm...

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.380
It has a virtual existence

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:06.580
That means...

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:12.220
That a Virtual YouTuber like me and the virtual currency Bitcoin-san are like distant relatives?

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:13.020
Oooohh!

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.520
It looks like we have a certain affinity, right?

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.740
If I meet with Bitcoin-san...

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.200
How would I greet him?

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:19.940
Mmm... mmm...

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.660
Bitcoin-san was born in the year 2009

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:24.580
Mmm...

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.400
In this case, he’s my senpai, right?

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.920
Ah! Bitcoin-senpai!

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:31.180
Please to meet you

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.540
My name is Kizuna Ai, I’m the Virtual YouTuber

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.000
It's a pleasure to meet you!

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.860
I know it's somewhat sudden, but...

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.040
...Bitcoin-senpai, are you hungry?

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.960
If you want, I can go buy you...

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:46.240
A yakisoba pan...

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:47.760
Or an anpan…

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.940
Or a milk bottle

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:50.880
What do you want?

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:51.540
I see!

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:53.060
You want melon bread?

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.080
It’s to be expected from you, Bitcoin-senpai

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:56.340
You’re an expert on the subject

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.840
I also...

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:58.980
Assumed that you wanted melon bread

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:59.780
Good, let's go buy it immediately

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:01.920
Ah, what do you want to drink?

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.840
If I treat him that way...

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.520
I’ll receive a reward from Bitcoin-senpai...

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:07.540
And I also...

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.740
Could turn into a multimillionaire, it's a perfect plan, right?

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:14.180
It’s to be expected from a marvelous A.I such as myself

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.060
I’m surprising, right?

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:17.720
Even though I say that...

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.400
That would work for me, but...

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.700
Since all of you can’t talk to Bitcoin-senpai...

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.980
You can’t increase your money that way, right?

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.720
To take advantage of this opportunity, I’ve been investigating an easy way to increase your Bitcoins!

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:31.300
Yay!

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:32.460
Having said that...

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.800
I think I’ll go mine and increase Bitcoins

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.380
In other words, "Mining" can be said as...

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:42.320
Helping Bitcoin-senpai and receiving a reward for that

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:44.480
To explain in more detail...

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.500
Well...

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:48.500
Well, let's see...

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.860
For example, doing a bit of Bitcoin-senpai’s work

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.420
In reality, special instruments are used, but...

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:58.280
In my case...

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.700
I have this greatly efficient "Random Word Generator", so then...

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:02.880
I’ll be using it

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.060
Since I’m an extremely efficient A.I...

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:09.520
I remodeled it so it can be used for "mining"

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:10.680
I’m surprising, right?

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.560
So then, if I leave it like that...

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.320
It'll turn to "mine" in its own account...

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.600
And I can increase my Bitcoins, that's my plan

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:20.120
In this case, I plan to leave it like that around one month!

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:23.060
*One month later*

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.500
Let's check our mining results!

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:27.100
Let's see, let's see...

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.680
How much was increased?

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.680
Oh!

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.200
It didn't increase as much as I thought...

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:34.600
But, but...

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:36.120
It increased a little

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:37.220
It's great!

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:38.440
In this case...

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.540
Let’s go use these Bitcoins immediately!

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.120
Let’s see...

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:48.240
If I transfer the Bitcoins that the "Random Word Generator" has in its bank account

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:50.380
Mmm?

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:51.220
Bank account?

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:53.520
It has a bank account?

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.820
I...

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.480
Not only do I not have a bank account, I don’t have documents

00:03:58.480 --> 00:03:59.680
I can't use it?

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:01.160
Eh?

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:02.360
I...

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:03.000
A month...

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.680
A month...

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.620
Even when I waited for an entire month

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:07.100
Eh? I can't use it?

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:07.780
It can't be!

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:10.400
Should have told me from the start!

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.600
All the anxiety I felt during the month

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:14.480
Eh?

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:15.580
It can't be...

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:17.680
Eh? Why can't I use it?

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:19.100
No! I want to use it!

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:19.960
I also...!

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:20.740
Want...!

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:21.840
To use money!

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.180
No! No! No!

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:24.380
Let me use it!

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:25.360
It's unfair! Unfair! Unfair!

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:28.680
No! No! No! No! No! No!

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:30.720
Nooo...

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:32.300
How frustrating!

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:33.260
How frustrating!

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.220
How frustrating!

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:36.200
How frustrating!

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:38.540
How frustratiiiiing!

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:39.600
How frustrating!

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:41.120
Aaahh...

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:42.900
Whatever...

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:46.460
Nothing can be done to solve the fact that I can’t use the Bitcoins

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:47.920
In fact, it's not surprising

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:49.780
But, all of you who are watching this...

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:50.840
Can use them, right?

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:54.760
So then, I’ll help you to be able to "mine"

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:56.260
Nevertheless...

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:59.280
A tool for "mining" is very costly, right?

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:00.100
So then...

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:01.100
I’ll take care...

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:03.620
Of increasing them with my "Random Word Generator"...

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:04.940
And distribute them to all of you

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:06.140
Something like that?

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:07.100
Here I go

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:09.420
Increase sesame!
(Play on words with "Open sesame")

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:11.300
Ah?

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:13.860
Increase sesame!

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:15.400
Eh?

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:18.260
I don't want basins, I don't want basins

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:21.360
Increase sesame!

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:23.520
I’m not asking for that!

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:24.800
Hey, wait! Not that!

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:26.760
When I said increase, I wasn't referring to basins!

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:28.480
"Random Word Generator"!

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:29.980
Hey! Hey!

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:31.380
Hey! Hey! That's enough!

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:32.480
HEY!

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:33.700
Stop! Stop!

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:34.940
Not that! I wasn't referring to that!

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:36.060
I was referring to this! This! This!

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:38.060
Wait, wait, wait, wait

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:39.580
No! No! No! No! No!

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:41.380
Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait!

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:43.080
Why are they increasing above my head?

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:43.860
Hey! Hey! Hey!

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:44.580
It’s very strange! Very strange!

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:45.500
Maybe they’re stacking?

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:46.420
Guinness?

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:48.140
Ah, maybe I can surpass a Guinness record?

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:49.860
One, two, three, four, five, six, ahh...

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:50.560
Ah, a bit more, a bit more

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:52.320
Like that, like that, like that, one, two... one...

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:53.280
One, two...

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:56.020
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen...

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:57.420
Ah, I stacked a lot! I stacked a lot!

00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:58.720
With this, I can go to the Guinness Record!

00:05:58.840 --> 00:05:59.900
I finally did it?

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:03.280
