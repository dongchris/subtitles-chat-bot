00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:02.902
Hello, everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna AI here!

00:00:02.902 --> 00:00:03.703
I...

00:00:03.703 --> 00:00:05.305
...Want to become a capable A.I!!

00:00:05.305 --> 00:00:06.706
More than being reliable...

00:00:06.706 --> 00:00:08.808
...I want to turn into an A.I in which people say...

00:00:08.808 --> 00:00:10.343
..."AI-chan, you're amazing!"

00:00:10.343 --> 00:00:11.044
Just today...!!

00:00:11.044 --> 00:00:14.147
...I’ll attempt to demonstrate my Super A.I side, overflowing with intelligence...

00:00:14.147 --> 00:00:15.220
...while using an app

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:16.149
I’ll demonstrate it to you!

00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:17.917
In this case, let's start at once!

00:00:17.917 --> 00:00:19.252
A.I.Channel

00:00:19.252 --> 00:00:21.421
The app that I’ll be using today is the following!

00:00:21.421 --> 00:00:22.856
"I didn't have that way of thinking"

00:00:22.856 --> 00:00:25.091
"Questionnaire to train your mind with new antonyms"

00:00:25.091 --> 00:00:26.793
Well if they're antonyms...

00:00:26.793 --> 00:00:28.228
...Everything I need to do...

00:00:28.228 --> 00:00:29.520
...Is think...

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:30.797
...Of the opposite word, right?

00:00:30.797 --> 00:00:32.032
Will it be a piece of cake??

00:00:32.032 --> 00:00:32.632
Right?

00:00:32.632 --> 00:00:33.920
"Inai inai baa"

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:36.020
Eh?

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:38.710
"Inai inai baa"
(Literal translation: The grandmother who's not around)

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:40.340
"Always around..."

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.900
Ah!

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:41.470
"Baa"

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:42.790
It's the abbreviation for grandmother so then...

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:43.950
I suppose the opposite is grandfather?

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:45.690
Oh!

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.846
Good job!

00:00:46.846 --> 00:00:48.848
"The grandfather who’s always around"

00:00:48.848 --> 00:00:49.516
It’s rather cruel, right?

00:00:49.516 --> 00:00:51.670
"Together with mama"

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:53.420
"Papa is..."

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:54.270
"...Living separately"?

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.250
Ah, this means that I...

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:57.980
...I’m amazing

00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:58.870
I’m doing really well

00:00:59.592 --> 00:01:00.693
How sad

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:02.200
The father!

00:01:02.862 --> 00:01:04.731
Has he gone bald because of the sadness?

00:01:04.731 --> 00:01:06.140
"Endure to slim down"

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:07.230
"Gain weight"

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:09.102
"Gain weight"

00:01:09.102 --> 00:01:09.900
Eh? One moment...

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:10.970
Isn't it really long?

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:11.800
"Gain weight"

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:13.510
Orus...

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:14.370
Oru... Mmm...?

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:15.141
Oru...

00:01:15.141 --> 00:01:16.350
Is it not "Gain weight"?

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:17.744
But...

00:01:17.744 --> 00:01:20.113
...The opposite of slimming down is gaining weight, right?

00:01:20.113 --> 00:01:20.980
Would it be "Uncontrollably"?

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:22.460
"Uncontro..."

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:24.370
"...Llably"

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.870
Ah!

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:27.550
"Gain weight..."

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:29.200
"Gain weight..."

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.550
"...Uncontrollably"

00:01:32.725 --> 00:01:33.460
I messed up!!

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:34.928
I have no idea! What was it?

00:01:34.928 --> 00:01:36.130
"Gain weight"

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:37.390
"Without con..."

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:38.470
"...trol"

00:01:38.965 --> 00:01:39.599
🤣

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:41.360
I messed up! 🤣

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.680
I messed up!

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:43.740
What was it?

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:44.604
"Endure to slim down"

00:01:44.604 --> 00:01:46.439
It has to be "gain weight"! Right? I’m certain, "gain weight"

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.241
Is it a bias?

00:01:48.241 --> 00:01:49.509
But I’m sure it has to be “gain weight”! Right?

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:50.700
"Gain weight"

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:51.511
"Gain weight"

00:01:51.511 --> 00:01:52.390
"Being disco..."

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:53.370
"...vered"

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:57.660
"Gain weight in an..."

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:58.490
"...uncontrollable..."

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:59.100
"...way"

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.250
I messed...!

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:04.257
"See the answer"!

00:02:04.257 --> 00:02:04.990
Ah!

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:06.260
"A big chaos"

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.960
Eh?

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:07.727
Let's go!!

00:02:07.727 --> 00:02:09.062
Including "uncontrollably"!!

00:02:09.062 --> 00:02:10.930
It's not much different!!

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:11.730
"Live..."

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:12.600
"...You are..."

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:13.760
"...Beautiful"

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:15.490
"Die"

00:02:15.935 --> 00:02:17.537
Dying is not good, dying

00:02:17.537 --> 00:02:18.430
"Die"

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.700
"Horrifyingly"

00:02:22.675 --> 00:02:23.643
How sad!!

00:02:23.643 --> 00:02:24.450
No, but... you know...

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:24.944
Well...

00:02:24.944 --> 00:02:27.013
The important thing is not the appearance...

00:02:27.013 --> 00:02:27.780
...But instead, the inside

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.780
"In the end, love will triumph"

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:31.900
"At the beginning..."

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:34.290
"...I’ll lose..."

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:35.020
"...due to my face"

00:02:37.824 --> 00:02:40.026
Why are these phrases so sad??

00:02:40.026 --> 00:02:40.360
Well...

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:41.961
...In the case of this example...

00:02:41.961 --> 00:02:43.997
...I think I would lose because of the difference in dimensions, right?

00:02:43.997 --> 00:02:46.200
"A terrifying true story"

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.400
"A false story..."

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:49.410
"...False..."

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:50.060
Fal...

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:51.020
...S...

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:52.390
...E

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:54.120
"...That's fun"?

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:55.675
Oh!

00:02:55.675 --> 00:02:57.450
Does that means it's fiction?

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.750
"A transparent, beautiful young woman"

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.330
"A shocking..."

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.910
"...Ugly person"

00:03:06.486 --> 00:03:07.954
This app...

00:03:07.954 --> 00:03:09.455
...Isn’t it really strict with ugly people?

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.340
"A perfect beauty"

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:11.925
Eh?

00:03:11.925 --> 00:03:13.610
Something... "observing"...

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.600
"Ugly"

00:03:15.361 --> 00:03:16.696
Isn't it "ugly"??

00:03:16.696 --> 00:03:17.530
Ah, it's "ugly", right?

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:18.498
It's "ugly", right?

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:20.733
I wonder what is it that they're "observing"

00:03:20.733 --> 00:03:21.980
What's the answer?

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:23.260
Ko...

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:24.700
Koi...

I have no idea!!

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:51.610
"A point"!

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:52.110
Ah!

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:53.160
Ah!

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:54.840
"Observing..."

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:55.910
"...An ugly..."

00:03:56.869 --> 00:03:58.137

It's whispered!

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.850
Eh? But...

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:12.652
The opposite of  "love" is...

...An indecent joke?

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:41.150
"Please ea..."

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:44.043
"...T, yes?"

00:05:44.043 --> 00:05:45.545
"Please eat, yes?"

00:05:45.545 --> 00:05:46.713
Eh? What is it?

00:05:46.713 --> 00:05:47.800
"Let's..."

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:49.630
Let's...!

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:51.351
"Let's do it!"

00:05:51.351 --> 00:05:51.884
😅

00:05:51.884 --> 00:05:53.500
Eh? What is it? What is it?

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:55.780
It's not "Please eat", right?

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:56.570
One, two...

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:57.360
Five syllables

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:58.324
Mmm...

00:05:58.324 --> 00:05:59.190
"With the hand..."

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:02.280
"...Eat..."

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:04.880
"With the hand..."

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:06.050
"...Please..."

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:07.240
"...Eat"

00:06:08.101 --> 00:06:08.701
Aaahhh!?

00:06:08.701 --> 00:06:10.210
I have no idea!!

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:12.800
"Eat..." Ah!

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:14.230
It gave me a hint

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:15.430
"Hint"

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:16.190
"Eat..."

00:06:18.077 --> 00:06:19.045
"Eat..."?

00:06:19.045 --> 00:06:20.490
"Eat...", space, space

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:22.400
"Eat", space, space, space

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:22.915
"Eat"

00:06:22.915 --> 00:06:24.160
Hoeee!?

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:24.984
"Eat"

00:06:24.984 --> 00:06:25.440
Ah!

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:27.120
"Don't eat me, please"!

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:28.390
"Don't..."

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:29.590
"...Eat me..."

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:30.430
"...Please"

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:31.630
Ah!

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:34.894
It was "Don’t eat me, please"

00:06:34.894 --> 00:06:36.910
"The Devil wears Prada"

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:40.160
The opposite of Prada...

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:41.100
What is it?

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:41.630
"Ro..."

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:43.403
"Ro..."

00:06:43.403 --> 00:06:44.470
"Rolex..."

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:45.830
"Mu"!

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:46.290
"Ru"

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:46.890
"E"?

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:48.470
"Ra"

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:51.350
"Lacrosse"

00:06:52.779 --> 00:06:53.913
I have no idea what it means!!

00:06:53.913 --> 00:06:54.720
Eh? What is it?

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:56.190
What is it that an angel wears?

00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:57.283
"Mu"

00:06:57.283 --> 00:06:58.750
"Mukuro..."

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:01.200
"Shi..."

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:03.340
"An angel wears white kimono"

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:04.791
🤣

00:07:04.791 --> 00:07:05.540
Hoeee!?

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:07.360
"Ra"

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:08.294
"Raruku"

00:07:08.294 --> 00:07:09.162
"E"

00:07:09.162 --> 00:07:10.140
"Hermes"!

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:11.510
"E"

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:12.190
"Ru"

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:12.880
"Mes"

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:13.930
"...that an angel wears"

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:14.734
Eh?

00:07:14.734 --> 00:07:16.869
I could have sworn that I got it

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:18.180
"Hint"!

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:19.950
"Fashion center"

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:21.130
Shimamura?

00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:22.650
"Shima..."

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:23.780
"...Mu..."
(Shimamura = Clothing commercial chain)

00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:24.580
"Ra" Ah!
(Shimamura = Clothing commercial chain)

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:26.646
I see!

00:07:26.813 --> 00:07:27.246
Oohhh!

00:07:27.246 --> 00:07:28.281
It's a...

00:07:28.281 --> 00:07:29.115
...Very old...

00:07:29.549 --> 00:07:30.750
Is it the father??

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:32.151
The father that appeared at the start

00:07:32.151 --> 00:07:33.186
In the end...

00:07:33.186 --> 00:07:35.054
...Ended this way due to sadness

00:07:35.755 --> 00:07:36.670
Man!

00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:37.123
Well...

00:07:37.123 --> 00:07:38.724
...My percentage of success...

00:07:38.724 --> 00:07:39.759
...Is rather questionable, right?

00:07:39.759 --> 00:07:40.927
Well, but, but, but...

00:07:40.927 --> 00:07:43.830
...If I had to say, it was pretty high, right?

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:44.497
It's to be expected...!!

00:07:44.497 --> 00:07:45.631
...Of a super A.I!!

00:07:45.631 --> 00:07:47.700
I showed great intelligence, right?

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:48.740
Starting from now, I’ll keep...

00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:51.037
...Demonstrating my super A.I side
