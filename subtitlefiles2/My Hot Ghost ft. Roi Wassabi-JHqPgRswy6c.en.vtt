00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:09.860
I'm tired, can we just pick it up tomorrow?

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:10.940
I don't wanna go home yet.

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:12.420
Why??

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:14.300
I think my house is haunted.

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:15.280
Cool!

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:16.360
What do you mean?

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:18.080
I'm terrified of ghosts!

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:19.600
I used to be scared of ghosts too,

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:21.620
but then I figured out how to get over it.

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:22.800
How?

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.660
Look. Everyone imagines ghosts as scary-looking right?

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:29.420
But, what if you imagine them as like super hot?

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:31.520
That's weird.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.900
It's not weird when all my ghosts are Casper-looking hunks.

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:38.240
Okay, that does sound weird.

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:42.260
Trust me. Tonight, if you start getting scared and start picturing a scary ghost,

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:44.220
just imagine they're hot.

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:05.120
What the f...

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:05.780
NOOOOO

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:07.060
NOOOOOOOOOO

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:17.680
YOU'RE HOT!

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:28.160
Oh.

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.580
Hi!

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:31.200
Holy crap, it worked.

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:32.520
What worked?

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:35.960
I'm usually afraid of ghosts

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:38.460
but, never mind.

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.880
Hi there!

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.500
Wow! No one has never said Hi to me before.

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.000
They would just run away, screaming

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.800
and I'm just trying to get their attention.

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.500
Oh! That's terrible!

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.500
Yeah. I've just been dead for so long... and I'm just...

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.000
so lonely.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
That's awful.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Come over here.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
You make me feel alive like.... literally

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.000
What's your name?

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Beth.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Beth

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
I noticed you Beth

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
and you are beautiful.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
You are the sweetest guy. I mean

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
usually I feel like people see me like this.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Wow! Wow! Wow! That's nice! Beth! That's nice. OK Go back, please.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
OK, alright. You see, that's real beauty. Let's stick with that.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Whew.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
I have never met a guy like you.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
And I have never met a ghost - I mean

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.000
girl like you before.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
I feel like this is love at first sight.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
Yeah? Yeah. Don't you?

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Mmmm. I mean, even though we have just met

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
I feel like we are perfect.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Me? We still have a lot to learn about each other.

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.000
You could come to my side.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
That's entirely impossible!

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
You could meet my parents. They are a little cold at times

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
because they are dead but they are gonna love you!

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Or, we could just take it slow.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
I have a place, there is only one bedroom

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
but I see how they're actually living hell.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.000
Oh! Let's move in together and

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:26.000
we can get a puppy and name it our names combined

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
What was your name again? Don't worry about it

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
we have all of eternity to figure it out

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
OOOOh, Let's get married!

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.000
AAAAAGGGHHHHRRRRRR!

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
Hope you guys liked the video, we had a lot of fun making that one

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000
I was actually inspired by true events, not that actually met a hot ghost

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
I'm actually afraid of ghost

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
Someone actually did tell me to try this out

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
and it didn't work, still - afraid of ghost

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
Not that. It's totally fine.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.000
Anyways we've got a lot of videos coming out for this channel very soon

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
and it has been a while since we released something here

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.500
but actually we are releasing twice a week on our second channel with 2 new shows there.

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:26.000
And it has been a lot of fun as the fans are really liking.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.000

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000
We are going to several spots in the US and Canada

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
and then we're actually going to go to Hawai for the very first time

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000
And then we are going to go to Asia to finish off our tour.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
And also we released an app like about a month ago

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000
and there is a lot of people on there having a lot of fun, there is a one full community of fans

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:58.000
