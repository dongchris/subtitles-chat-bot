00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:05.200
How come no one invited Phil?

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:06.040
It's your party

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:09.680
Hey Wes, Ted. I'm gunna head out but

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:13.360
Thank you so much for hosting. I've never been to a Martin Luther King Jr. day party before

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:14.000
yeah

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.100
It's always been a dream of mine to throw one

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:16.480
you good to drive?

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.240
Ah, actually Chris is going to take me home

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:19.200
(scoffs) then laughs

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:20.160
Okay

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:21.360
What's so funny?

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:24.220
Doesn't Chris live like an hour in the opposite direction?

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:25.240
Yeah, he said it was no trouble

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.480
He like's you. Okay, we called the day you guys met.

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.840
Nooo, we're just friends. He even said so himself

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:34.940
A friend wouldn't offer to drive an hour out of his way just to take you home.

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.920
Well maybe in your insensitive driven world, but believe it or not guys and girls can be just friends

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.980
Look, Megan. I hate to blow the secret for all the guys out there

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:48.500
But, a guy that want's to be friends and a guy that want's to be more than friends, they act differently

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:49.360
Like how?

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:50.600
(Is she for realz rn)

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.020
(Slowly) Friends

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:52.940
(beep beep)

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:54.460
UUUH, it's still not responding

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.280

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:58.460
More than friends

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.240
Yeah, I'm checking the forms right now, and if you want I can pick it up for you tomorrow

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.680

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.460

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:24.360

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.500

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:27.940

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:29.480

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:51.660
(Harp strum)

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.080
I think I left my bobby pin at home

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:55.180
