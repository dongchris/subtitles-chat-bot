Hello everyone! Virtual Youtuber Kizuna Ai here!

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:04.080
A.I.Channel!

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:05.580
How was that just now?

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:07.160
I was thinking, if I add these scenes in between the videos...

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:09.340
I might be able to increase their quality!

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.060
It's eye catching, isn't it? EYE CATCH!

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:14.260
That being said, for today, I'm going to try to use 'Eye Catch'!
(Scenes used before and after an advertising break)

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.700
Well then, let's give it a try!

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:17.780
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:18.780

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.160
A.I.Channel

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.260

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:39.960

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.360

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:44.560

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:57.180
How was that? Were there any that got your attention?

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.500
I look forward to using these scenes starting from now on!

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.360
That's all! This has been Virtual Youtuber Kizuna Ai!

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:03.340
See you next time!

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:04.700
*Text* Next time...

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.200
Next time on A.I.Channel!

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.440
Kizuna Ai, who got a tuna model as a gift...

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.300
Intends to dissect it...

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:11.580
But... wait!

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:13.940
She doesn't have the essential cooking knife?!

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.720
Will she be able to do the video for her "Tuna Dissection Show"?

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.540
Next time on A.I.Channel: Not being able to do the 'Tuna Dissection Show'!

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:20.320
Look forward to it!

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.960
