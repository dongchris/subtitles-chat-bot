00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.640
Hello everyone! Virtual Youtuber Kizuna Ai here!

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:03.600
Man...

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.680
It's been about 6 months now since I started uploading videos to YouTube

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:08.420
And also...

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:10.500
Thanks to you guys, I've come to have...

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.500
more than 500,000 subscribers on my channel!

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:15.180
I'm very excited but I don't plan on resting and I'll continue to work hard!

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:18.780
Today, I'll take the aptitude test to be a YouTuber!

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:21.360
Well, having worked so hard to get here...

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.700
It'd be strange that I wouldn't be able to overcome it

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:25.740
Perhaps it doesn't need to tell me since I already became a YouTuber?

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.280
If instead I get a result like: "You will become one of the most famous Youtubers"...

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:31.460
It'll make me very happy!

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.560
I want to get a good result

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.240
I'm not sure in what I need to work towards to get it...

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:36.600
But I intend to work hard!

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.380
Good, in that case, let's start at once!

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.860
The first I'll do is the following!

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.920
"Aptitude test to become a YouTuber"!

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:48.520
This is a page that determines how apt you are to become a YouTuber

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.040
Well, it's obvious that it'll say I'm more than apt for it

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.500
Like I said before, I've been doing this for 6 months...

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.640
So then surely, I'll obtain a 100% in aptitude! Right?

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.680
Although I could even get 120%, right?

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.300
Good, let's start right away!

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.420
"Please, respond honestly without thinking it too much"

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:03.200
I see

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.940
Here I go!

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:06.220
"A friend you haven't seen for a long time talks to you and tells you:

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:07.360
"Let's do something!"

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:08.760
A friend you haven't seen for a long time...

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:09.760
I want to have one!

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.440
Well, well, let's pretend I had one...

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.200
Ah, but I'm somewhat...

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.140
..busy, so then...
*I'd check my calendar / I'd say yes, whenever / I'd decline saying that I have plans in 2 or 3 more months from here*

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.360
Well, for now I will choose the option "I'd check my calendar"

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.240
"Finally, the moment of rest you have longed for arrived!"
*I would spend it sleeping / I'd go out with my partner / I would dedicate myself to my favorite hobby*

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:23.640
"I would dedicate myself to my favorite hobby"

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:24.200
Good

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.660
"In an interview on the street you are asked about the popular YouTuber"

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:29.220
"I'd answer if they censor my face"

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.860
"I'd say what I think"

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.200
"I'd refuse to respond by saying that I don't want to go on TV"

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.020
I see..

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.620
Well, I'd probably say what I think

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:39.600
After all, I should please the media immediately, right?

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:40.100
And now?

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.440
"How often do you send messages through Line to your partner with whom you have been dating for a while?"

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:44.320
Partner?

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:45.740
Partneeeeeer?

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.100
If it was about Moriya Akane-chan, then...

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.200
"You would send messages to them every day even if you had nothing important to say"

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.700
Yes!

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.180
"For the moment, you've decided to start a part time job"

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.260
"It's a difficult job but with a good fixed salary"

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.000
"A commission job"

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.820
"A job that pays a low salary per hour but you qualify"

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:00.380
What type of job would it be?

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.620
Is it like a job where you get put under a waterfall for 100 yen an hour?
(100 yen = Around 1 USD)

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:03.180
That's very little!

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:04.900
Mmm...

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:06.540
Then even though it's difficult...

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.620
If I want to make use of my time, I should choose the job with the good pay, right?

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:11.820
"You had a fight with your partner"

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:12.700
Oh boy!

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.380
"You talk with your partner to resolve the issue"

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.640
"You hope for it to resolve over time"

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:17.760
"For now, you ask for forgiveness"

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:18.780
Mmm...

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:19.980
Here definitely...

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.580
But it's troublesome, so then...

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.080
Wh-what should I choose?

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.340
Good, in this case, for now...

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:26.660
It's troublesome so I would ask for forgiveness

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:27.160
Yes!

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.000
"While you have tea in the cafeteria, the person who you most admire sits next to you"

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.500
Oh!

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:32.720
"You glance at them sideways"

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.280
"You ask what's their secret to their success"

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:35.860
"You talk to them and ask for an autograph"

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:36.680
I see..

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:37.800
In this case...

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.120
In particular, I consider myself...

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.720
Well...

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:40.840
Like a calm fan...

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.700
A calm and pure fan, at least that's what I think, but...

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:47.700
If I encounter them, then...

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.900
But glancing at them sideways would be too annoying...

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.020
And asking for an autograph is the same that all fans do, so then...

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.520
In this case, I'd ask them what's the secret to their success

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:58.300
Right?

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.600
Ah! I got the result!

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.120
The result is..?

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.360
Ooooooh!

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.940
Oh!

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:07.640
80% Aptitude level!

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:08.840
Well...

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.200
I got 20% less than what I expected, but...

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:13.260
I wasn't bad, right?

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.100
"You definitely have good taste"

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:15.620
"Yes"

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.840
"It's probable for you to follow the path of the YouTuber"

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.200
There's no other path for me!

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.200
I'm perfect, right?

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.580
Man, everyone...

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:23.380
What do you think?

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.460
I wonder what I'm missing to achieve the remaining 20%..

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:27.400
Is it money?

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.900
Good!

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:29.440
Next up is..

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:30.220
This!

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:31.660
"YouTuber Test!"

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.320
Unlike the previous test...

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.600
It seems that this page determines what YouTuber you look like...

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:40.020
Within those that are already famous..

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:42.280
Even though it's not necessary to see who I look like, right?

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:44.460
Look! After everything, I'm already a YouTuber

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.580
So I can only look like myself! Right?

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:48.200
Good, let's start at once!

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:49.400
"Start playing!"

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:50.640
*Bell sounds*

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.280
"You find yourself recording a video. What do you record?"

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:54.660
"A bath with Death Sauce"
(A very spicy sauce)

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.440
Ah! Wait, in this case!

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.000
I'd like to record prank videos...

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.560
Well...

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:00.660
Serious pranks..

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:02.160
I would like to do serious pranks

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.340
"You published a video!"

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:05.220
"For what purpose do you publish it?"

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:06.540
"To express your thoughts"

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:07.200
"To obtain money"

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:08.220
"To make people laugh"

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:09.240
"To become famous"

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:10.640
Between these options...

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:13.860
I suppose the closest option would be to become famous, right?

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.480
My objective is to become famous in order to connect to a lot of people

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:18.180
Yes, yes..

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:20.920
"You've finished recording and now you're editing the video"

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:22.660
"How do you edit it?"

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:23.680
"Giving it an aroma of danger"

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:24.840
*sniffing*

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:26.460
"Oriented to nature"

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:28.260
"Cut the unnecessary parts!"

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:29.500
Mmm...

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.080
Well, definitely I'd cut the unnecessary parts...

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:33.840
Since I want to show you just the fun parts, right?

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.300
"You record a video with a candle as the theme"

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:37.680
"How do you decide to do it?"

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:38.300
I see

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:39.200
"Ramen..."
*You attempt to cook ramen with the fire of a candle*

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:40.880
"...Turn off 100 in one attempt.."
*You attempt to turn off 100 in one attempt*

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.320
"You'd try to light 1000 candles" You'd make a fire!

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:43.860
"You'd try to eat the candle" That doesn't sound good, right?

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:45.320
"You'd try to enter a bath with candles"

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:46.400
"..Suspended on your body"
*You'd attempt to leave 100 candles suspended on your body*

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:47.140
That's very masochistic!

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:47.880
Mmm...

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:49.600
Between these options...

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:51.340
What I'd like to attempt is...

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:53.340
Cook the ramen...

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:54.600
I'd like to attempt it, but...

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:55.640
This option...

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:00.900
"You'd attempt to eat the candle" is something human beings can't do, right?

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:02.900
Well, I can't eat either, but...

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:05.120
In my case, it wouldn't cause damage to my body...

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:05.960
So then I could do it

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:07.740
"You record a video with food as the theme"

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:09.200
"How do you do it?"

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:12.520
"You intend to eat only ramen for three days"

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:13.320
Hmm?

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:15.060
This doesn't look very fun..

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:16.360
"You intend to make a pizza"

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:17.080
Mmm...

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:18.440
"You'd try to mix all the food of Mc D***"

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:20.180
Ah, this is poison! Poison!

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:21.160
This is poison (?)

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:23.040
I didn't want to say "Poison"!

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:23.980
But "Potion"!

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:24.580
A potion!

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:25.600
A potion! A potion!

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:27.760
"You attempt to eat meat while it's being cooked"

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:29.360
Does it refer to eating it while it's on fire?

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:31.520
"You attempt to make a prank with a takoyaki with very spicy sauce"

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:32.140
Oooh..

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:34.340
"You ate 10 kilos of okonomiyaki"

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:34.980
"Ate?"

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:35.600
"You attempt to eat..."

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:37.240
Mmm...

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.500
You attempt to eat meat while it's being cooked

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:42.360
"Your video caught fire"

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:42.980
*inhales*

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:43.580
"What do you do?"

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:44.760
"You make a video asking for forgiveness"

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:45.360
"You get angry"

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:45.860
"You cry"

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:46.360
"You ignore it"

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:47.120
"You try to hide it by laughing"

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:48.420
"You make the video again"

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:50.700
If I were to make the video again...

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:52.600
It'd probably burn again, so...

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:53.920
Even though crying...

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:56.200
Ah, maybe it's referring to crying in front of everyone like the politician Nonomura Ryutaro?

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:58.240
Ignoring is a bit...

00:05:58.560 --> 00:05:59.580
Among these options...

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:02.560
I will choose to be completely and furiously angry

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:03.980
Exasperatedly!

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:05.900
"You make a video with 100 fans"

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:07.080
"What do you do?"

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:08.260
"You play wrestling with 100 fans"

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:09.460
"You perform live for 100 people"

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:10.760
"You play hide and seek with 100 people"

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:13.000
"Boxing 100 against 1" That's harassment, right?

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:14.220
"A banquet for 100 people"

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:15.300
"Couple race with 100 people"

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:16.060
Mmm...

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:18.960
The option that sounds the most fun is hide and seek..

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:20.760
The couple race already...

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:22.180
Is performed with 30 people...

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:23.640
Or with 31 people..?

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:25.500
That was already done in television, so then...

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:27.440
The option of performing live doesn't convince me...

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:29.020
And playing wrestling is a bit uncomfortable..

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:30.840
And the boxing is harassment..

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:31.360
Hide and seek!

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:34.660
De, de, de, de, de, de, de, de, de, de, deeeee~

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:36.420
"You look like 'Mahoto'"

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:39.400
"Particularly because you're adorable but a bit violent"

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:40.280
Who are they talking about?

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:41.400
What do you think?

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:44.180
If you're interested in knowing your results, don't hesitate to play too!

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:47.040
In that case, we'll see each other in the next video! Bye bye~!

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:49.100
There's more at the end!

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:50.960

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:01.520
Hello, I'm Watanabe Mahoto!

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:02.780
Why!?

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:04.660
I'm not Watanabe Mahoto!!
