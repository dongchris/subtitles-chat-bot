00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:03.420
Hello! Virtual Gamer, Kizuna Ai here!

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:07.180
Welcome, everybody, to my game-room!

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:09.440
Isn't it great? Isn't it fantastic!

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:10.700
Today I'll be,

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:14.320
challenging Cryptract in this room!

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:17.340
Look at my beloved Kiru-chan

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:19.480
They're all pretty cute right?

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:21.820
I've assigned all my favourite characters

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.140
As expected, when you're playing Cryptract

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:26.920
for your favorite character in Cryptract,

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:27.600
you know,

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:28.600
you have to assign them.

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:29.640
Or else you just can't,

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:30.480
get pumped up!

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:32.760
Let's start a quest right away!

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:38.820
I can do this, ah, that penguin is cute

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.160
Wait, what do you call that?

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:42.140
So cute

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:44.160
Oh, oh, how was that?

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.500
OH, one-shot!

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:46.840
Lookin' good, lookin' good!

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:51.980
Go! My ‘mai-waifus’!

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:54.180
Go, go, go!

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.100
OHOHOH

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:58.880
That was nice, that was nice.

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.480
Keeping using your skills!

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:02.640
Ah, but,

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:04.220
the boss is kinda strong

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.700
Her legs are long!

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.040
Ah doesn't this look bad...?

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:13.760
Bad...?

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.020
Ah, but but,

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:16.800
with just a bit more I'll be able to beat one of them.

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:18.020
NOー!

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:19.100
That single hit is strong!

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:21.880
You can do it!

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:23.480
Oh! Oh, for the time being,

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:24.600
I'll take one,

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:26.620
take the minion down.

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.920
OH NO !!

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:28.460
Ah but!

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:29.300
This girl

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:31.200
She is quite...

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.440
You can see the four pop out, the number

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:36.080
that means I can still take four,

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:37.000
four more—

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:38.940
Turns of atta-ta-ta-ta—

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.860
turns of attack, so.

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:40.360
I can do this!

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:44.100
Oh!

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:47.940
I can do this, can't I! Only this boss left!

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:49.260
AHHHHHHhhhhhh!

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:50.340
AH ah!

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:51.540
AH! AH!

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:52.180
Eh?

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.060
Ah! My...

00:01:55.775 --> 00:01:56.775
My...

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:58.160
AHHH!

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:01.860
This is bad, isn't it...

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:03.260
YA! Keep going keep going!

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:03.860
You can do this!

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:04.640
*cute warcry*

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.720
Is this bad?

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.560
This is pretty bad, isn’t it

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:12.280
NO!!

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:13.960
Ah! There’s still… Ah I can keep going

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.160
Eh! What's this girl's name I wonder?

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:21.660
Friend? Friend...?

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:22.600
The allied team’s girl.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.880
Her attack animations are amazingly cute

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.520
Saying that, this is bad...

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.960
It's not the time to say ‘cute’… Not good...

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:35.780
O oh oh o Oh o!

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.200
Oh Oh oH Oh Oh!

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:38.160
OH!

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:39.460
AH!

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.540
NO!! Not Good!

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:45.180
Do it!

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.260
This is a life-and-death problem.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:50.080
This is bad.

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:51.080
Ah...

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:53.920
Here nex—AH, EH no way

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:56.820

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:57.320
Ah

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:00.100
AH!

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:02.580
AHHHH!

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:04.440
AH!

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:06.500
Go for it, go for it!

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:08.440
NO!

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:09.360
PLEASE STOP!

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:14.900
Do you not think so?

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:16.640
Did you guys not think so?

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.120
My unit is...

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.220
Automatically...

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.040
healing itself.

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.920
Like that!

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.440
This is a piece of cake!

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:29.480
Please try me.

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:30.420
It's four against one

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:32.180
Ah, ah see!

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:33.620
It's four against one

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:34.700
Everyone also has,

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.800
quite some HP—

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.980
See?

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:38.400
Just a little bit more!

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:40.960
As I expected...

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:42.180
My chosen,

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:43.320
girls...

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.940
YOSH~!

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:45.980
WIN!

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:48.940
Ah, as expected!

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:50.540
As expected of me!

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:53.580
My rank, went up!

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:56.460
Ah! *Surprised*

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:57.840
*Surprised*

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:00.000
A rare quest has appeared!

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.540
It seems I have no choice, but to challenge it!

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:06.380
Go!

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:07.640
Do it now!

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:09.020
Oh wai—AHH, wait!

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.940
Okay, good.

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:13.300
Good good.

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:15.860
Good!

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:18.120
Oh? Yes!

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.260
We're finally here.

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:22.460
The boss.

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.200
Ah, come on, it looks strong!

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:29.120
OHHH.

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:31.260
That one shot already made her lose half her HP...

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:33.140
Lose...

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:34.940
LOST ITTTT

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:35.440
Ag...

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:39.280
AHhh

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:42.060
Hah...

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:44.500
*cute mumble*

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:46.920
Go on!

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:47.820
You guys,

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:49.340
do your best!

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:50.600
Oh you there!

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:51.500
That was good just now!

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:52.900
That attack just now!

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:54.360
Let's try the next one!

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:56.280
Ahh that was nice, you!

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:57.780
This is good, this pace.

00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:58.780
That's good.

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:01.100
Ah the enemies are also,

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:01.680
like, faltering now, good job.

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:02.180
You guys

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:04.180
Doing good, as expected.

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:06.760
As expected.

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:08.200
O~ wasn't that going quite well... You…

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:09.780
Where did you learn that from?

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:10.700
Nice

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:14.120
Nice~ as expected of our...

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:14.660
Hm?

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:16.420
As expected of my waifus, you know

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:18.560
Hey you gals, nice going~

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:20.660
It’s like that after all, you know?

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:22.460
We can’t go without, like,

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:23.740
an overseeing figure

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:25.400
together with us

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:27.960
Σ（ﾟдﾟlll）

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:30.480
Stop... Two more and...

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:32.460
Go~ for it

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:35.200
Go for it~

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:37.380
Go for it!

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:38.360
GO

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:38.920
FOR

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:39.720
IIIIT~

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:41.440
Everyone's trying their hardest, right? I get it

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:43.260
Everyone's trying hard, you're all trying hard enough

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:49.140
Is it that?

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:51.080
My sexiness

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:52.500
Is it not enough?

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:54.100
I get it

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:54.680
Yeah

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:55.300
As I thought

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:58.700
It’s because sexiness is, like, you girls’, like,

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:00.720
source of power, after all.

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:03.220
*sexy*

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:06.920
35…

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:10.680
Hello~

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:12.320
An efficient way to work

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:14.500
A fulfilling life...

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:16.220
I’m a Youtuber!

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:19.860
EH?!

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:24.080
Because I was talking about sexiness?!

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:25.060
WAIT~!

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:29.060
No!

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:30.560
When did it?

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:34.760
And it looks like it'll end with no one left

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:36.180
Nope

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:38.320
Wait a little bit, you all...

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:39.160
Wait a li'l

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:40.080
WAIT A LI'L!

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:45.000
Damn it.

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:46.400
If only I had...

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:50.580
If only I had more sexiness...

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:51.720
･ﾟ･(ﾉД`;)･ﾟ･

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:52.980
And with that...

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:54.080
How was it?

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:55.600
Well...

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:57.280
That was pretty sucky wasn't it...

00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:58.500
I was...

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:01.680
Well, since my sexiness was not enough,

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:03.380
I'll work on my sexiness!

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:05.180
I'll work on my unit!

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:06.620
Next time for sure!

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:08.580
Around five.

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:09.940
Around difficulty five.

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:11.180
I’ll say "It's a piece of cake!"

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:12.220
I'll challenge it!

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:15.080
And so, that was Virtual Gamer Kizuna Ai!

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:16.180
Please come again!
