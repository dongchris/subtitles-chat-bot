00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.700
Hi there! Virtual gamer, Kizuna Ai here.

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:06.240
I'm always searching for games to kill time,

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:12.220
and so while searching, I found this super super cute,  unbelievably cute game!

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:12.940
Tada!

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:14.540
Lucky's Tale!

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:16.540
It's so cute.

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:20.200
Anyway, it's cute - everyone, look, touch!.. You can't touch it?

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.980
You can't touch it, but look at how it feels to touch it.

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.180
Well then, let's go!

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.040
Let's get started!

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.040
This pig is cute!

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:29.360
Pony-chan!

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:31.100
Ah, I need to enter my name.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:33.780
Pony and...

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.340
Mister Kon.

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.240
Story mode is here?

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:42.860
Ah, this?

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.520
They're so cute!

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.460
"Lucky and Piggy" they're called, apparently.

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.440
But to me, they are Pony and Mr. Kon.

00:00:58.940 --> 00:00:59.840
So cute!

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.160
Pony is super cute!

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.460
Amazing!

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:06.500
Pony is cute!

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.460
Ah, there's a mouse!

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.640
What? A tentacle? An octopos?

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:18.540
No! Pony!

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:20.640
No, no, no.

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:24.020
Oi!

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:25.800
I can't hit it.

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.900
Ah no, poor thing.

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.700
This is difficult, not being able to do anything.

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.380
Pony...

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:43.980
He was kidnapped!

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:46.620
That octopus kidnapped Pony.

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:49.720
We should go searching.

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:50.680
Ah, hello.

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.020
Oh, he's cute.

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.080
So cute!

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.160
I want to touch Pony too!

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:57.120
Cute!

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:59.940
So cute.

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:00.820
I'm so close!

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:02.540
Now what?

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:04.260
Ah, jump...

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:05.980
Oh, I can double jump.

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.220
Ah, awesome!

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:10.980
I see, I see

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:11.860
Then here..

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.600
Ah, I can hit with my tail.

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:15.300
I see.

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.260
So, I collect coins...

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.060
For now, we have to go this way.

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.720
Now here,

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:22.220
Oh!

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:23.260
OH!!

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.560
Ah! A diamond! A big diamond!

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.260
What's this? Can I take these guys?

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:30.360
I can't.

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.940
Then,

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.400
Then double jump!

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:42.960
I'm fine for coins.

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.080
Ah, this looks heavy, don't you think?

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.160
Can I beat this guy with it?

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.560
Oh!

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.560
 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.680
Like this?

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.440
Ah, I did it!

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.100
I need to look for Pony.

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:00.480
I want to save him.

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:01.560
What's this?

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.800
I went in.

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.720
Oh, amazing.

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.680
Hit them with your tail.

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:21.860
Ah, amazing!

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:23.340
Ah, a diamond.

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:24.340
Then,

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:25.700
I go here and...

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.380
Ah, I see.

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.400
He's amazing, this guy. and cute.

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:31.420
Ah, no.

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:34.900
Ah, I liked that.

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:37.720
I really am a genius, aren't I.

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:42.000
Ah!

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:43.820
「ＣＯＭＥ ＯＮ」

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:44.420
Go!

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:45.580
Let's go.

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.020
Ah! I fell.

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.060
So I can grab onto the obstacles.

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:59.360
Where should I go?

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:00.220
Ah, good, good.

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:08.080
Ah, he looks like the octopus.

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:12.320
Ah, that's dangerous.

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:14.840
Where to?

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:16.740
Ah, I see!

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:22.220
These bug guys are my enemies but they're cute, too.

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:23.820
No, no, no!

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.340
Don't follow me.

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.200
Everything looks like it's gotten smaller!

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:32.760
Ah, so cute!

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:35.940
I wonder if I can touch this.

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.160
I can touch it.

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:47.900
Ok.

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.840
Ti.

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:49.860
Ny.

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:51.880
So cute.

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.560
"Hue hue hue", he says.

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.480
Cute.

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:57.780
Can I pick these up?

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:58.900
Ah! I blew them away!

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:00.060
Awesome!

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:05.660
I'm not going to lose to these bugs.

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:07.560
Ah! good, good.

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:08.520
Then?

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:09.820
Checkpoint?

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:11.680
Ah, I see, I see.

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:15.460
Go, go!

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:18.860
I wonder if these are all the diamonds...

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:23.020
For now, let's get out of this dangerous place.

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:25.940
I fell.

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:29.720
Huh?

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:31.560
Ah!

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:32.460
I'm sorry...

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:35.020
I'm so-o-rry...

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:37.320
I can't fall, can I?

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.160
Need to be careful.

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:44.140
Ah, I see, I see.

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:48.620
Feeling good, here's a checkpoint.

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:50.400
Where to now?

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:53.120
This seemed like it was open.

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:55.800
This way for now, I guess.

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.240
Hm?

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:03.620
A bomb.

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:06.300
I grab this...

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:07.380
Hm?

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:13.520
Ah!

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:17.380
Then...

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:20.440
Ah, this is hard.

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:22.700
Woah, woah.

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:25.580
Like this?

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:27.140
Then?

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:28.480
Ah, danger!

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:34.180
I'm not going fall? I'm ok?

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:38.200
Another?

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:40.620
Ah, then a diamond appears.

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:43.500
Ah, I warped!

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:45.120
I see.

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:46.880
Some flying thing is there.

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:47.700
Scary.

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:50.660
This is dangerous.

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:53.720
He's dangerous.

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:03.220
Like this?

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:04.400
Huh?

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:05.580
Ok.

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:08.860
I like this.

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:12.600
I'm not getting them all, but it's good.

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:14.280
Then?

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:16.400
I can't fall. Hm?

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:18.760
Hm?

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:25.700
Over here.

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:36.220
I can't fall but it's hard...

00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:39.140
From here?!

00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:43.340
This is to save Pony!

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
That's the first time that's happened!

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.280
Even though they were so nice until now.

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:04.840
Wait. Wait.

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:09.660
No.

00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:11.000
Move!

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.120
Get out of the way!

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:13.820
Ah, this is good.

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:19.160
Then go this way,

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:21.680
Oh? Ah, I can go this way.

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:22.440
This way.

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:23.940
I didn't have to go up.

00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:27.300
Then,

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:29.520
Wait, wait!

00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:32.060
That was definitely the end!

00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:33.620
Right? That was the end.

00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:40.060
So I should climb up here?

00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:44.080
Oops.

00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:48.920
Ah, wait, wait!

00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:50.240
Ah, we're ok.

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:53.800
Ah, I got there.

00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:58.340
I wonder how much getting more points changes that.

00:08:58.340 --> 00:08:59.560
Bye bye!

00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:00.420
How was that?

00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:03.600
I still haven't saved Pony,

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.040
but Mr. Kon is cute.

00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:09.720
and the way he moves, don't you think?

00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:13.440
Anyway, I think I'll try and save Pony on my days off.

00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:17.660
That's all. This was Virtual Gamer, Kizuna Ai. See you next time!
