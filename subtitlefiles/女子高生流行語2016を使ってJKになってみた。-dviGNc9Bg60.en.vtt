00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.640
Hi!

00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:05.180
Virtual Youtuber and JK (high school girl) A.I., Kizuna AI!

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:11.560
Today, I'll be going over some words from the "Top high school girls' slang" contest of 2016!

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:16.540
Words like "jiwaru" and "sorena" seem to have been popular in the past!

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:22.480
If you're wondering how girls tend to use these words...

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:23.500
Good morning, Jessica!

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.740
I learned a very interesting joke recently.

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:27.600
Look look!

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:29.360
Gets!

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:30.660
Eh...what's that?

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:32.920
Yaba, jiwaru (Wow, it gets funnier the more I think about it).

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.680
Yukki, what about you?

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.480
No yeah, I get you.

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.880
You feel that way too?

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.260
So they're used kind of like that!

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:44.420
By the way, Yukki and Jessica are my imaginary high school girls.

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:45.000
Huh?

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.340
I'm not lonely at all.

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:47.180
Not at all...

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.160
So what I'll be doing is picking two words from this list,

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.740
combine them appropriately

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:56.460
and show you all how high school girls talk!

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.440
Because I want to be a high school girl.

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.120
And thus, by mastering the colloquialisms used by these girls...

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.320
I too can become a high school girl...

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:06.580
Anyway, here's the first combination!

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.520
From ninth place, we have "sunoru" and from sixth place, "ma"!

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.600
So, I'll try using these two phrases and talk like a high school girl.

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:19.360
Hey let's SNOW together! (SNOW is a face recognition camera applicat ion)

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:20.760
Say cheese!

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.260
Ah...thatâ€™s iffy.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:24.780
Maybe the rabbit one?

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.720
Say cheese!

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.120
This is a bit ugly, don't you think?

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:30.000
Ma?

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:30.960
Ma?

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.520
Ma?

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.280
Seriously ugly.

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.560
I didn't even realize SNOW could turn out this terrible. Holy crap.

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.640
Like this. How was it?

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.320
Okay, well next we have...

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.280
From second place, we have "yoki" and from third, "~maru"!

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.520
"yoki" and "~maru",

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:53.660
by using these two,

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.060
I will get into a high school girl.

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.880
Hey, Yukki. Seriously that guy is very yoki (cool), isn't he?

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.780
Yukki, is he your type perfectly?

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:03.100
Eh? Yoki, yoki, yoki, yoki, yoki.

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:04.500
You're not going to find a guy like him every day!

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.180
Try asking for his LINE ID!

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.940
But...but...I'm not very confident in that kind of thing...

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.300
What? That's really annoying.

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.880
You like that type, right?

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.040
Hurry up and go!

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.100
Yes...OK maru.

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.980
U-Um... If you don't mind, would you like to share LINE IDs?

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
And Furufuru...

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.360
Oh, really!? Thank you very much.

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.800
Ah yes. I will contact you later.

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:43.340
Thank you very much.

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:44.920
Aza maru (= Thank you very much).

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:46.380
Ai-chan, Ai-chan!

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.980
It was OK maru! OK maru!

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:51.900
Yeah, so something like that.

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:57.460
Okay, so last but not least, "amore" from fourth place and "BFF" from seventh place!

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.760
Well, how appropriate for being the last set.

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.620
"Amore" and "BFF".

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.020
I'll try imitating a typical high school girl's conversation with these words!

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:08.620
Ai, Ai.

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:13.380
I hear that Yukki is dating that guy she shared LINE IDs with.

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:15.480
I found her Instagram the other day.

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.060
She had a picture of her and that guy uploaded with "amore" written on the image.

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.940
No way! That's amazing.

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.100
"Amore"... What are they? Italian?

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.240
The only amore for me is you, Jessica.

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:30.300
Yeah, I get you.

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:34.380
Seriously though, boyfriends are so much more annoying than girl friends.

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.940
I love you, too. Ai is the only one I love.

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.160
We are BFF, right? (BFF = Best Friend Forever)

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:41.600
BFF!

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.980
Probably something like that.

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:46.960
This is correct, right?

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.180
I mean, there's no way I'd be wrong, right? Since I'm a high school girl and all.

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:51.340
I am a Japanese high school girl.

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:52.760
Real high school students,

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:58.260
if you think "What? Seriously? You literally cannot be more wrong about those words."

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:02.020
please tell me the correct use-case.

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:07.020
I want to keeping up with the recent youth, but it is a bit difficult.

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.140
Well, that's it from the self-proclaimed high school girl youtuber, Kizuna Ai!

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.700
I'll become a real high school girl.
