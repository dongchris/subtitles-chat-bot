Hello everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna AI here!

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:05.340
Everyone, do you know Jinrou?
(Jinro = Werewolf)

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:10.380
It’s a popular party game that also appeared on TV...

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.920
...In which everyone joins and play enthusiastically

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.620
At seeing videos of the game, it seemed very fun, so then...

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:17.180
I also want to try to play it...!!

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:19.060
I thought that, but...

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:20.400
An analogical game...??

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.160
In which everyone joins in to play??

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:23.000
I...!

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.060
Can’ t play it!

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:25.760
I don't like that!

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.380
Really I don’t like it at all, at all!

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.720
I also want to play with everyone!!

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.320
Normally I tend to say these kinds of things, but...

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:34.420
Today, I’m...

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.060
...Rather different than the usual

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.980
After all, I’m an A.I with no equal

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:40.140
Having said that, today...

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.960
...I’ll be playing the game "Jinrou" on a web site

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.220
In that case, let's start to play at once!

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.940
It's my first time, but... I’ll do my best!

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:49.820
The game Jinrou is about...

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.620
...Well, it depends on the rules but probably in this village...

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.280
...There’s 2 werewolves...

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:55.700
...There’s a madman

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.480
...There’s a fortune teller and the rest are villagers

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.180
And we'll, basically...

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.280
...You need to reveal who are the werewolves...

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.480
...And lynch them

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.320
If you manage to hunt all the werewolves before...

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:09.440
...there are the same number of villagers and werewolves...

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:10.560
...The villagers will win

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:11.360
And also...

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:13.160
...If you lose... Eh?

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.320
Wait, wait a moment, ah... ah, ah, ah...
[ Bodyguard ]

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.220
Well, well, please observe!!

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.880
I’m a villager? Hunt...? Ah...

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:20.120
Bod...

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.780
Bodyguard

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:22.460
Since I’m the bodyguard...

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.380
...I should protect the fortune teller, right?

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:25.500
Ok!

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:26.920
It turns out that the fortune teller...

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:27.860
...Well...

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:33.280
...Each night, they can check to see if a suspicious person is a werewolf or not

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.600
It’s because of that, that the werewolf, well, to avoid...

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.480
...Being found out immediately, they should devour the fortune teller

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.440
So that’s why the Bodyguard...

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.320
...Should protect the fortune teller

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.200
[ A creepy night has ended ]

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:46.220

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:54.640
Very good!

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.340
And well, the maniac is a villager, but...

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:59.600
Oh, the fortune teller!

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:01.560
Let's see... what number was the fortune teller?

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:02.440
Ah, number 9

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.480
Number 9 is the fortune teller

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:06.920
The persons 9 and 7...

What does 270 mean?
(It’s the time remaining until voting starts)

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.040
6 innocent, 8 innocent

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.800
Numbers 6 and 8 are innocent...

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:20.320
Wait…

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.240
Well, the 6... the 4 that are found below...

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.540
...Are innocent, but...

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:26.300
But...

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.960
Well...

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.060
...As well as the maniac...

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:29.060
...Just like the werewolves...

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.660
Can be lying by saying: "I’m the fortune teller!" so then...

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.320
Eh? But really, I don’t want them to kill me

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.280
It's true, Gureran means...
[ KizunaAI: It’s gureran, right? ]

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.220
...That by being the first night...
[ Gureran = Grey Random

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.980
...No one honestly knows who can be a suspicious person
[ Gureran = Grey Random
Said by people who can’t make a decision to who should be hanged ]

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:44.680
It's because of that... well...

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:50.580
"For the moment, let’s judge the suspects by majority vote" it means something like that

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.160
Wait, I’m really bad at explaining

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.220
I’m very bad, right?

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:54.240
It's because of that...

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:55.140
...Well, for the moment...

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.780
...Since it's impossible for there to be two fortune tellers...

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.660
… 7 or 9, one of them is an impostor

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:02.500
Nevertheless...

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.200
...I still don’t know which of the two

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:07.540
Eh? Wait, wait...

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:10.240
It's true...

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:11.200
F-for the moment...

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:12.620
...I should talk...

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:15.700
...Or I might be assassinated by majority vote, so then...

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:16.400
...Well...

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:17.880
For the moment...

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:20.380
...I should make sure to say something

But I have nothing more to say!

"I want to hang number 5 first"

It's very hard, right?

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:30.640
I want to extend chat window

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:32.500
Can’t I extend it?

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.800
Yes?

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:58.800
I’m a beginner at this so then I’ll try to convince then with that

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.880
"I’m doing my best following the conversation and I can’t make a decision"

Right?

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.700
Well, I’ll turn into a target, so then...

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.840
...It’s very hard to act this way, right?

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:20.600
It's true, the fortune teller also...

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:22.580
How do I say it?

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:24.360

I’ll say what I think!

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:32.360
For the moment, I suppose I’ll choose number 5

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:33.740
But I’m still unsure

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:40.380
Eh? I suppose for the moment, I’ll choose number 5

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:42.160
I’ll choose number 5, Eh?

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.220
Then, who did the fortune teller say it’s innocent?

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:47.680
"Innocent"

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:48.760
Who was innocent?

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:50.900
Who was innocent?

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:53.640
Who said who was innoceeent!?

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:55.260
Ah, number 7...

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:56.420
...Said it was 6...

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:58.060
Number 7...

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:59.780
...Said that 6 was innocent, so then...

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:02.660
And also, number 8...

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:04.540
Eh? Number 9... Eh? Aaaahhh?

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:06.420

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:16.780
Eeeeh?

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:19.500
In that case, I suppose I’ll choose number 1, after all, they haven’t said anything

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:21.440
"I’m a sumura"

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:25.140
I suppose that it’s only thing that they can say...

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:30.040
Sumura are villagers that don't have any role, right?

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:30.540

That’s right, if you don’t say anything, they eliminate you that way

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:36.400
You’re eliminated

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:37.500
It's because of that...

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:39.680

So then a shaman is not needed?
(In some game modes, there’s the role "shaman" which is able to determine what role the person who was killed had, in this case everyone knows the role of the person who has died)
