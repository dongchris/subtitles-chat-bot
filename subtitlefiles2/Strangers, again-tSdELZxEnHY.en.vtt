00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:11.480
"We're just wasting time."

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:13.080
"And now you think I'm stupid."

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.800
"You know I don't think that Marissa."

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.680
"You don't say it, but I know you're thinking it."

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.180
"Well of course I'm thinking it right now,

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.680
this whole thing is stupid."

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:20.300
"See?"

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:22.960
"See what? It is!

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.620
Who cares if I wanna leave early?

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:26.820
Even you barely know her and you're getting mad at me?"

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.580
"Yea, cause you think I'm annoying you."

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:30.380
"Oh my god,

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:31.480
this isn't even about us,

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.340
this is about your coworker's lame potluck

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:34.840
that you feel obligated to go to

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.300
because she has no friends.

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:37.700
If we go, that counts.

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:39.300
We don't have to stay the whole four hours."

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.880
"But it is about us,

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.500
it's about you not understanding what's important to me."

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.340
"Eating homemade potato salad and playing the Scrabble

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.160
tournament is important to you?"

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:51.500
"This is stupid."

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.120
"That's what I just said!"

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.640
"You're stupid."

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.580
"You know what, I'm willing to let that one go.

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:00.660
Can you just tell me if we can leave early or not, please?"

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:03.960
"Josh, you tell me."

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.300
"Look, I'm sorry I brought it up.

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.060
Can you just decide, and I'll do whatever."

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:16.720
"No Josh, not this time.

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.280
I'm not gonna tell you what to do, because you're just

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.040
gonna use it against me later saying,

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.960
'I always do what you say.'

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.660
No more."

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:36.580
"Hey, this one wasn't my fault.

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:38.660
There's no reason for this."

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.760
"You're right, there is no reason for this."

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:52.260
"It wasn't always like this.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:56.820
I can't really remember when it wasn't, but

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:58.820
I know for sure we weren't always like this."

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.380
"She used to be

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:04.540
my unicorn."

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:08.200
"You know?

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:09.840
Unbelievable.

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.680
Crazy special,

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.180
the girl I thought could never exist."

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.400
"But, as time went on

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:19.920
from one stage of our relationship to the next,

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.940
the path that started off so innocent and fun

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:25.700
has taken us to...

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:27.360
that."

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:30.980
"But, like most,

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.700
we started off as strangers.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.420
That's stage one: Meeting.

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:37.760
Thanks to a shoelace, actually."

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.040
"Excuse me!"

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.420
"Excuse me, your shoelaces are untied."

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:47.440
"Oh, oh! Thanks!"

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:48.620
"No problem, wouldn't want you to–"

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.620
I couldn't have played it better even if I'd tried

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:56.280
But thank goodness the city hadn't fixed

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.060
their park trails in five years.

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:02.400
I didn't tell her that

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.940
it was my first time running in about nine months

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:07.580
And somehow, we ended up going

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:09.320
for almost five miles that day.

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.380
It's so pathetic to see how guys would do

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.900
just about anything, for the right girl.

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:19.240
But it paid off,

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:21.180
because I got her number.

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:26.300
We really hit it off that day,

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.880
I think so at least, I blacked out for a few minutes,

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:30.540
but when I woke up I remember feeling like

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:31.860
I had made a pretty good impression.

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.820
"From that point on, we entered stage two:

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:38.920
The Chase.

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.520
Some say it's the best part."

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.060
All I wanted was to know more about her.

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:52.020
All I wanted to do was hangout with her

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:52.860
"Ready?"

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:56.000
"Ughh..."

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.320
The only person I wanted to talk to was her.

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.380
She was the number one priority.

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:10.380
"What the hell, man?"

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:13.760
And everytime I saw her,

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:16.320
butterflies.

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.620
She was everything that I thought

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:23.060
could be perfect in a girl.

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:25.600
And as soon as it felt right,

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:26.700
"Would you be my girlfriend?"

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:29.080
"Yeah."

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.040
With this simple word,

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:32.540
we began our relationship,

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:35.240
taking us into stage three:

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:36.840
The Honeymoon.

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:41.420
Everyone calls it this, and for good reason.

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:43.720
It was the time when we could finally

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:45.800
fully express our affection to each other,

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.320
and do all the things we wanted to do as a couple.

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:51.100
It was a dream come true.

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:54.520
The girl I wanted to be with so, so badly

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:56.680
was finally mine.

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:03.800
But eventually, the fire cooled

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:06.260
and both of us simmered down back to normalcy.

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:11.340
By the end of it all,

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:14.060
we had a bajillion pictures with each other,

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.880
knew every detail of our daily lives,

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.360
and like any normal, healthy couple,

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:22.760
we entered stage four:

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:24.780
Comfortable.

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:26.700
"What do you wanna do tonight?"

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:30.460
"I don't know, whatever."

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.500
Now, being comfortable isn't necessarily bad,

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.480
it's when we could truly be ourselves.

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:39.260
But it depends on what you do with that comfort.

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:41.300
Some use it positively,

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:43.480
continuing to work at their relationship, and

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:45.020
grow together.

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:48.400
But, others allow it to create distance.

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:51.180
And for Marissa and I,

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.040
it made us take each other for granted.

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:00.400
"Hey! What are you doing, it's Tuesday,

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:01.180
Why aren't you dressed?"

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:03.220
"Oh yeah, I totally forgot.

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:05.580
Can we skip it? I don't–I don't feel like going."

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:07.600
"This whole thing was your idea."

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:09.700
"I–I know, I just kinda have other things to do,

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:12.040
next week, yeah?"

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:15.740
"Alright."

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:21.980
"You're not gonna get that?"

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:23.340
"I'll call her back after this level.

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:25.800
Hey, watch out!"

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:30.700
Whether it's taking each other for granted,

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:33.600
or people changing over time,

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:36.100
the bottom line is,

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:37.900
someone stops trying,

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:40.320
and feelings aren't as strong as before.

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:44.680
This could happen over a few months, or a few years.

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:47.220
For us,

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:50.900
it was about one and a half years when we hit stage five:

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:52.580
Tolerance.

00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:00.360
"When Marissa and I got to this stage, I couldn't believe it.

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:02.000
You know, I was pretty disappointed.

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:03.840
Somehow,

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:06.740
the girl I was so crazy about a year ago

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:08.320
had turned into someone who just...

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:10.300
wasn't that special anymore.

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:13.400
It happened so gradually that I didn't even see it coming,

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:14.980
but, there we were.

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:16.840
Just tolerating each other."

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:20.320
"Gosh, don't even ask me about my day."

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:21.360
"I won't."

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:23.880
"I swear my coworkers are trying to get me to quit."

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:29.400
"Where do you wanna eat tonight?"

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:31.420
"Wherever you wanna go."

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:33.980
"Can you just decide, I asked you."

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:37.300
"And I'm being flexible, you pick!"

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:39.040
"Jeez, you're like a five year old,

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:40.840
someone has to always tell you what to do."

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:45.240
"Normally I'd let that go,

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:48.840
but I'm having a bad day too so what did you just say?"

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:50.740
Arguing is one thing,

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:53.260
but feeling dissatisfied and unhappy with the

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:54.800
relationship is another.

00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:57.480
We tried various times

00:07:57.780 --> 00:08:00.580
to try and make changes, to fix things,

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:03.380
but like so many couples out there,

00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:05.220
it wasn't enough.

00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:07.480
We became one of those relationships where

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:08.780
it wasn't bad...

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:10.520
but it wasn't great...

00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:12.860
and let me tell you,

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:16.080
that's never a good way to describe a relationship.

00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:19.760
"Well, I guess I'm gonna sleep now."

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:21.100
"Ok."

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:23.400
"Goodnight."

00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:24.000
"Night."

00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:31.000
It wasn't long before we were in stage six:

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.220
Downhill.

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:35.220
There's not much time left once you're here.

00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:37.780
The effort to try to make things work

00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:40.740
just, isn't worth it anymore

00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:44.360
"Problems continue, arguments don't get solved.

00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:47.780
I don't even really remember what we argued about."

00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:49.220
"I can't talk to you right now, you're–"

00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:51.300
"Why won't you just–"

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:53.160
"I can't believe that–"

00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:54.860
"Well how could you just–"

00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:57.440
What did we argue about?

00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:00.040
Marissa and I,

00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:01.700
sad to say,

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:04.940
are nearing the end of this stage.

00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:08.140
What's next is what happens to everyone at some point,

00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:11.420
the end of the line,

00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:14.340
the worst stage ever:

00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:17.040
Breaking Up.

00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:20.620
I don't know when it'll happen, or how,

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:25.620
but I hope we can leave it on good, mutual terms.

00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:28.100
If that's ever, truly, possible.

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:30.320
"I think it's for the best."

00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:31.300
"Fine."

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:35.120
And this is when the two of us will start a new path,

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:37.760
one that leads right back to where we started:

00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:40.660
Strangers.

00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:44.820
The change will be so drastic, and so blunt,

00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:47.960
that we'll probably wanna get back together right away.

00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:50.120
Just to restore what's normal.

00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:52.160
"Hello?"

00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:54.740
"Hey, Marissa.

00:09:58.620 --> 00:09:59.640
I miss you."

00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:01.840
"Are you drunk?"

00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:08.280
But this doesn't always happen,

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:10.440
and the distance will grow.

00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:14.120
Eventually, the two of us will move on,

00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:15.500
or find someone new.

00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:16.560
"Oh my gosh.

00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:22.040
Don. Don! Do–Don! Come–

00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:23.560
Don!

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:26.940
Who is that? Who is she with? Tell me who that is."

00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:31.620
"Sorry, man."

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:36.520
And even when we both get over the past,

00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:38.400
and try to remain friends,

00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:40.580
things will never be the same.

00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:41.900
"Josh?"

00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:44.740
"Hey! It is you!"

00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:45.720
"Woah, Marissa!"

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:47.140
"Hi, nice to see you!"

00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:49.320
"Yeah, you too. You–still run around here?"

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:51.320
"Well, when I visit home, yeah."

00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:52.620
"Visit?"

00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:55.220
"Yea, I moved up to San Francisco a couple months ago,

00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:57.060
but I'm just here to show my boyfriend the park."

00:10:57.060 --> 00:10:57.720
"Oh, cool."

00:10:58.040 --> 00:10:59.240
"Oh, he's right here.

00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:02.040
Josh, this is Alex. Alex, Josh."

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:02.720
"Hi."

00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:07.340
*Dreams to punch Josh*

00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:12.460
"Nice to meet you, man."

00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:15.280
"Well, uh, we should catch up some time,

00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:16.440
I'll talk to you later, okay?"

00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:17.180
"Sure."

00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:22.700
Our lives will continue on in different directions,

00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:24.460
toward the inevitable end:

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:26.880
Becoming strangers, again.

00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:31.420
"And everything we shared will just become fragmented memories.

00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:33.480
From so long ago,

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:36.300
I'll question if it... even really happened.

00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:39.900
And all that'll be left,

00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:41.580
is this.

00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:44.300
A box of random stuff

00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:47.200
from a faded period of time when

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:50.540
this stranger

00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:52.920
was the most important person in my life."

00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:00.180
"What a shame."

00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:16.200
This is to remind you of how hard you fell for me when

00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:17.080
we first met.

00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:20.900
Josh, I'm so glad we have each other in our lives.

00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:24.800
I know that no matter what, we'll always make it through and,

00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:27.820
and we'll always have tomorrow together.

00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:29.840
Happy anniversary.

00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:41.100
"Holy crap!"

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.380
"What the hell are you doing?"

00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:45.700
"Sorry, sorry, I'm–

00:12:46.220 --> 00:12:49.820
I mean, I mean, I'm– I'm sorry, Marissa.

00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:54.720
It's just the potluck, I don't know why I was being so difficult."

00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:56.020
"It's whatever."

00:12:56.020 --> 00:12:58.840
"No, no! It's not whatever, it's important to us.

00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:01.840
I mean not the potluck, just–

00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:05.460
This, this is important to us. To me.

00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:09.040
Let's not do that anymore."

00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:12.900
"I'm sorry, please?"

00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:16.380
"Okay."

00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:19.800
"Yeah? We're okay?"

00:13:21.380 --> 00:13:25.220
"I'm sorry, I'm being dumb. I'm so sorry–

00:13:25.220 --> 00:13:26.500
"We're gonna be okay, yeah?"

00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:29.060
"It's alright, babe."

00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:57.120
"Do you realize, there's only two options for our future together?"

00:13:58.380 --> 00:13:59.500
"It's either...

00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:01.260
"we break up or...

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:03.040
"we get married."

00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:06.880
"Never really thought of that."

00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:09.960
"Think we'll get married?"

00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:12.720
"Jeez, that's a loaded question."

00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:15.820
"Why, you wanna get married to me?"

00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:18.740
"I don't know right now."

00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:21.580
"Me neither."

00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:26.320
"Do you wanna break up with me?"

00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:31.300
"Course not."

00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:35.220
"Well, it's gonna be one or the other."

00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:43.120
"What do you think will happen if we don't

00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:44.540
end up together?"

00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:48.800
"Are we gonna hate each other?"

00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:52.560
"Think we'll keep in touch?"

00:14:57.840 --> 00:14:58.720
"I think...

00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:03.160
that, if life separates us,

00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:06.760
and we end up in totally different places,

00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:12.220
we'll always remember when our paths aligned for this period of time,

00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:14.940
and I'll be thankful for that,

00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:20.620
and hope that wherever you are,

00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:22.500
you'll be thankful too.

00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:27.300
And I think that's the best we can wish for.

00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:41.620
