00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:09.660
Nice guys finish last. That's how it is. That's how it's always gonna be.

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:10.840
Are you gonna see friends?

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:12.080
I just want to feel bad.

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.019
Nice guy, huh?

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:17.270
Don't think of it as you're missing out on Anna, okay?

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:21.520
Try to think of it as you're dodging her because she wasn't right for you,

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:24.019
and there's a reason it's not happening.

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.000
I wish I were that reason.

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:37.140
You always hear guys say "Nice guys finish last." When have you ever heard girls say "Nice girls finish last."?

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:43.840
Well guess what? It happens. I guess I'm that girl.

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:51.230
Hi, everyone!

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:56.289
Let me first start off by saying thank you, I wasn't expecting such a big response to my video.

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:01.898
I guess the whole nice guy, nice girl topic is a pretty big deal to a lot of you.

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.169
I'm glad, 'cause it's a big deal to me too.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:13.690
Yesterday, Justin and I were hanging out with Matt, and he's still going on and on about how unfair this whole situation with Anna is.

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.360
Like you want to talk about unfair?

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.600
Hello?

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:23.440
Anyway, it seems like you guys all had some really good opinions.

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.400
So let me pull up some of my favorite comments.

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:33.980
Josh said "it's hard to believe in nice girls. Girls always seem to have other options for them that

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:34.839
they're happy to take."

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:40.240
It may look like that on the outside, but it doesn't matter if 100 guys like you

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:41.949
if that one guy doesn't return your feelings.

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.769
Jessica makes a good point. "Girls don't complain because we never really take any action.

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:52.359
Unless we actually confess to our feelings, we have no reason to complain."

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.880
I guess it's true that most of the time guys are the ones who speak out,

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.729
and so they probably feel the rejection more often.

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:02.869
V says

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:06.520
"I believe there is no such thing as who's a bad or nice person.

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.279
People who finish last would be people who didn't take chances."

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:13.089
You're right. The word nice gets thrown around too much.

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:18.190
I mean, everyone thinks they're nice. Matt does, and he has no idea what I'm going through.

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.760
Cam says "The difference is

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.700
girls tend to find the fault in themselves,

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.919
while boys blame the girl to make themselves feel better."

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:31.839
Nancy agrees, "Girls blame it on their insecurities instead."

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:34.959
That's probably true.

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.609
Gray says "I don't think nice guys or nice girls finish last.

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:44.439
I believe that each person needs to learn how to be patient enough for the right person."

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.660
But, how am I supposed to know who's right or not?

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.829
I guess we'll see.

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.180
And when I find out, Jan's advice will be the truest.

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.989
"If you don't finish first, you were probably in the wrong race."

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:02.019
That's a good one.

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:05.739
Well, I gotta say, you guys are really thoughtful.

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:11.410
Yeah, I might be jumping to conclusions, but... I can't help it.

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:14.049
I guess I should just take my own advice.

00:03:14.359 --> 00:03:16.629
There's a reason it's not happening.

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:22.029
We don't really know we're finishing last, because we can't tell how things will end.

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:24.669
Well at least I can't.

00:03:25.669 --> 00:03:30.789
We have practice in a couple days, so I wonder how Matt's gonna handle seeing Anna again.

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:36.980
I guess I'll just have to fill you guys in next week. Thank you guys so much for your comments. Bye!
