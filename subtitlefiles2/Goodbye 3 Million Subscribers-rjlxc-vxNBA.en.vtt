00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:13.560
*sigh*

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.700
*knocking at the door*

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.640
Happy 3 million subscribers!

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:40.960
Hey Chris, thanks.

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.100
Congratulations! 3 million- 3- Hey!

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.660
I meant to buy more, but... I'm poor.

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:51.700
Hey, where is everyone?

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:52.680
How come you're not celebrating?

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:54.080
Nothing to celebrate.

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.580
Dude, it's a huge milestone.

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:00.940
Chris, we've been doing this for fifteen years.

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.360
And we just hit three million.

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:05.700
I know! That's so many!

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.320
There's other channels that are at thirty million

00:01:08.323 --> 00:01:10.360
and they got there in a fraction of the time.

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.920
Phil, you shouldn't compare yourself to other people.

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.040
It doesn't change the truth.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.840
We're old on YouTube, Chris.

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.860
People that started watching us in high school are having children now.

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.049
It's time we just accepted the inevitable.

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.809
Wait, uh, hold on. What are you saying?

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.360
This contract terminates our lease on this office...

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.480
What?!

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:40.060
...and I just signed it right before you got here.

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.560
Why?

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.920
When we hit 3 million today

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.060
It was like a wake-up call.

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.060
I realized Wong Fu has actually been holding all of us back.

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.280
So I'm going to let everyone go and

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:54.860
shutting it down.

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.000
Wait. Hold on. Are you- are you crazy?

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.680
No, I have been crazy for

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.540
trying to make it work for this long on the wrong path.

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.900
The world obviously wants to watch other channels now, okay?

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.800
Not- No, not me! I don't.

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:14.100
Okay is there any way I can change your mind?

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:16.560
Not unless you can go back in time

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.040
and convince me to do things a different way.

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.340
So you're saying that if you were bigger Youtubers

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:26.960
you would not shut down Wong Fu?

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:29.600
It doesn't matter now, we'll never know.

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:35.040
Um

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.560
I, uh uh, have to go.

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:41.440
I'll see you later!

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:49.740
I have to save Wong Fu.

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.500
*zapping*

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:59.020
Wes: I have some ideas too actually

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:00.360
Phil: Really?

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:02.740
So what do you say guys? Should we give this a try?

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.600
Nahhh! *chuckling*

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.180
*Lightning crackling*

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:26.340
Where are they?

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:29.540
Hey, hey guys um

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:31.620
Have you heard of Wong Fu Productions?

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:33.200
No, what's that?

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.320
Oh no. I'm too late.

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:43.480
So Wes, Ted, and Phil were joyous again

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.500
Thankful for their videos, their fans, and their friends,

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.440
the holidays had taught the trio

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.520
to see, that being together made them the best they could-

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:56.320
Past Chris: Who are you?

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:57.300
Future Chris: I'm Chris.

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:58.140
Past Chris: No, no, I'm Chris.

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:59.240
Future Chris: No, no, don't panic.

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:00.320
I'm you but from the future.

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:02.700
Past Chris: Are you the ghost of Christmas future?

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:04.720
Future Chris: No. I'm Chris from the future

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:05.457
Past Chris: That doesn't make any sense.

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:06.960
I just came back from the future.

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:08.720
Future Chris: Look something terrible has happened.

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:09.940
Okay, you have to come with me.

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:11.460
The future of Wong Fu depends on it.

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:15.340
Okay.

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:19.740
Ted: Dang Phil that's messed up.

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:21.700
I didn't do anything. I didn't do anything!

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:23.920
I locked myself in my room for three months

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:25.320
to deal with the pain and the grief.

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:26.420
I'm really sorry Billy

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:27.700
-I hate you! -No I'm sorr-

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.120
Phil: Oh my god!

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:32.120
Phil: Are you crazy?

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:33.920
That was uncalled for.

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:34.420
*slaps* Billy: AHH!

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:36.060
Let's get outta here! Geez!

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:37.040
Go go go!

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:41.020
Wong Fu for life.

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:42.120
Wong Fu for life!

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:42.960
Wong Fu for life!

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:44.120
One million subscribers!

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:50.700
I think we lost them, Wes.

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:51.600
Wes?

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:52.320
*grunting*

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:54.440
That was so crazy.

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:57.200
Phil?

00:04:58.980 --> 00:04:59.540
Phil where'd you go?

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:00.640
*struggling*
Chris: *whispering* stop, stop

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:02.620
Ted we're over here

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:03.820
I'm here to help

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:07.540
Wes: Where'd Phil go?

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.540
Ted: I don't know. Let's go.

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:13.140
Get off me!

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:14.400
Hold on, hold on, wait wait.

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.760
Dude Chris. What are you doing?

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:17.600
Thank God I finally found you.

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:19.120
What are you talking about?

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:20.560
And why'd you cut your hair?

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:22.440
Look, it's a long story. I can't explain

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:24.240
I just need you to shut up and listen

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:26.280
because the future of Wong Fu depends on it.

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:27.720
what do you mean?

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:30.240
Phil, I am from the future

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:32.340
It's really a bad joke, man.

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:34.300
No, I am. I can prove it.

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:34.920
Ask me anything.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.640
Okay, fine. Uh...who's president?

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:38.560
Uh...Ugh.

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:41.220
Just ask me anything else.

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:42.600
You're wasting my time.

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:44.840
No, hold on, wait. Listen.

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:50.140
Phil, how many girls did you love before me?

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:51.940
*suspenseful music*

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:54.920
What did you say?

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:57.580
How many girls did you love before me?

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.260
That's a line from a short

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:01.580
that you have not made yet.

00:06:02.199 --> 00:06:03.600
I haven't told anyone about that.

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:05.880
Well, you make it next year, and it's called

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:06.380
(simultaneously) The Last!

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:07.080
*gasp*

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:09.720
So, it's true. You are from the future.

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:10.960
How?

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:11.560
Why?

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:14.020
Look Phil, I've been jumping through dimensions in time

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:14.740
to come back here

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:16.920
and help you change the course of Wong Fu.

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:19.080
Why would I want to do that?

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:21.480
Well, the day I left, you hit three million subs.

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:23.840
That's great! We just hit 1 million.

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:24.900
How many till three?

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:25.720
Like two years? One year?

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:26.520
Seven.

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:28.400
Oh my god.

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:30.560
Yeah the crazy thing is, three million

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:32.260
Isn't even that much in 2018.

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:35.440
You have channels that have ten, thirty, fifty million subs

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:36.620
and they do it all in a year.

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:38.220
What? How?

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.980
I mean, the number one guy?

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:42.240
He plays video games.

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:44.720
People watch other people play video games

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:45.500
on YouTube?

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:47.240
A lot of them were already famous on Vine.

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:47.980
What's Vine?

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:49.540
Uh, Ryan's doing well.

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:50.940
He's at 20 million. He moved to Vegas.

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:52.920
KevJumba! He's back!

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:54.120
He was gone?

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:56.580
Yeah, I mean the Internet. YouTube.

00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:58.460
It's nothing like it is here in 2011.

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:00.280
W-w-well, what about Wong Fu? How are we doing?

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:03.680
Well, uh, Ted is happily living in New York.

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:06.140
You guys end up hiring a lot of great friends,

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:08.040
make a ton of shorts, and... uh,

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:09.440
Single by 30!

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:12.020
I'm single at 30?

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:13.780
No no, that's a series that you make.

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:14.340
*sigh of relief*

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:16.000
And yes.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:16.820
Dammit.

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:18.260
Oh, we make a movie.

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:19.380
That's not so bad.

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:20.300
And Cathy gets married.

00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:23.280
NOOOOOOOO

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:27.920
No, Cathy married?

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:31.340
Chris I can't take any more of this.

00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:33.340
What did you come here to tell me?

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:36.160
The day I left you shut down Wong Fu Productions.

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:37.759
What?

00:07:37.759 --> 00:07:39.320
Even though you hit three million subs

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:42.068
you kept comparing yourself to other people,

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:43.840
and you questioned if you, Wes, and Ted

00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:45.340
took Wong Fu in the right direction.

00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:48.860
Ultimately, you felt like you did it all wrong.

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:51.640
Oh my god

00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:54.660
I came back to give you a chance to change the future

00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:57.180
You told me that if you had done things differently

00:07:57.180 --> 00:07:58.360
and you had just focused

00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:00.140
on being a big, popular YouTube channel,

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.140
you'd be happy and you wouldn't shut it down.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.660
I think you wasted your time...

00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:09.400
...travel.

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:10.400
Wait, what?

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:14.160
Big Youtuber? We never wanted that.

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:17.580
We didn't start Wong Fu to be 'famous and popular'

00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:21.340
We did it because we loved making and telling stories

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.400
and if we're still going in this crazy time of 2018,

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:29.960
making videos, even a movie,

00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:32.020
with the support of our fans still and we got to do it with

00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:32.980
good people along the way.

00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:35.660
I'm happy with that.

00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:38.460
And I think Wes and Ted would be too

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:40.300
Yeah, you didn't say any of that.

00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:42.920
Well, what about everything you said in 2018?

00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:44.000
I'm wrong.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.260
I must have forgotten what's really important,

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:47.440
and it's up to you

00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:51.180
to remind me of everything we said here today.

00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:52.960
How?

00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:55.780
*pats shoulder*

00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:57.380
You'll think of something.

00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:01.320
No, seriously, how?

00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:05.100
Hey, what else happens in the world in 2018?

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:08.180
I don't know, I mean Disney buys Star Wars.

00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:09.280
They make three more movies.

00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:11.280
LeBron goes back to Cleveland.

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:12.440
They win a championship.

00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:14.440
Kanye marries Kim Kardashian and

00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:17.220
Twitter has 280 characters.

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:19.500
*snorts*

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:23.260
280? You're a character.

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:26.920
Quit messing with me though.

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:31.060
Hey, good luck.

00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:33.080
Thanks Chris.

00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:36.540
Oh, uh. Before I go I need you to look over here.

00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:37.480
What? *slaps* Oh

00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:39.160
*through teeth* What the heck Chris?

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:40.540
Oh, sorry, wrong hand.

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:41.180
What?

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:41.780
*slaps again* *thunder crackles*

00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:46.860
What the hell?

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:51.240
Phil where you been?

00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:54.280
I was running and then I'm

00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:58.040
here?  I don't really remember anything else.

00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:00.020
We've been looking the whole neighborhood for you.

00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:02.620
Sorry, what happened?

00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:04.720
Well you okay?

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:07.060
I think so. What did we...what just happened?

00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:08.400
Well, I slapped a guy.

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:09.460
You slapped a guy?!

00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:11.180
Yeah 1 million subscribers. Feels pretty good.

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:12.780
I feel like I just got slapped.

00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:32.540
*knocking at the door*

00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:52.680
What the heck?

00:10:57.680 --> 00:10:59.200
Chris voiceover: Hi Phil, it's Chris.

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:02.540
If I recall correctly, you're just about to sign a paper

00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:04.820
to close down Wong Fu productions.

00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:08.020
I wanted to tell you that I'm writing from the future

00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:10.620
and it's imperative that you keep Wong Fu going.

00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:12.680
I can't tell you why yet,

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:15.180
but when you get here, I'll explain everything.

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:17.560
See you at 4 million.

00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:20.780
Oh, and if you don't believe any of this,

00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:24.500
your show idea, "Yappie"  turns out really, really great.

00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:34.140
*Star Wars ending credits song plays*

00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:36.120
I love this movie.

00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:39.260
We should make a short about time traveling.

00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:41.660
Let's go Wes.

00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:42.520
We got work to do.

00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:43.980
Right now?

00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:44.740
You wanna do it right now?

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:47.100
Ted in the background: Wong Fu for Life!

00:12:35.180 --> 00:12:36.220
I think we lost them, Wes!

00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:37.160
Wes?

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:38.100
*Chris tackles*

00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:39.140
*grunting*

00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:39.640
Wes?

00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:41.140
*Chris tackles*

00:12:41.140 --> 00:12:41.640
Wes?

00:12:42.020 --> 00:12:44.240
*Chris tackles* (x2)

00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:45.040
Wes?

00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:45.820
*Chris tackles*

00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:46.860
Wes?

00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:49.660
I can prove it ask me. Ask me anything.

00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:51.780
Okay fine. Uh, who's president?

00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:54.860
Ask me something else.

00:12:54.860 --> 00:12:55.980
You're wasting my time.

00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:00.460
Fine who's president?

00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:06.320
Ok fine, who's president?

00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:09.640
Ah that's not gonna...

00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:12.000
you're not gonna believe me. Ask anything else.
