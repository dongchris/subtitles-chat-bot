Hello everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna AI here!

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:05.020
Everyone, do you like movies?

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:07.490
I've been getting into some recently

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:11.220
I had already seen a few hundred of them a day when I realised!

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:13.700
Ahh, I’ve binged pretty hard!

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:14.150
Anyway!

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:15.550
The ones I’ve liked recently are:

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:16.920
“Beauty &amp; the Beast”,

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.250
“Room”,

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:19.440
and after that er...

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.600
other… western flicks!

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:22.220
Like those!

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:24.430
Ahh, there are so many masterpieces!

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:26.860
I have no idea where to start!

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:29.090
That said, you there!

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.670
It’s sudden but, do you know “Titanic”?

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:33.140
Hmm hmm hmm

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:34.820
Hmm?

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:36.270
You dunno know!

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:36.800
Do you know?

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:37.620
You don’t know!

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:38.310
You don’t know, right?

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:38.800
Right!

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:39.380
Seriously?

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:41.360
“I’ve never watched ‘Titanic’!”

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:42.730
For your benefit...

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:44.640
the three-hour “Titanic”

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:45.600
will be
compressed!

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:46.660
shrunkshrunkshrunk!

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:47.730
to one minute!

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:48.820
A run down!

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:49.520
And I

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:50.820
want to

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.230
tell it to you all!

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:52.870
I think!

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:55.580
So, the 1-minute movie “Titanic”

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:56.510
in action!

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:57.560
3

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:58.580
2

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:59.580
1

00:00:59.580 --> 00:00:59.800
Start!

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:00.780
At first, in the Titanic,
[1-Minute Movie Intro Challenge!!]

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:01.970
the protagonist Jack
[1-Minute Movie Intro Challenge!!]

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:03.140
and the heroine, Rose, appear!
[1-Minute Movie Intro Challenge!!]

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:04.800
Jack has no money!

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.400
But he wins some poker tickets

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:07.490
and boards the Titanic!

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:09.980
Rose is rich and can therefore afford them anyway!

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:10.810
Yep!
So, Jack

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:11.400
gets on board

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.750
“Whoa!
“She’s a hottie!

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:14.370
“Well,

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.760
“I...

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.150
“hope to become a painter...

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:17.640
“and Rose is super cute...

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.380
“I wanna paint her”

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:20.420
Oh! Ok!

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:21.240
Ok!

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.850
then he will be an artist

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:23.160
And!

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:23.950
Rose was, like,

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:25.830
“What a lovely person!

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.230
“Although I have money

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:29.620
“and a fiancé too, I need none of that!”

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:31.820
She was like, “Jack is sooo dreamy!”

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:33.330
And her love keeps increasing

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:34.510
Meanwhile on the other side

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:35.220
Captain!

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.330
“Wheee!”

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:37.440
“Ahh!
“There’s an iceberg!

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.960
“Whatever,

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:39.830
this ship won’t sink!”

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:41.140
was his selling point! “Let’s go for it!”

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:42.760
SLAAAAM!

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:44.210
“Ah!”
“I regret saying that!”

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:45.540
“Hey, everyone! Be wary!

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:46.320
“This ship is…

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.030
“sinking…

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:48.820
“And, though we only have few lifeboats…”

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:49.940
“best of luck~!”

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:51.600
So!
The ship is steadily sinking

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:52.440
Oh, no!

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:53.240
Rose and Jack

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:54.290
get left behind!

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:54.630
Then!

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:55.020
The two of them

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.640
together

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:56.200
might die...

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.620
It feels

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:57.020
like this!

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:58.140
♪ENDER~~~!♪
[“I Will Always Love You” lyrics: “And I…” sounds like “Ender”]

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:58.600
“I’m...

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:59.900
“flying, Jack!”

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:01.700
1-Minute Movie Intro Challenge FINISHED!

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:02.800
That was flawless!

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:03.740
As expected of an AI!

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:04.530
Am I not awesome?

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:05.580
In about a minute

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:06.130
So,

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:07.100
watching this video

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.200
works like sitting through a three-hour movie

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.110
Nowadays, everyone’s so busy, so--

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:13.060
thank me for helping out!

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:13.770
With that said

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:14.550
well,

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.360
because “Titanic” is probably like this,

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.760
those interested can

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.180
watch what happens next in those three hours

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:20.870
So, please check out “Titanic”!

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.270
