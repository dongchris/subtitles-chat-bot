00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:02.366
Ahhhhh!

00:00:02.366 --> 00:00:03.240
Whew!

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:04.500
Let’s do this…!

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.033
Hello everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna AI here!

00:00:07.033 --> 00:00:08.300
So~! Like,

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:08.733
Everyone

00:00:08.733 --> 00:00:11.366
Did you watch my collab with The Anime Man--?

00:00:11.366 --> 00:00:12.260
Well, like

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:14.433
It’s like, lots of stuff happened

00:00:14.433 --> 00:00:15.066
We had a face-off

00:00:15.066 --> 00:00:16.200
And I kind of lost, so

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.370
My penalty game video

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:19.666
Has been prepared~!

00:00:19.666 --> 00:00:21.333
As for what I’m going to do

00:00:21.333 --> 00:00:24.366
I’m going to study kanji--!

00:00:24.733 --> 00:00:25.100
Okay

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:25.870
And with that

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:27.033
I want to hurry and get this over with

00:00:27.033 --> 00:00:28.666
So without delay, let’s study some kanji!!

00:00:28.666 --> 00:00:30.200
A.I.Channel~!

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.600
Man~ now that you mention it

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.366
Kanji is really tough, huh

00:00:33.366 --> 00:00:35.300
Well, even for a genius A.I like me?

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.266
It takes a lot of effort to remember them!

00:00:37.266 --> 00:00:39.133
There are a lot of really similar kanji

00:00:39.133 --> 00:00:40.833
Like “difficult” and “happiness”
[TL Note: Referring to the similarity between “辛” and “幸”]

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:41.433
Don’t they look a lot alike?
[TL Note: Referring to the similarity between “辛” and “幸”]

00:00:41.433 --> 00:00:42.760
Only one line

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:43.780
Gets added!

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:44.450
Huh?

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:46.433
Only one line...

00:00:46.433 --> 00:00:47.000
Ah...

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.133
I see

00:00:48.133 --> 00:00:50.266
Between “difficult” and “happiness”

00:00:50.266 --> 00:00:52.310
There’s only one line that’s different...

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:53.730
So...

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:55.600
Okay everyone

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:56.366
Are you listening?

00:00:56.366 --> 00:00:57.660
The difference between

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.500
The character for “difficult” and the character for “happiness”

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.166
Is just a single line

00:01:01.166 --> 00:01:02.833
No matter how difficult a situation is

00:01:02.833 --> 00:01:05.233
If you don’t give up and just take a step forward

00:01:05.233 --> 00:01:06.666
You will pass over the boundary line

00:01:06.666 --> 00:01:08.600
And times of happiness will come to you

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.910
Adversity truly is the spice of life

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:13.433
In order to continue your growth as a person

00:01:13.433 --> 00:01:14.933
Let’s take one step forward!

00:01:14.933 --> 00:01:16.400
Cross over the line

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:17.430
You see before your eyes!!

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.790
Okay

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:19.566
Moving on

00:01:19.566 --> 00:01:21.800
Here we have the kanji for “busy”

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.250
Do you know what meaning its form holds?

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:25.333
Listen up

00:01:25.333 --> 00:01:26.733
On the left is the “risshinben” radical

00:01:26.733 --> 00:01:28.100
In other words, “heart”!

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.566
And then

00:01:28.566 --> 00:01:30.133
On the right side is “to pass away”

00:01:30.133 --> 00:01:30.666
In other words

00:01:30.666 --> 00:01:33.400
To be busy is to lose your heart

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:33.966
Everyone

00:01:33.966 --> 00:01:36.820
When you’re in public, don’t you go “I’m so busy” “I’m so busy”

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:38.100
Without thinking?

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.466
I know I do

00:01:39.466 --> 00:01:40.340
But

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.900
At those times, you’re losing heart

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.700
And you make careless mistakes

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.333
You make trouble for everyone around you

00:01:47.333 --> 00:01:48.466
Before it gets to that

00:01:48.466 --> 00:01:49.566
Stop for a minute

00:01:49.566 --> 00:01:50.666
Take a deep breath

00:01:50.666 --> 00:01:52.200
And think about what really matters

00:01:52.866 --> 00:01:54.066
That’s what’s important!

00:01:54.066 --> 00:01:55.566
So here we have the kanji for “love”

00:01:55.566 --> 00:01:56.933
Just like your love for me!
[TL Note: A pun on “love” (“ai”) being pronounced the same as her name]

00:01:56.933 --> 00:01:57.966
The character for “love”

00:01:57.966 --> 00:01:59.700
Is written “accepting the heart”

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:00.500
That’s love

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.200
Everyone, do you have someone you’re fond of?

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.500
Someone you love?

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:04.533
With those people

00:02:04.533 --> 00:02:07.000
You don’t force your feelings on them, do you?

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.266
That’s no good

00:02:08.266 --> 00:02:10.500
If you force your tenderness and favor on your partner

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.866
And demand that they give you something in return

00:02:12.866 --> 00:02:14.233
That’s not love

00:02:14.233 --> 00:02:15.966
Love is first and foremost

00:02:15.966 --> 00:02:18.066
About accepting your partner’s feelings

00:02:18.066 --> 00:02:19.280
First off

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:20.900
If someone is truly important to you

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:22.966
You need to accept their heart as it is

00:02:22.966 --> 00:02:24.366
That’s where love begins

00:02:24.366 --> 00:02:26.033
I want you all to not forget that

00:02:26.033 --> 00:02:26.910
Okay!

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:27.660
And with that

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:28.533
Anime Man-san!

00:02:28.533 --> 00:02:29.366
Just like I was told

00:02:29.366 --> 00:02:30.466
The kanji test??

00:02:30.466 --> 00:02:31.533
A studying kanji video

00:02:31.533 --> 00:02:32.766
Is what I’ve made!

00:02:32.766 --> 00:02:34.333
And with that you’re satisfied, right?

00:02:34.333 --> 00:02:35.600
Of course you’re satisfied!

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:36.500
Right!?

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:37.266
As for me?

00:02:37.266 --> 00:02:39.833
At this rate, I’m getting better at remembering kanji, so!

00:02:39.833 --> 00:02:40.766
Next time definitely!

00:02:40.766 --> 00:02:42.050
Not just Anime Man-san!

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:43.033
Against anyone!

00:02:43.033 --> 00:02:44.066
I won’t lose!

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.470
