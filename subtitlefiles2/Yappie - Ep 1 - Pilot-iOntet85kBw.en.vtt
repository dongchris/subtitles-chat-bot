00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:24.520
Hello America.

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:31.240
I'm an Asian -- an Asian American to be exact, a Filipino American if you want extra credit points.

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:32.840
You've seen some of us around.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.640
We're part of that ensemble cast of that awesome action movie.

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:41.860
*ding*

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.860
We're the ones in your high school that you always want to cheat off of.

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:54.320
What are you doing?

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.320
Changing all my answers to the right ones.

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.100
[Teacher] Okay class, pencils down.

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:03.060
[Poet] And we're that porn tag you're not so ashamed about.

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:05.080
I'm Nicole.

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.860
You look like you need the secret Asian massage.

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.200
[Poet] Oh, you know us. Well, you think you know us.

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:15.940
And that's why you never asked about us!

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.160
That's why you don't care about us!

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.960
Why?? You say "model minority".

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.080
I say:

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.880
Invisible minority.

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.160
Afterthought minority.

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:31.560
(Applause)

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:32.680
And now it's time to--

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:35.380
(Phone interrupts: Basketball game)

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.540
I'm sorry, you want to finish double tapping?

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.140
Sorry, sorry--

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:48.280
[Poet] No no no. No, you look new here. What's your name?

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.120
Um..

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:51.800
...Andrew.

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:53.640
(scoff) Andrew...

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:57.969
You know if you met an Asian guy, there's a 1 in 13 chance his name is...Andrew.

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.220
There's a 1 in 5 chance he's an engineer.

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.220
(audience laughter)

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.160
Let me guess, Andrew. You're from the San Gabriel Valley,

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:11.120
You like basketball, Boyz II Men, and BMWs?

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.240
Andrew, you're like the basic bitch of Asian dudes.

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.640
(Laughter)

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.400
But we all are, in our own way.

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.860
(whispering) Wow, this guy's super rude, right?

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.380
He's an extremely accomplished speaker.

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:27.960
Also, why were you on your phone?

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:34.160
I thought we were going to a comedy show, not some wanna-be TED talk that I had to take notes for.

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.500
[Poet] ...speaking of the San Gabriel Valley,

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.560
I just read an article that said that

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.680
Asians were gentrifying that area.

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.920
Us? Asians? Gentrifying?

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.520
I thought that was a white thing.

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:51.520
Now, it's us too?

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.320
That made me realize something.

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.320
Asian people:

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.200
We, like, get the sampler platter of racism.

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.560
We get the mozzarella sticks of being new, freeloading immigrants.

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.600
We get the potato wedges of being communist enemies of the free world,

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.700
and a few buffalo wings of segregation via internment camps.

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:17.200
And now to top all that, people are saying we get white privilege?

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:18.800
I mean, seriously,

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:23.840
What other ethnic group in America get to try on every kind of stereotype?

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.140
We have the whole menu, but like damn,

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:28.540
I'm full.

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:34.920
(Applause)

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:56.840
Hey guys.

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:58.480
Ollie, great job up there.

00:03:58.480 --> 00:03:59.920
Thank you.

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.000
And again, sorry for the phone thing. It's just been a crazy day.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.600
Um...what are you guys talking about?

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:09.560
Ollie was just expanding on his platter analogy.

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:11.580
Oh my god. That was so funny.

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:15.960
It's not...a joke.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.720
Right. No, I meant like it's a really good observation.

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.680
I've never thought of things like that.

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:30.300
Would you say this is exactly why we're considered the "model minority"?

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:36.300
We get it all, but we don't say shit, and we won't say shit because no one thinks of us in those individual cases?

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:39.760
Exactly. Think about it? Many of us are immigrants,

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:43.600
but we don't have the same illegal alien stigma that Latinos have.

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:48.700
And we're viewed as foreign enemies dating back to World War II, and now with China and North Korea,

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:51.720
but we're not as villainized as people from the Middle East.

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:56.540
And we do have a level of privilege due to our high economic status,

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:58.780
but we're not scrutinized like white people.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.020
And lastly, there were literally laws made to segregate us in the past,

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:11.820
but unlike the black community, the effect of that institutionalized racism is not as prevalent in our communities decades later.

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:19.020
So no one speaks up for us because on the surface and those individual issues, other groups seem to have it worse.

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:21.580
I'm not trying to play Oppression Olympics.

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:22.960
Everyone's dealing with their own shit.

00:05:22.979 --> 00:05:27.259
I'm just trying to say that we can literally relate with every type of hate,

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:30.900
which gives Asian Americans a very unique perspective in this country.

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:33.260
Wow.

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:39.200
It's like we're getting silver medals and everyone else is getting golds.

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:44.300
The Olympics analogy. I thought we were...(cough)

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:46.440
I'm gonna go say bye to some friends.

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:48.160
Um...good luck, Andrew,

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:49.780
and I'll see you later.

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:51.200
Yeah.

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:57.600
Later? What what's going on later?

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:01.220
Oh, a few of the speakers are just going back to Ollie's place to hang out.

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:04.240
Oh. Okay, that's..that's cool.

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:06.240
I guess I've been down to stay out a little longer.

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:09.400
Actually, um...I think we should just call it a night here.

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:12.580
Or just call it.

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:13.940
Here.

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:18.360
Well, what do you mean?

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:22.220
We gave it a shot, right? Three dates?

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:26.560
Oh. This is over?

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:29.160
Is this cause of the phone thing? Or...

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:29.880
No.

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:31.760
I mean, yes.

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:32.960
No.

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:36.880
Okay, look, just cuz I'm not some stand-up/spoken word artist on a soapbox--

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:39.960
Ugh...I knew I shouldn't have swiped on a Yappie.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
A what?

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:45.840
You're a Yappie, Andrew.

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:48.240
Are we doing nicknames now or...?

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:50.960
A young Asian professional who acts like a yuppie?

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:57.800
Cause all you care about is earning a nice salary, and buying a nice car, and settling down in a nice suburb.

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:01.920
That sounds like a nice, normal person.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.740
What's so wrong with that?

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:05.240
It's not wrong.

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:07.240
It's just...

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:09.130
..safe.

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:10.500
Listen, we're just...

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:14.320
...not the right fit. I need to be with someone who you know...

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
...cares, more

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:18.880
about the world.

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:22.000
Hey, I care a ton about the world, okay?

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:25.080
I rounded up my last McDonald's meal like a dollar, got myself one of those

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:27.200
paper balloon things that hang.

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:29.680
That is so not what I'm talking about.

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:32.520
Take it easy, Andrew.

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:36.040
I'm sure you'll find a nice Yappie girl to match you.

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:43.480
(loudly) If I'm a "Yappie", you're a Yippie.

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:45.120
A young hippie.

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:53.240
Thanks.

00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:55.900
(sigh)

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:10.680
(party music)

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:14.600
I mean seriously, who even uses that word "Yappie"?

00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:18.460
Maybe it's what the kids are saying now, like "dad" or "sus" or

00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:19.520
Lil Yachty.

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:21.240
She wasn't a kid, okay?

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:22.360
She was 22.

00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:24.620
Ha, still seven years younger than you man.

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:26.580
That's like getting a PhD twice.

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:29.480
Whatever. She was cute and I'm not gonna say no to a match.

00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:33.680
Still got that college naivete, like she's gonna change the world.

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:36.420
Were we like that in college?

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:39.700
Hell yeah we were. Changing the world one soju bomb at a time.

00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:41.060
Oh my god.

00:08:41.180 --> 00:08:43.880
Look, Drew,  you just gotta date older people alright?

00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:46.400
The ones that have given up at all this hipster shit.

00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:51.940
That's ironic, because the last older girl I dated gave up on me...so what are you saying?

00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:53.800
It always comes back to Lana, huh?

00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:55.080
Lana and I were like--

00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:57.640
Is Andrew sulking about his ex-girlfriend again?

00:08:57.680 --> 00:08:58.180
Ugh..

00:08:58.180 --> 00:08:58.880
Yes, he was.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:00.360
Hey, Melody, Jessica.

00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:02.360
Have you guys heard of this word "Yappie" before?

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:04.360
Yeah, we're all Yappies.

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:06.040
What's a "Yappie"?

00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:07.120
Brett if he were Asian.

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:08.920
Woohoo!! Hey hey!

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:10.880
We drinking what, "Yappies"? What is that?

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:12.560
...whiskey, tequila?

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:15.000
Hey, round-a Yappies on me man!

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:18.940
Is that not what it is?

00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:23.360
(in unison) Our song!

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:26.280
No babe, we just got to the bar!

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:27.760
I'll be right back.

00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:33.316
Doesn't it bug you?

00:09:33.316 --> 00:09:34.640
Brad's dancing?

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:36.560
No. Yappie...

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:39.240
The way this girl said it made it sound like it was a bad thing like...

00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:42.260
Like it's safe.

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:45.460
Well, we are pretty safe.

00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:50.880
Look, we just got 17 dollar cocktails, and we're completely fine.

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:54.200
And we gotta wake up early to meet mom and dad for breakfast tomorrow.

00:09:54.840 --> 00:10:00.760
We live a pretty cushy lifestyle, but we chose the safe route because it's what we wanted.

00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:03.380
It's kind of who we are right?

00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:05.500
It's only a bad thing if it's not.

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:23.740
[Flashback to Poet] You know when if you meet an Asian guy, there is a 1 in 13 chance his name is Andrew?

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:26.600
There's a 1 in 5 chance he's an engineer.

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:28.700
Let me guess, Andrew.

00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:30.940
You like basketball,

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:32.760
Boyz II Men,

00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:34.180
and BMWs?

00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:40.140
[Flashback to date] It's just...safe.

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:43.400
(beep)

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:46.240
[Phone] Andrew, hi, can I see you in my office for a second?

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:48.700
Uh, yeah, I'll... I'll be right there.

00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:56.240
So, Andrew.

00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:00.180
Uh, sorry, it's been so long since your last review.

00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:02.520
It's just been, ugh, crazy in the office.

00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:03.800
(laugh)

00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:05.800
Can barely keep up.

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:09.580
Anyway, I thought we should check in with each other.

00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:10.600
Yeah.

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:12.180
Um, no worries.

00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:12.680
Great.

00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:20.960
So, the last time we talked, you were inquiring about a potential change in department. Possible relocation?

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:25.180
That's right, I remember that.

00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:25.940
Right, so...

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:33.000
Unfortunately, we were unable to make that happen for you this year.

00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:35.600
Oh...

00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:39.320
Uhh. Actually, that's fine.

00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:41.680
Oh.

00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:43.800
Great.

00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:48.640
Well, then from what I can gather, everything else seems fine for you.

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:52.140
Seems like you're pretty comfortable where you are, right?

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:56.500
Andrew?

00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:00.800
Yeah,

00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:06.060
comfortable.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.140
Hey everyone. Thank you so much for watching Episode 1 of "Yappie".

00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:26.200
We are so proud to have made this show and I really really hope that you're excited to watch the upcoming episodes.

00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:27.020
Now check this out,

00:12:27.020 --> 00:12:30.060
We actually have a few options for how you can enjoy the rest of the show.

00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:34.120
Option 1: the entire series is free for everyone to watch each week.

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:38.140
So, if you want to just watch along we'll see you right here next Wednesday.

00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:40.880
No signups. No paywall. None of that.

00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:45.120
The second option is for anyone who can't wait five weeks for the show to finish.

00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:47.880
If you just want to just binge watch all the five episodes right now,

00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:52.660
you can head over to our Vimeo page in the links below and just buy the whole show for just $10.

00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:53.860
That's less than a movie ticket.

00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:56.540
Now if you're a care holder on the Wong Fu Forward Patreon page,

00:12:56.540 --> 00:12:58.380
You're actually going to get some special treatment.

00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:01.600
For the bronze-level, you're going to get to see each episode, one day early.

00:13:01.660 --> 00:13:07.440
And if you're a silver or gold care holder, you'll actually get access to the entire show right now included in your membership.

00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:10.320
So sign up today and get this and all the other perks.

00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:12.000
I hope that wasn't too complicated.

00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:16.880
We just want to give different options to our fans for how they want to support Wong Fu and our work.

00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:20.420
We're super grateful for whichever way you choose to watch.

00:13:20.420 --> 00:13:25.060
Ultimately, we're just working so hard to keep creating high quality content and stories for you all.

00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:32.360
And your direct contributions allowed us to make "Yappie" and enabled us to make more stuff like this and go bigger and better.

00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:34.380
So, please come back to watch each week.

00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:37.060
Share this show with your friends, even buy it if you like.

00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:41.860
Maybe get some "Yappie" merchandise on our store or sign up for our Patreon page.

00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:43.160
It all means so much to us.

00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:44.380
We'll see you guys next week!
