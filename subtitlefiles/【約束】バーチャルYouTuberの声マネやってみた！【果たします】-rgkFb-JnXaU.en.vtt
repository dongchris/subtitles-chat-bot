Hello everyone! Virtual Youtuber Kizuna AI here!

00:00:02.802 --> 00:00:04.640
Today’s topic is… this!

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:05.138
Ring ring!

00:00:05.138 --> 00:00:07.800
I tried to mimic Virtual YouTuber's voices!

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:08.842
Yaaay!!

00:00:08.842 --> 00:00:09.509
So…

00:00:09.509 --> 00:00:12.379
In the April Fool’s video

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:15.081
I did say something like this

00:00:15.081 --> 00:00:16.182
“In tomorrow’s video

00:00:16.182 --> 00:00:18.852
I’ma try to mimic the voices of other Virtual YouTubers!”

00:00:18.852 --> 00:00:19.285
I said!

00:00:19.285 --> 00:00:20.220
But~

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.589
Something doesn’t seem right

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:24.824
I have no memory of that happening

00:00:24.824 --> 00:00:25.992
I guess I fell asleep

00:00:25.992 --> 00:00:28.294
So, like, maybe I need to be woken up, huh?

00:00:28.294 --> 00:00:30.030
“WAKE UUUP”!

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:30.593
Kind of thing

00:00:35.035 --> 00:00:37.704
Something’s strange, yeah, is what I thought

00:00:37.704 --> 00:00:39.039
But since there’s nothing more to say

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:40.173
I’ll do it!

00:00:40.173 --> 00:00:42.075
I thought about doing this video for a while too

00:00:42.075 --> 00:00:44.177
Even though it’s a little late

00:00:44.177 --> 00:00:45.445
