00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.280
Hey! Virtual Youtuber,
Kizuna Ai here!

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:02.800
Today,

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:05.040
we'll try something virtual-ish!

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:05.540
Ta-da!

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:06.660
"Tilt Brush"!

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:07.440
This software

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.600
uses google's

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:09.940
3D space paint tool

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:12.060
with the latest VR system

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:13.300
from HTC Vive

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:15.480
which enables user to draw in that 3D space!

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:16.040
So,

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:19.640
that enables us to draw three-dimensional
picture in a three-dimensional space!

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:20.560
Awesome!

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:21.140
So..

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:22.720
Let's try this as soon as possible!

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:24.220
Since it's New Year,

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:26.460
1. Fuji, 2. Hawk, 3. Eggplant! [1]

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.600
I learned how to draw with this but it's somehow
[Topic: Hatsuyume]

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:30.500
the lines are thick..

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.440
I wonder if you can see this,

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:34.960
but you can change the thickness 
of your brush with this

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:35.620
First of all,

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:37.160
I'll draw Mt. Fuji but...

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.320
We need to sketch first, right?

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.160
Like this...

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.500
We do the sketch...

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:48.540
[fast forwards]

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:49.900
Sketching..

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:52.180
done!

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.960
I've done sketching.

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:54.620
Let's start coloring the mountain

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.600
Since this is

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.500
Mt. Fuji...

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:58.900
I wonder if this is the right color?

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:01.420
I guess this is okay

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:02.460
I'm going to paint now~

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:04.840
The artist Ai-chan..

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:06.380
Ah this is the scratchy brush

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:07.240
lathery brush.

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:08.640
It looks nice..

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.440
Something like this, right?

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:13.680
This is how we're painting it!

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:15.980
[fast forwards]

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.800
I actually

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.380
only used this software for the second time

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:20.320
Isn't it awesome?

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:21.640
In my second time I did this

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.260
like a pro

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:24.740
Look at it!

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:25.660
Can you see it?

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:26.200
Look!

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.220
It becomes a three-dimensional drawings!

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.600
These white lines..

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.660
are the sketches so

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:35.260
let's try and cover them all up, okay?

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:37.480
I'm AI so it doesn't concern me but,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.060
you should find a position so 
your waist doesn't hurt, ok?

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:46.900
[fast forwards]

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:47.700
Uisho~

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:48.520
Compared to

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.160
normal drawings, this makes you move more so..

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:52.700
having fun drawing and

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.660
also able to diet?

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:56.060
Good looking

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.960
three-dimensional thing!

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:58.220
Haa~

00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:59.320
I should've..

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:01.540
made this smaller, should I...?

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:07.800
[fast forwards]

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:09.760
Kizuna Ai, The Artist.

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:11.260
I wonder if this would sell.

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.320
How much for this?

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.200
Since it has a slick finish,

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.240
I guess about ten million yen, huh?

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:17.300
Anyone interested?

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:19.160
Just say "It's New Year Money"

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:20.600
and buy this drawing?

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:22.820
A dandy one with ten million yen?

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.960
[fast forwards]

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:29.040
Ta-da-da-da-dah!

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:30.220
Now we need to

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.280
add white for snow parts of

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:33.480
the mountain top

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:35.460
White color...

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:36.560
selected.

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:44.200
[fast forwards]

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:45.060
Somewhat it's

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:46.460
a bit "that"

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:47.660
a bit "that"

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.580
Oh well, doesn't this look good?

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:50.080
Snow.

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.780
[fast forwards]

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:55.280
Oh

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:57.300
Mm?

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:58.180
It's somewhat

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:59.520
There's not enough snow on this part?

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:04.000
Ta-da-dah!

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:05.020
Ah!

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.520
Poi!

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.520
Now we'll add snow to this thing..

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.380
I can make it snow here!

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:12.540
This changes the size too huh

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:14.000
On the top...

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.380
Look, isn't it awesome?

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:16.920
I made it snowing!!

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:19.400
Kira-kira-kira★

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.800
Let's spread them snow to the sides too!

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.020
What do you think?

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.140
My Fuji Mountain?

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:26.340
The sun~♪

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:28.360
Mr.Sun~♪

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.860
Sun~♪

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:31.980
Now let's draw a sun!

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:32.980
About here seems right

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:36.680
Hoo!

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:39.280
Mm?

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.980
Here's the sun!

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.520
Ah!

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:46.020
Ah! Ah!

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.540
Ah! Ah! Ah!

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:47.800
Ah! If you see it from here,

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:49.880
doesn't it look very good?

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:50.640
Hawk~

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:51.880
Next is hawk, right?

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:53.480
We'll draw a hawk now~

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:54.260
Hawk!

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:55.500
Something like this?

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:56.540
*chuckles*

00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:59.100
The hawk..

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:01.420
that's just looks really sad

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:03.460
hawk

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:05.960
hawk

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.240
It's garbage.

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:14.300
Just bad.

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:17.080
Ah, if we add white here,

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.500
doesn't hawks have white parts on them too?

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:21.660
They have white feathers on their wings

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:25.800
I've made another garbage, didn't I...

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:26.780
Ah!

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:27.340
This!

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:29.040
I've seen this before!

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:30.780
It's going to be mirrored, it said.

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:31.880
With this,

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:34.000
if we do this,

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.820
Look!

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:38.120
If we draw on this part it's drawn there too!

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:43.880
*mumbles*

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:47.300
I can't help but feel this is going to be a trash too

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:58.400
[fast forwards]

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:59.060
There, a hawk!

00:04:59.060 --> 00:04:59.860
Ah, two hawks?
(She's confusing about "2 hawk" part)

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:01.360
2 hawk...

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:03.220
For the eggplant..

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:04.880
we'll just put it on the floor

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:07.240
Eggplant!

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:09.880
Ah, we should use mirror too

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:11.720
This is really handy!

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:16.200
Ah, doesn't it look good?

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.460
I've been waiting for this moment!

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:22.540
Right! Like that!

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:30.700
[fast forwards]

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:32.800
Doesn't it seems to be a delicious eggplant?

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:34.720
Eggplant sure sounds tasty don't you think?

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:36.100
Something like boiled eggplants?

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:37.580
What's left is the stem!

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:46.680
*mumbles*

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:50.680
[fast forwards]

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:52.440
What do you think about this beautiful,

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:53.480
1 Fuji,

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:54.540
1 Fuji, 2 Hawk,

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:55.600
1 Fuji, 2 Hawk, 3 Eggplant?

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:57.480
This is perfect don't you think?

00:05:57.660 --> 00:05:59.420
Don't you think I'm good at this?

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:01.780
My world

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:04.380
was turned into a vast and beautiful scenery!

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:07.440
I wish you can experience that with Virtual Reality too!

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:09.720
You too should come to the Virtual Reality world too!

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:10.480
I'll be waiting!
