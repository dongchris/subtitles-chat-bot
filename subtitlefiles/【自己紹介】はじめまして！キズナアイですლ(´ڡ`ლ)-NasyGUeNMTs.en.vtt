00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:03.480
Umm...

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:04.600
Uhm..

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:06.620
Is the camera on?

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.680
Hmm, can you hear me?

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.060
Nice to meet you,

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:11.700
my name is Kizuna Ai!

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:13.480
Pleased to meet you!

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:15.640
"She doesn't look like normal youtuber,
you know?"

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:17.560
...to people who thought of that,

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:19.480
It's not far off

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:21.160
you know, I'm actually...

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:22.280
2-D!

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:22.820
Eh?

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:25.480
You're 3D so it's actually 3-D?

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:26.980
Hmm, well..

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:28.840
Take it that I'm virtual

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.560
Don't you think "virtual youtuber"
sounds really cool?

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:32.680
Because of that,

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.940
I'm a bit different than you viewers.

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:35.560
That's why

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:36.680
I'm really interested!

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:37.720
about you humans,

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:38.900
I want to know about you,

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.120
and get along with you!

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:41.540
With that in mind,

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:43.320
I started this Youtube Channel!

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.560
Since I want you all to enjoy 
your time with me,

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:47.420
and doing livestreams,

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:49.320
or something futuristic like,

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.160
Virtual Reality!

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.780
I want to overcome challenges like that!

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:53.620
And,

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:54.720
maybe sometime,

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.180
I want to be in a commercial!

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.200
Doesn't famous youtuber

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.900
usually shows up in commercials?

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.120
I want to be famous like that!

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:05.980
If I can do that, I can connect to more of you viewers

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.000
As a personality it doesn't sounds wrong right?

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.460
I'll do what I can do,

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:11.820
if you want me to do something,

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.760
please make a request to me okay?

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.400
And, so as Ai Channel,

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.100
I wish for support from you all!

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:19.280
Virtual youtuber,

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:20.500
Kizuna Ai!

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:21.920
See you next time!
