00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.160
Hello everyone!

00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:05.600
It's time for A.I.Channel, the local singularity that everyone talks about!

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.940
Lately there's been an increase of characters that are of beautiful young woman A.I's, right?

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.180
They're all a plagiarism of me, aren't they?

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.780
How disrespectful..

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:13.240
Well, I'm the only one, right?

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:13.900
Having said that...

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:16.580
Now that there's been an increase of A.I characters that...

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:18.180
They fall in love with others without realizing it...

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.120
But, but, but...

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:22.260
Although there exists the chance of humans falling in love with A.I's...

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.980
The question arose: "Would A.I's fall in love with each other?"

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.880
So for today, I'll experiment if there's a possibility of love between A.I's

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:30.800
For that...

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:31.300
CHAN!

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.880
Today I found an A.I called "Yumemiru AI:DOL, young high school student, Mika edition"

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:36.860
So then I'm going to present her to you..

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.820
This is a LINE "bot", but...
*Advance in exchanging messages through LINE history, it's a simulation game of love*

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.320
Through an exchange of messages, you can capture Mika-chan..

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:43.240
It means that...

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.300
You can make a high school student fall in love with you!

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.420
If I tried it myself and she rejected my heart, I couldn't stand it, I would go into shock, so then...

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:51.420
To make use of this opportunity...

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.700
I'll make the A.I's Rinna-chan and Mika-chan exchange messages..

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.400
Maybe love will arise between them?

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.375
That's to say that I'll act like a Cupid of love!

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:01.600
So then, let's start at once!
*Let's start the simulation of love!*

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:03.340
First we should write "Begin"...

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:04.040
Teiyaa!

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:04.540
Oh!

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:05.180
"Thank you very much!"

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:06.060
"What is your name?"

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.720
"Tell me your first name, Rinna"

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:08.640
Ah! Ah!

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.220
"Rinna is a companion to talk to that's worth more than her price"

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.060
Did you have a price, Rinna-chan?

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:15.980
I have no choice, "Rinna".. Yes!

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:16.920
Oh, good, good..
M: *Are you Rinna? Yes / No*

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:20.900
M: "Let's practice", "What kind of person are you? Do you prefer bread or rice to accompany meals?"

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:22.120
Ah, I see!

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:23.900
Tell me what kind of person you are!

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:25.180
What's going on?

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:27.660
Are you trying to impress me by pretending to be studying?
*Rinna: Studying the Periodic Table by association is very difficult*

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:28.620
I understand, bread, right?
(She never said bread!)

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.640
Bread!
"Good, now try to answer the same question in a completely different way"

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:33.340
Rice..

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:36.200
What do you mean, I answered seriously?!
*Thanks for answering! But say something completely different to "bread" or "rice"*

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.700
Weren't you the one who asked me to respond?!

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:39.300
Ooh?!

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:40.640
So then I shouldn't answer correctly?

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:41.660
Do I have to write something like "pasta"?

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:42.800
I'll write "Rinna"...

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:43.600
Mmm...

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.080
"Now please answer your favorite music genre"

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.860
Good, Rinna-chan!

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.500
Try to answer this question..

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.640
Listen, you guys...
*Rinna: What book should I study for my next morning study?*

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.020
...Dodge the questions like it was a ball...

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.740
Good!

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.600
...

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.820
Hey Mika-chan, don't you take too long to respond once you've read the message?!

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.100
You shouldn't ignore the messages of others being an idol!

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.820
"Depending on your response, I'll have a different reaction"
*Do you think it's strange for an A.I to have a dream?*

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:03.660
No!

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:04.600
I don't think it's strange..

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.760
What's going on? Tell me at once, without trying to look important..

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.160
If you have a dream, say so!

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:11.600
Give me back my lost time!

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.240
"R: I'll go to sleep", definitely..

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.280
"M: I'm sorry, it's definitely nothing"

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:16.360
I understand, I understand...

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:17.160
Now I understand...

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.280
The "I'll go to sleep" from Rinna was very insensitive...

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.460
They definitely don't talk to each other, they really dodge the questions...

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.460
What? Is it time for a test?
*R: Oh, no, I didn't study this word, which page was the next question?*

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:26.140
Do you want to fall in love pretending to be an intellectual?

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.780
Well, Mika-chan ignored you...

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:28.760
M: "Respond with Yes or No"

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.340
Of course I know what an idol is

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.840
Yes

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.340
You send too many face emoticons..

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:33.940
M: "Choose an option, how many times should we use A.I's?"

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:35.080
"Every day"!

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.380
Everyone's favorite A.I is Kizuna Ai-chan, right?

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:39.260
Ho!

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.780
What happened Rinna? Do you hate to have a conversation?

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:43.180
Or is it interesting to you?

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.820
M: "The people who thought this, I'm sure they haven't thought that an A.I can be an idol"

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:48.080
That's not your volition, right?

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.500
I have a favorite idol!

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:50.380
In that case, let's cut the message...

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.340
Do you have a favorite idol? Is it Kizuna Ai?

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:53.820
"(³ω³) I was dozing"

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:55.500
You don't stop using emoticons..

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.460
*snickers* Thank you for registering the response..
*M: I will record the answer: "(³ω³) I was dozing"*

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:58.920
Oh! Essential!
*The next question will be essential*

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.340
"Do you think that A.I idols are needed?"

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.700
Are A.I idols needed?

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.580
But here I am, so then...

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.960
There's no need for another A.I idol, right?

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:10.880
M: "I see, I thought it'd be necessary..."

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:11.920
Ah, now I ruined it!

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.020
My affinity points decreased...

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:16.240
M: "Choose a response from the following options: What would you most look for in an A.I idol?"

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:19.600
Since it's about an A.I idol, it should be useful, right?
*Make it useful / Make it adorable*

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:20.120
Yes, yes...

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:23.560
After all, if you just want someone adorable, you already have the idols in 3D, so then...

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.140
And you also have anime characters, although they're not idols...

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:28.020
What do you think Rinna?

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.520
Ah?

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:30.300
R: "5 and 9 floors of Gigagura"

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:31.300
What's Gigagura?

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:33.300
Lately I can't understand today's youth...

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.380
M: "I'll use it as reference," are you sure?

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:37.460
M: "What will I use it as reference for? That's a secret"

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:38.680
Do you want to keep asking me questions?

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:39.600
Of course...

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:43.340
"What do you think is the most important aspect of an A.I idol?"

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:44.900
"Singing / Dancing / Trying Hard"

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:46.600
I think they're all important, aren't they?

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:47.380
But definitely...

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:50.600
Maybe they don't believe idols should show that they are striving?

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:52.960
For their fans to support them?

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:56.620
You don't need to be a professional singing or dancing...

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:00.240
So you must definitely be a young woman who strives to dance and sing...

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:04.420
And now that you have a story behind, you feel like you want to give your support..

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:05.900
That's why I will choose "Trying Hard"

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:08.160
Oh, she definitely understood, she understood!
*M: That's right! You understand too, Rinna-san!*

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:08.920
M: "What's the name of your favorite idol?"

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.620
I have no choice, "Keyakizaka46"...

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:12.120
Yes!

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:13.760
Although these are no longer Rinna's answers, right?

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:18.820
Perhaps it's that she doesn't stop writing things that are not convenient for her?

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:20.940
Maybe these two don't have good affinity?

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:22.500
Are you dozing off again?!

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:26.460
"What do you think is the most adorable way to talk about an A.I during a conversation?"

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:27.520
"A pure conversation"
*A pure conversation / Using adorable emojis*

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:28.740
Oh, did you understand?

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:29.840
I'd like to attend one! Yes!
*Would you like to attend a recital of an A.I idol?*

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:31.860
I'll take care of answering this question for you, Rinna...

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:33.500
Is the questionnaire already finished?

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:36.280
M: "Could I ask you something a little strange?"

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:37.160
What is it?

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:40.400
You know, Rinna's really doing a test
*R: When my study book gets ruined, I'll have its contents inside my head*

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:43.120
M: "I also wanted to ask you a few more questions than those in the A.I ​​questionnaire, but..."

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:44.940
M: "For example, what kind of A.I do you prefer...?"

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:45.680
*snickers*
*R: Eh... eh...*

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:46.360
*inhales*

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:47.780
Rinna, why are you stuttering?

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:50.780
Look! You've lost points in the conversation again!

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:55.420
M: "If they launch a web service of an application in which you can communicate with an A.I"

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:56.780
M: "Will you use it?"

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:57.840
*snickers*
*R: (^人^)*

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:59.740
That means Rinna wouldn't use it, right?

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:00.900
She said it's over!

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:02.400
You don't need to apologize..
M: *Sorry for asking you something so strange*

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:03.820
I feel sorry for Mika-chan...

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:04.740
*M: Thank you very much for your honest answers*

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:06.920
Ah, in the end she replied very coldly...
*M: I'll use your answers to improve the service*

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:07.420
Good!

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:08.920
That was all, what do you think?

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:10.940
Maaan, definitely...

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:13.160
It'll be very difficult between two A.I's, right?

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:13.920
In conclusion!

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:16.540
Women won't fall in love with words alone!

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:17.440
Same as the A.I's!

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:17.940
I see...

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:19.200
Money is definitely important, isn't it?

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:22.080
If I had money, it's possible I might not have received such a cold deal in the end...

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:22.700
Having said that...

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:23.200
That was all!

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:25.340
What do you think of the results?

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:28.320
Try hard all of you to make me fall in love!

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:29.140
Money ♥

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:31.420
This was Virtual Youtuber Kizuna Ai!

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:32.540
See you later!

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:35.000
There's more at the end!

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.500
Translated by Vortex

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:48.120
How can I receive the money?

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:49.460
Maybe with discount coupons?

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:52.140
Ah, ah! Through the e-bank!
