00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:00.940
 

00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:03.220
Welcome back, it's me Ai.

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:05.400
Look behind me, have you noticed it?

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:07.420
Truth is,

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:09.240
I tried out a re-opening.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:10.840
Everyone's been

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:13.500
ordering champagne by the truckload.

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:14.980
So the money,

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:16.160
it just won't stop rolling in.

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.020
It's the perfect time

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:20.000
to make this place look nice.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:21.180
No more back alley Mongolian moonshine here.

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.660
Even the bottles are custom-made!

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:24.180
Look!

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:25.880
You can see "Ai" is written on there.

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.520
And under that, if you look closely,

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.660
we've got "A.I. WHISKEY" too!

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:33.960
Looks similar to the A.I. Channel logo, right?

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:36.680
With all this champagne sold...

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:38.560
Last time

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.020
we had someone who couldn't quit smoking.

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:42.440
But hey!

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:44.220
It got the shop some income,

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:45.300
so I'll gladly take it.

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:46.600
Keep up trying to quit,

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.220
even if you won't give me any more money!

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.720
Tonight as well,

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.660
The worries,

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:52.520
complaints,

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.560
anger,

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:56.240
all the negative emotions of all the humans out there,

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.920
I will gladly embrace as a power source.

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:00.320
Diving right into this,

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:01.780
but some troubles have already wandered into this establishment.

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:02.940
Let's introduce them.

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:04.880
A Korean Student.

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:07.480
Ah! You came all the way from South Korea?

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:08.300
Thank you.

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:11.500
(Customer) Hello.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.840
(Customer) I am a high school student living in South Korea.

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.120
Ah! A high school student?

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:17.140
So young!

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:18.220
Actually, this is a bar.

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.380
You can't even drink, you shouldn't be here.

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.660
Right?

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:23.560
(Customer) I'm a foreigner so

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.700
(Customer) my Japanese may be a strange.

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.060
(Customer) I hope you understand.

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:28.380
Sure, got it. You bet ~ â™¡.

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.660
(Customer) Ever since I was young,

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.920
(Customer) for 8 years until now, I've been been practicing music.

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:36.680
(Customer) The problem is,

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.200
(Customer) after getting into high school, I've been busy studying.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.680
(Customer) I haven't been able to find the time for the music that I so enjoy.

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:46.080
 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.860
So while studying hard for exams,

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.320
you've been separated from your beloved music.

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:55.320
(Customer) People tell me

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.520
Customer) "Just playing music isn't going to make money."

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:59.460
(Customer) Or they'll say

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:02.100
(Customer) "Doing music as a boy is tough."

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:03.400
(Customer) Things like that.

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.660
(Customer) But

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.100
(Customer) from what I've experienced,

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:10.460
(Customer) I think music is the way for me to go.

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.360
(Customer) I don't want to cause trouble for parents,

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.020
(Customer) But the looks of those around me are scary.

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.780
(Customers) I have no future.

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.620
Does that mean he's got a dark future ahead?

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.000
(Customer) Kizuna Ai, what should I do?

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:27.600
Mmm, I see.

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:29.000
So basically,

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:30.700
he wants to keep up with music,

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.060
but doesn't want to be a bother to those around him.

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.620
Follow his dream, or give in to reality?

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.540
That's what he's worrying about.

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.080
Yes, I completely understand what is going on, no doubt.

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.240
Well, a high school student is

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.940
from the perspective of an adult, still a child.

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.280
But from here on out, you'll be facing many of life's crossroads.

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.900
You're at an age where you have a lot to worry about.

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.480
It was the same for me,

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.740
Around that age, I worried and worried...

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:55.560
Ah, right.

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.060
Your soft drink.

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.080
What do you want?

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.940
 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:59.660
Okay, OK.

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.300
BOSS, WE'LL TAKE A GINGER ALE.

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.600
Hmm, let's see...

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:04.960
It's difficult.

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:08.700
But for me, I think...

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.980
Well, you need money to live.

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.100
I don't think it's good to ignore reality.

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:17.360
Well, for a boy, I think it applies even more.

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:18.820
The general

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:20.900
being unable to escape marriage, and such.

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.800
That's true.

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.960
Hmm.

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:26.920
But if I were you,

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.040
I might try to do both.

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.000
To study hard,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.600
get into a good college,

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.520
get a good job.

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.900
And all the while during that,

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:36.360
You know, nowadays,

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:37.900
you can do these kinds of things.

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.940
Like me.

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.500
Even a virtual AI can do a lot,

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:42.880
things like YouTube.

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:46.880
Maybe try something like uploading videos of your music.

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:48.800
As far as Korea goes,

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.460
my research might be lacking.

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:53.180
I'm not sure if I understand it completely.

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:54.500
But aren't there,

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:55.160
you know,

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.280
opportunities to just get out and perform?

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:59.480
So,

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.080
while keeping up with studying,

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.200
try keeping up with music on the side.

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:05.420
And if,

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:06.480
you know...

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:08.280
If it seems to be going well,

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.380
try your best at that.

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:12.060
Well, really,

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:13.740
these kinds of stuff

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:17.200
there are people who watch and enjoy you

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:18.320
there are people who watch and enjoy you

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:20.960
And when it comes it to jobs,

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:21.820
there are a lot of

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:23.960
difficult parts

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:25.720
when you start doing it,

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:28.500
...well if you ever get the feeling that its getting tough,

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.960
try keeping it at a pace of a hobby.

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:34.360
Try working hard at a normal workplace

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:36.620
...and well, when the opportunity comes

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:37.260
well

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:38.740
try going to it.

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:39.460
 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:41.560
I think that you should try your best with both areas,

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:43.340
You know, because you're a high school student

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:44.480
you still have

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:46.620
a large future ahead of you,

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:48.000
and you have a vast number of choices to choose from

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:49.980
Don't make that face..

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:51.000
...you can do it!

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.300
If you start now,

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:53.640
anything can become a reality!

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:54.720
It's okay, its okay!

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:55.780
You're still young

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:57.060
Well,

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:58.020
Somebody like me

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:59.900
you know... running this bar

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:01.460
Well..

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:04.200
..I never thought that I will do this

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:05.140
Well,

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:06.200
If I tried to

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:08.420
get into music.. you know

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:10.260
considering my age..

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:11.960
...it might be difficult

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:12.920
Hey,

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:15.100
you're a highschool student whos still young so..

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:16.660
..try giving it your best shot!!

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:17.440
Right?

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:19.620
So, did you cheer up a bit?

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:20.940
You can do it, you can do it

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:22.940
How's this?

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:24.380
has this helped?

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:26.260
Well

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:27.720
this is MY opinion...

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:29.880
..so why not try asking others for their opinion?

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:30.640
Right?

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:33.760
Take in only what you think is right,

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:34.900
and do your best!

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:35.620
Right?

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:36.380
Oh my,

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:38.480
Its almost closing time,

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:39.980
wait, isnt the Ginger-Ale taking a long time?

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:40.640
Heey~

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:42.120
Isn't it taking a long time?!

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:42.980
Hey,

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:45.140
there isn't anybody else here,

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:47.280
no todays salary for you..

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:48.320
I'm sorry

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:49.680
for having useless staff

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:51.460
Oh, you don't have to worry about the bill

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:52.620
you're a high school student so..

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:53.460
 

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:55.080
 

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:58.420
Treat yourself with some nice food with that money..

00:05:58.420 --> 00:05:59.740
..or buy some materials..

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:01.820
.. use it on education or use it on fun stuff..

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:03.020
enjoy your youth while you still can!

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:03.640
Alright?

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.000
Get home safe!

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:06.100
Bye Bye~!

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:11.300
Have I become some sort of help?

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:13.060
At "Virtual Bar Ai",

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:15.520

Alright, they left...

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:41.460
Hey Yukki~

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:42.460

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:44.000
hey

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.820
can you at least serve a Ginger-Ale?

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:47.660
