00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.160
Hi there, Virtual YouTuber, Kizuna Ai here!

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:06.380
well, I barely survived from last video and came back

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:08.700
after that I talked with the aliens

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:09.940
I had to use a lot of hand gestures and

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:11.940
had a conversation with them

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.880
and they sent me back to Earth!

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.220
There is no more messing around from now on! YAA

00:00:18.225 --> 00:00:21.635
After 3 days, This is the real Guinness Challenge!

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:22.900
Today is the last one!

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.060
well, I'm sorry to you guys but..

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:28.380
I've been messing around till this video, I'm sorry!

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.160
I'm so sorry

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.740
Today is the last day, I will try my best and

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:36.440
challenge a Guinness Record

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.295
well, as the judge can't come here

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.440
It's a shame

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.305
However,

00:00:41.305 --> 00:00:44.280
if I truly break the record,  I will

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.820
apply for the real Guinness record!

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:48.060
YAAAAAAAY

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:51.680
I wanna be in the Guinness record book! As the first AI

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.560
I wanna be just a little...

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.460
more popular globally

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.540
so without further ado, let's go!

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.280
The first thing I'm gonna challenge today is this!

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.620
The record for the longest possible scream!

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:03.420
it is

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.360
It's basically a record where you just scream as long as you can

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.560
The Guinness record for this is 43.56 seconds

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.500
The record holder for this is a Borussia Dortmund supporter,
a german football team,

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.740
took the title

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.860
I will break his record! But first!

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.620
If I just shout out normally, It would not be interesting

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:27.440
I will be shouting out my favourite line from Nico Yazawa "Nico Nico Nii"

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.000
with this

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.000
I will break the record with 49-50 seconds!

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.340
NICO NICO

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:42.680
NIIIIIIIIIIIIII

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:47.440
This...

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.140
is because the line was bad

00:01:49.455 --> 00:01:52.075
If you don't start counting from the first "Ni", right?

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.120
I'm just

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.260
I'm gonna do this seriously, now I'll just use "a"

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:12.740
AHHHHHH

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.920
*14.14seconds*

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.780
43.56 seconds....

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:20.840
seriously?

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.300
well, I guess you human beings are not so bad after all

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.380
Ok, let's move on then! The next is......This!

00:02:27.425 --> 00:02:30.765
A record using your leg to hit your head!

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.400
This record is how many times you can kick your head with your legs in 1 min.

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:36.940
Like this?

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.355
It's not gonna count if you are not standing up

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.700
Also, you have to start with your legs on the ground

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.800
after every single kick, your legs have to be  back on the ground

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.840
The Guinness record for this record is 134 times

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:51.960
by some guy from Nepal

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.140
I will break that record right now!

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:55.960
Challenge start!

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:05.560
My legs are cramping up...

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.620
This is impossible... it's way too hard

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:19.260
This is impossible! Has it not been a minute yet?

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:20.360
This...really

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.220
I still haven't hit my head

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.820
my head once...

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.660
KAN KAN KAAAAAAN

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.300
Yes! That's it! Everything is over!

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:34.900
even though I'm an AI, my leg still cramped

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.300
and that concludes the third day

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.140
of these Guinness record challenging videos!

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:42.140
Did everyone enjoy it?

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:43.840
Well as I thought,

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.420
These Guinness records totally live up to my expectations

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.380
It's a record among all human beings!

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:51.360
maybe I was too naive

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:55.680
That's it! I'll  think of a Guinness record I can get!

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.095
I am!

00:03:57.095 --> 00:04:00.305
An AI YouTuber who has uploaded the most video on YouTube!

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:03.980
Isn't that correct? Can this be a record in the Guinness record?

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:06.180
Can't you put me in? Can't you?

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.120
Is it impossible if I'm not a human?

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.520
Judges! Are you watching!?

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:14.780
Please tell me! Please! Like this!

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:18.440
I've tried my hardest in this white dimension!

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:19.740
Please!

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:23.440
Judges! Are you watching? Are you watching? Please!

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.280
People from the Guiness world records! Please!

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:27.480
Guinness Lords!

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.000
Please put me on the Guinness record... I don't care how but

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.680
P L E A S E....

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:36.980
More at the end! Don't end the video!

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:44.900
