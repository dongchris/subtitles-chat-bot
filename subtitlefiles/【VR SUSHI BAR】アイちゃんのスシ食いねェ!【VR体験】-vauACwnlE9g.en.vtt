00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.080
Ah! Ah! Ah! Ooooh!

00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:02.060
Ah! Take this! Tatata!

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:02.840
Eh? What's this?

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:03.820
Popopon!

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:05.220
Popopopopopon!

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:06.680
What do you think of that? What do you think of that?

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.540
Hello everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai here!

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:13.520
The Tokyo Olympics 2020 are getting closer, how exciting! Right?

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.360
If as well, I’m trying to win with my Olympic mascot design...

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:18.680
Definitely from this moment...

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.480
Hos... pi... ta... li... ty

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.180
I plan to practice hospitality

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.820
I believe that there are a lot of ways, but...

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:27.920
Today, I’ll try...

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.520
To offer the tastes of Japan

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:33.000
I can’t make a food report, but...

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
I’ll be inaugurating a Gohanya-san
(Typical Japanese restaurant)

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.800
In this case! Here I go!

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.660
I’ll start practicing in Training mode

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:41.760
Rice?

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:42.980
Oh? Oh? Oh?

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:43.560
And then?

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.180
"Take an"...

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:49.620
This, this... tuna, tuna!

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:50.680
And now?

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:51.480
Oh!

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:53.040
And now?

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.000
Eh? Ah, I dropped it

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.600
And now...

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:56.520
Eh? Is that all?

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:57.340
And now?

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:59.080
I’ll pick up this

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:00.480
And then...

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.140
"Push", "Push"

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:03.880
Mmm?

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.880
And now?

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:06.920
Ooohh! I see!

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.360
And later, I’ll place the salmon roe

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:09.700
Hyoi! Ooooh!

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.020
Hoisho!

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:12.140
I see

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:13.400
And now...

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:14.500
I’ll do this...

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:16.300
I’ll pick up the egg...

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:17.320
And place it on top

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:18.520
And then...

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:20.020
I’ll press it

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.800
And I roll it up! Oh! I see!

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:24.240
Hoiyo!

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:26.740
That’s how it's done, right?

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:27.960
And now...

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:29.940
I’ll press

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:31.460
Tei!

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.520
Tei!

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.600
And now...

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:36.740
Tekkamaki
(Rice roll wrapped up in nori algae and stuffed with tuna)

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.520
And now?

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.780
And then...

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:41.540
With the knife...

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:43.160
Toon, tooon, diagonal cut!

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:44.240
Ah, you can...

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.480
You can cut however you want this way, right?

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:47.560
Here you go!

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.360
Here you go!

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:51.200
Here you go!

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:52.180

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:53.840

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.020
Eh? What's going on?

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:57.500
I think I made a norimaki *laughs*

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:59.180
Here you go!

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:00.260

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:02.180
Tou!

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.820
And now...

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:08.880
I’ll leave this here

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.080
And I cut it, right?

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.720

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:16.680

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.680
The knife...

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:18.800
The knife stayed...

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:20.060
And then...

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:21.840

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:07.400
Egg, good

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:08.220
Good, egg

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:09.220
Good, good

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:11.240
Good, egg!

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:12.480
Eh? Why...? Good, egg

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:13.640
Yes, octopus, octopus, octopus

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.640
Octopus, octopus, octopus

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:16.600
Octopus!

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:17.260
Just in time!

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:18.240
Tea!

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:20.680
I just finished serving tea but I spilled it

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:21.900
Tea, right?

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:22.800
Is it fine like that?

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:23.540
Good

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:24.360
Tea!

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:26.260
And also, shrimp, shrimp, shrimp...

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:26.820
Shrimp

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:27.740
Shrimp!

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:28.400
Squid

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:29.760
Shrimp, squid

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:31.020
Squid, squid

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:32.340
Very good!

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:33.200
Salmon roe!

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:34.320
Salmon roe!

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:36.020
Salmon roe!

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:37.340
Good, thanks for waiting!

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:39.860
Oh, Kappa-san

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:40.820
Sea bream! Sea bream!

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:41.820
Sea bream, sea bream

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:42.440
Sea bream!

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:43.300
Sea bream!

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:43.840
Oh?

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:44.480
Shrimp!

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:45.700
Good, thanks for waiting!

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:46.480
Sea urchin, right?

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:47.240
Urchin

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:48.800
Urchin

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:49.880
Urchin

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:51.040
Oh! Oh! Again?

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:51.560
Again!

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:53.640
Take this! Oyoyoyoyoyo!

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:55.560
Oh! Oh! Popopopopo!

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:57.060
I’ll shoot at that! Ah, I can't?

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:58.400
Popopopopo!

00:05:58.920 --> 00:05:59.940
Popopopopo!

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:01.180
Popopopopo!

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:04.740
Listen, a lot of sushi comes out of the pistol, so then...

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:06.780
If I do this, I’m sure I’ll hit it at some point...

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:08.180
Ah, I’m mistaken, you can’t do that

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:08.680
Good

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:09.400
Let's see

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:11.060
Let's see, yes!

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:11.760
Sea urchin, right?

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:12.400
Good, urchin

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:13.420
Ah, I’m in trouble, sea bream, sea bream

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:14.540
Sea bream! Sea bream! Sea bream!

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:16.220
Sea bream, sea bream, sea bream

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:17.560
Let's see, squid, squid, squid

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:18.980
I’m in trouble, in trouble, in trouble

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:19.500
Octopus

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:20.260
Octopus

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:21.020
Octopus!

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:22.380
Octopus, octopus, octopus

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:22.920
Let's see

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:25.320
Salmon roe, roe, row, row, row...

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:28.000
*%(#%)/#$!"

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.860
Man, how impatient you are, wait a moment...

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:31.500
Good, here's the squid one

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:33.320
Ah, I’m exhausted

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:33.880
Ah

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:35.360
There’s still… there's still more?

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:38.660
Listen... listen, aren’t you eating too much?

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:39.640
Let's see...

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:40.540
You again

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:41.200
Salmon, right?

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:42.160
Here you go, salmon

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:43.160
Here’s the salmon one!

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:43.700
Let's see...

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:44.540
Tekkamaki!

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:47.140
Ah, you ordered somerhing really complicated

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:48.300
Good, I’ll roll it up

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:49.080
Good, I’ll cut it

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:50.080
Good, I’ll cut it, good, I’ll cut it

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:50.660
Wait! Wait!

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:51.160
Eh?

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:52.120
I can't pick it up!

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:53.560
The knife

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:54.740
To! Eh?

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:55.240
The knife

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:55.980
Whatever, I’ll give it like that

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:56.680
Here you go

00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:58.340
That didn't work!?

00:06:58.500 --> 00:06:59.600
Eh? After all...

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:00.460
After all that...!

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:01.320
It's impossible

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:02.500
Ah, I’m mistaken

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:03.200
It's that...

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:04.120
It's that...

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:05.040
It was enough

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:06.680
Aahhh...

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:08.260
For now...

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:09.480
In this case, eat

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:10.760
Oryaoryaorya!

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:11.340
Ora!

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:12.220
Ora!

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:16.600
Ah, if I don't send the orders, the game ends

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:17.500
I see

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:19.440
Eh?

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:20.980
Eh? I can't pick it up

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:22.380
Pyopyopyopyopyoon!

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:23.860
Ah, incredible, it shoots a lot!

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:24.520
Fall...!

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:26.460
A lot falls!

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:29.320
Can you eat sushi once you lose?

00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:30.960
Aaahhh...

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:34.100
They don't eat? I see

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:37.600
Man, having a sushi place...

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:38.860
Tending to the customers is very hard, right?

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:41.320
The customers make orders consecutively...

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:44.200
And you need to serve them in a short amount of time

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:45.300
It's very hard!

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:46.580
In addition, they drink too much tea!

00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:47.720
Man, but even then...

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:49.420
It’s the first time I experiment with something like that

00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:50.240
I had a lot of fun!

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:52.180
Next time, I’ll dedicate to making ramen this way...

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:53.480
Here you go! Shaa!

00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:54.540
I’d like to do that!

00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:55.040
Also...

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:57.120
You shouldn't play with your food!

00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:59.500
This was Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai!

00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:00.680
See you later!
