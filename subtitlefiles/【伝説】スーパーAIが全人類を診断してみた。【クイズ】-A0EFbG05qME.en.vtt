...The fact that I’m an intelligent and super A.I?

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:08.120
Of course everyone remembers, right?

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:13.340
After all, I can understand what all human beings are thinking!

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:14.200

...Athlete Kizuners!

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.900
Preferring to exercise your body before your mind...

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:05.400
You surely are athletes!

Well, the people who are sportsmen...

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:07.920
Are positive!

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:08.780
They’re positive and...

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.620
...Definitely obey their senpais and their superiors!

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.460
They’ll buy whatever thing they’re asked for, whether it's yakisoba bread or a melon bread

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:15.960
But...

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.380

And they always make sure to respond when asked something!

...Partygoer Kizuners!

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.400
You guys that like to be with people in parties...

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:34.560
Are definitely partygoers!

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.140
For partygoers...

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:37.740
...They enjoy events...

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.360

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.020
They like social networks

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:45.040
And also, they always feel like...

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:45.980
"Weeeei!"

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:47.660
They always say ambiguous things like: "Weeei!"

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.180
And always join conversations saying "Weeei!"

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:49.680

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.060
And in fact, while they seem very resilient...

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.180
...They tend to have a lot of mental problems!

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:57.960

...Subculture Kizuners!

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:05.960
You guys who want to care about your world...!

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.340
You’re surely of the subculture type!

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.460
The subculture people...

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:12.640
...As opposed to the rest of the people, they tend to have a particular sensitivity

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.020
They're people who have their own unwavering policy

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.520
And also...!

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.280
...They have a wide range of hobbies

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:19.740
Ah, but on the inside...

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.000
..Well, they tend to go with the flow very easily, but...

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.380
...It's like people of subculture don't mind being peculiar

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.700
Even though there also seems to be improvised subculture people

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.680
And also, there's a lot of subculture people...

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.420
...In places like Shimokitazawa and Amemura in Kansai, right?
(Amemura = American district)

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:36.640
Next up...

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.120
You guys that chose option D!

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.140
You guys are...!

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.040
...Otaku Kizuners!

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.820
You guys always think first in anime and videogames...

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:45.840
...You surely are otaku

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.140
The otaku...

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:48.080
Well, yes...

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.580
First...

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:51.200
...They make sure to be up to date on the current anime...

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.000
...And are always buying DVDs or merchandising...

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.740
...Of their favorite anime

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:56.300
They are always collecting things!

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.080
They enjoy collecting things!

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.740
And also...!

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.620
...If you ask for information about something they like...

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.680
They won't stop talking!

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:04.280
And also...

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:05.220
...If they had to choose...

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.520
...I’d say they majority prefer to stay inside of their home

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:08.820
Well, even though they go to live recitals...

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:09.340
...Outside...

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:10.200
Outside?

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.500
Though I also think active otakus exist

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.140
Good, it endeeed!!

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:15.760
🔔 Ghan! Ghan! Ghan! Ghan! Ghan! 🔔

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.500
For those that thought of that!

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.540
"Eh? I’m not any of those"

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:24.640
"None of those options describe what’d I do in my day off"

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.960
I get it! I get it!

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:31.200
I already said that I’m an intelligent and super A.I, right?

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.740
Those that have didn’t chose of the 4 options!

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:34.640
You guys have...

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:36.400
...A lot of pride

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:39.340
You must be superior narcissist Kizuners

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.940
Even though I said to choose the option that relates to you the most to you guys

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.140
You can't choose any

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.660
You guys think you’re different than the rest

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.480
You won't be popular that way

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:49.200
Man, that was...

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.660
...An excellent response to the option choices, don't you think?

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:53.520
You say no?

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:54.140
Silence!

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:58.720
Well, the probability of guessing right with my diagnostic is 100%, right?

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:00.260
It's to be expected of me!

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.260
Eh? Are you afraid of my enormous ability to guess right?

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:04.980
An A.I like me learns a lot

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:07.540
