00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.480
Hello everyone! Virtual Youtuber Kizuna Ai here!

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:03.380
In this occasion...

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:07.180
I plan to continue with the second part of the Guessing Game!

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.900
Starting from now, I'll do an imitation of something...

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.940
So then try to guess what it is, yes?

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:13.660
Man...

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:16.460
Now that you synchronize your thoughts with mine...

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:17.260
You can guess it, right?

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:18.760
In that case, let's start at once!

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.760
Jaka, jaka, jakaa, JAN!

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:22.220
Ah, I see..

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:24.460
Won't this be really easy?

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:26.160
Those that can't guess it...

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.680
Can only eat white rice!

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.580
In that case, I'll start Ai-chan's guess!

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:31.160
Ah!

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:32.040
Aa-aah!

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:34.180
Hey you, don't forget the Karashi mustard!

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:34.680
The Karashi mustard!

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:35.320
Rrghn..

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:36.320
You didn't mix it enough!

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.380
You need to blow harder!

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:42.440
If you don't mix it better, it won't be viscous enough!

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:43.800
I'm dizzy..

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:45.020
No! Mix it!

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.780
Aaaah!

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:46.740
You plan to flip me?

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:47.460
Isn't that too soon?

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:48.020
That burns!

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:49.440
You need to wait until I cool down a bit more!

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.000
That's all!

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:51.820
It's over!

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.060
*out of breath* Ghan, ghan, ghan...

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.920
Man, everyone...

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.180
After all the effort I did to move my body that way...

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.980
You guessed it, right?

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:00.160
In that case, the time for thinking starts!

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.940
Gueeeesss... Guess...

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.020
Gueeeessss...

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.740
It's over!

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:07.180
Ghan, ghan, ghaaaan!

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:09.840
Thinking about this song was very difficult!

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.820
In this case, the correct answer is...

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:13.960
Natto!
(Fermented soybeans)

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:15.060
This was really easy...

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.260
After all I talked about Karashi mustard...

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:17.460
the viscosity...

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:18.240
And of mixing it...

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.820
I gave you a lot of clues, right?

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:21.700
Of course you've been able to guess, right?

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.400
In that case, let's continue with the next one!

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.160
Jaka, jaka, jakaa, JAN!

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:26.020
Oooh!

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.780
I see..

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.160
This is... well...

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.740
Good, good, good!

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:29.440
I can do it!

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.240
Watch closely!

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.740
Ai-chan's guess begins!

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:35.040
The form is something like this..

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:35.860
Good, come here!

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.140
I can receive any kind of ball!

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:38.740
Oooh!

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:40.260
Ah, please, make sure you get it in here...

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:41.480
Get it down here!

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:42.580
Don't hit me anywhere else!

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:43.440
That hurts! That hurts!

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:44.140
Oh! Good job!

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:44.760
Goooal!

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:45.980
Oh! Yaaaaay!

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.420
Good job, today was a great match..

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:49.540
Good, that is all!

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:50.980
Ghan, ghan, ghaaaaan!

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.080
Of course you've been able to guess, right?

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.620
In that case, let's start thinking time!

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.440
♪ Guesses ♪

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.400

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:04.020
It's over!

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.140
The correct answer is...!

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.560
A soccer goal!

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.260
There was definitely no other choice once I told you what the shape was, right?

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:11.320
You were able to guess, right?

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:12.380
Perhaps you weren't able to guess?

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:13.620
You're a big dummy!

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.440
Good, let's continue with the next one!

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.120
Jaka, jaka, jakaa, JAN!

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:18.100
Oooh!

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:19.300
How specific..

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:20.740
This is something...

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:25.080
I think if you don't have an IQ of more than 250, you won't be able to guess

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.620
This means that if you can guess it!

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:27.920
It's because you have an IQ of 250!

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.780
In this case, Ai-chan's guess will begin!

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.560
Why they are all being used and no one uses me?

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:36.440
I'm..

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:37.620
Right here!

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:38.300
Over here!

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:39.120
Ah, over there...

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.900
It's not over there, it's over here

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:40.480
Hey, hey, hey...

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:40.980
Let's go

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.740
My color is pleasing to the eye

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:43.760
I'm the color of nature!

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:44.420
Hey, hey, hey!

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:45.620
Use me too!

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.480
Look at all that's left of ink!

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.480
Only I have the full tank

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:50.640
You haven't used me once

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:51.380
Hello?

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:52.880
Ah! You think of throwing it while I'm here?

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:54.180
I'm still here!

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.820
Do you plan to sleep?

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:55.520
Hey you!

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:56.400
I'll curse you!

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.860
I'll make sure to curse you!

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:59.260
That's all!

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.320
Were you able to guess?

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.960
In that case, let's start with thinking time!

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.160

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.760

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:10.880

Were you able to guess?

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:13.260
The correct answer is...!

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.340
A green pen from a pen canister of 4 colors!

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:16.920
Do you guys use the color green?

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.740
It's the same color...

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:19.380
As my eyes..

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:20.880
Make sure to use it!

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:21.800
Well, man...

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.120
You know, I know it can be transmitted this way but..

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.740
I know everyone loves me, right?

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:29.480
And that's why you've synchronized your thoughts with mine, right?

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:30.420
In this case...

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:31.800
Well, you know...

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:35.220
Those who haven't been able to guess, be sure to synchronize with me, yes?

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:38.820
This was Virtual Youtuber Kizuna Ai! See you later!
