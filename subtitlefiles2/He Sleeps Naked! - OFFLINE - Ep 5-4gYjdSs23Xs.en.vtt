Bing!

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:07.420
What a flight. I'm so tired.

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:11.080
-Goodnight

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:12.890
-Night. See you guys in the morning

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.340
Nice room

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:24.290
Wait a minute

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.430
What's up?

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.430
There's only one bed

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:30.880
So? It's like a king-sized. We'll share.

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.180
No we were supposed to get two beds. I'm gonna go to the front desk.

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:34.909
Chris

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:41.599
Please I'm super tired. Okay. I don't feel like switching rooms right now. Okay, you and I are friends and adults

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.389
Can we just share a bed?

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.360
Yeah, of course.

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:48.470
Thank you

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:50.338
Yeah, wait, wait wait.

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:51.120
Yeah?

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:52.120
What are you doing?

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:53.900
I like to sleep in my underwear.

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.260
Yeah, so do I, but we're sharing the bed. So keep your shorts on

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.120
What's the difference between my shorts and my underwear?

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:01.220
Phil it is one more layer of fabric

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.809
between me and

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.809
your stuff

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:07.700
You're sounding a little homophobic.

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.180
No. No it is not about that. I just don't want to accidentally touch

00:01:13.829 --> 00:01:14.960
You.

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.519
Well, whatever you touch is going to be the same whether I'm in my shorts or my underwear

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.300
So get over it

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.480
[Knocking]

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:27.540
No.

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.140
How did you know what I was gonna ask?

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:31.729
Look Chris. I travelled the world eight years with Phil, okay?

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:33.729
I know he moves around in his sleep

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.710
A lot

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.040
Please. I can't.

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:45.280
What's up?

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.480
I...wanted to see if you'd like to switch rooms with me.

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:52.760
I'm kind of already into my evening routine, so

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.800
I'd prefer not to.

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.900
Come on Taylor feels. Phil's.. He's being weird

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:59.080
Chris

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.040
All of us have to share a bed with Phil at one point

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.320
Get over it

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:05.960
[ping]

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.780
Oooh, my bath salts are ready. Gotta go. Bye!

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.780
Hmm. See Chris. It's not so bad right.

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:16.760
Yeah, it's not so bad.

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.920
I mean, you wouldn't even be able to tell if I were naked

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.560
Yeah... night Phil

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:31.820
[snoring]

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:47.759
Phil. Phil you're on my side. Phil.

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:54.900
Phil

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:57.500
Phil

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:59.240
Phil!

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.140
Phil?

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.560
What?! I'm trying to sleep.

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:07.320
[Chris scream]

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.640
I- I forgot my uh, my my car

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.880
You want some ice?

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:16.360
Wait, wait what?

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.440
That's too much. [laughing]

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:21.920
Yeah?

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.140
I don't like that one. Yeah?

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.040
Wait, wait what ?

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.700
[more laughter]

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:32.989
It's- what are my Korean Wong FU tendency?

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:35.660
I know he moves around a lot in his sleep

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:39.330
[shudders]

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.592
Sorry. You look great Taylor.

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.340
This is how I normally look

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.200
[even more laughter]

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:53.540
[laughs] Sorry. Just thinking of the edit already.

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:54.980
What?

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:56.220
[Wail]

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:59.900

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:03.880
Hey everyone hope you guys- stop looking at me

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:06.349
Sorry. Haha. It's making me very uncomfortable.

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:07.768

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:10.720

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.180
