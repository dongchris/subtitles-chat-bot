00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:10.560
Chris: Hey

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:12.900
Is anyone sitting here?

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:15.800
Karen: O-oh, uh... no

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:16.960
Uh, go ahead

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:34.280
*burps*

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:35.420
*laughter*

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:36.100
Chris: Oh

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:37.500
Excuse me

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:40.220
Chris: Excuse me!

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:42.920
Chris: EXCUSE ME!

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.080
Hey... Can you watch my stuff?

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:47.860
I have to go to the bathroom

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.660
Karen: Oh yea, sure! I'll watch...

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:53.400
...your stuff

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:55.720
Chris: Thanks! W-what's your name?

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.960
Karen: Karen

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:58.140
Chris: Chris

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:00.940
Karen: Chrissss...

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:03.740
Chris' stuff...

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:06.260
Chris' stuff

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.400
Bottle, hat, journal, tablet, laptop, camera, phone!?

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:15.480
That's a lot to keep track of...

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.620
...and everything is so expensive!

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.340
The total cost is at least...

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.980
A LOT OF MONEY!

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.000
I don't even have a checking account.

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:25.920
This is too much responsibility.

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.660
*clock ticking*

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:31.580
Karen: What's taking him so long?

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.680
I thought he was only going number 1

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.220
If he's taking a dump, then why didn't he take his phone?

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.060
Heh, that's so Chris

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:45.420
Oh no!

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.060
I need to go to the restroom, too.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.140
Should I ask a stranger to watch...

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:52.640
...my stuff?

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.380
But that means they would have to watch my stuff and the stuff I'm watching for Chris

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:58.880
What if that stranger has to pee too?

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.060
Then, they need to find a stranger to watch their stuff, the stuff they're watching for a stranger

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.580
and the stuff that stranger is watching for Chris.

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.420
Uhhh, I don't think I can hold much longer.

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.860
Too sleepy!

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.980
Too far!

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:20.240
Too shady!

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:23.060
I can't trust anyone!

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.700
*phone buzzes*

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.580
Karen: ALWAYS?!

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:29.940
But it's not my phone.

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:31.320
Wait-

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:34.560
What if someone is in danger?

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:37.940
Oh my god, I killed someone.

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:40.940
*phone buzzes again*

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.720
Karen: Hi, uh, Chris' phone

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:43.640
Who's this?

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.880
Caller: Uuhhh, this is Chris' girlfriend...

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:48.080
Who the hell are you?!

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:49.060
Hold on-

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:50.420
Are you Janice?

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.660
Because he keeps talking about a Janice and I have no idea who that is

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:56.240
*music builds as caller fades away to sound of people drinking water*

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:57.440
Karen: I have to pee

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:58.920
Chris: Hey

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:00.220
Chris: My stuff

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.940
Karen: Thank god, I have to go to restroom so..

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.340
Off-screen person: No, no, no! Wait!

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.320
Another Chris: Karen, stop!

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.160
Karen: What the fu-

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.660
Chris: Karen

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.080
Chris: Don't listen to anything this man says

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.560
Karen: Who are you?

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:18.580
The other Chris: I'm Chris!

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:19.540
He's an imposter!

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:21.660
Chris: I'm Chris!

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:24.420
I asked this man to watch my stuff, and he stole everything from me

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:25.940
Including my identity!

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:27.180
The other Chris: Trust me...

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.640
Both Chrises: I'm Chris; These are my things

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:31.860
Both Chrises: Stop it, you're just copying my-
The other Chris: sandwiches

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.520
The other Chris: Ah-ha!

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.660
Karen: Quiet!

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:39.500
Karen: So, the real Chris would know about his phone, right?

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:40.480
Chris: mhm

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:42.040
Karen: So what's the passcode?

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:43.140
The other Chris: 1-2-3-4

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:50.500
Chris: That is the most common passcode in the world, okay?

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.580
So...

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:52.440
Chris: Look it up

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:53.720
*phone buzzes*

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:56.760
Chris' Girlfriend: Chris!

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:59.260
There you are!

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:04.940
Chris' Girlfriend: What the hel-

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:05.440
Chris: Hello?

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:08.240
Hello?

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.100
So, can you watch my stuff?

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:14.600
Karen: No!

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.980
Chris: Um, I really have to use the bathroom though

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.060
[BTS]
Anyway, Leenda's here

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.220
Yaaaay!
Hi!

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:28.940
Chris is back

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:31.520
Chris' back on Wong Fu's channel...

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:33.380
...being

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:35.100
Off-screen person: He just did it!

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:35.900
*laughter*

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:38.280
Hey, this is Julie

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:45.000
Ummm, and Julie is playing the friend in this short
