00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.660
Is Diane here!?

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:24.400
- No, she just left.

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:25.620
- AH! Where did she go?!

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:26.720
The airport.

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:28.020
She's taking the job in Paris.

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:32.140
Within one week, she packed up her entire life here -
 without telling any of your mutual friends by the way,

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:34.300
- and now she's moving to France (shrug)

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.160
She just got in the cab.

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.840
I LOVE HER, Okay? I-I realized that I LOVE her.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.760
- Maybe if you run after her you can still catch her at the terminal, and profess you love to her,

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.320
Before she flies away, and then you'll never be able to communicate with her ever again.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.560
- I'll never make it!

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:51.060
- Run.

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:53.900
Run Joe.

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.260
Can't wait to see what happens.

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:21.160
(RUNNING IS SO MUCH EFFORT)

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.380
I'm so sorry, Joe.

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.900
[Heavy breathing]

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.580
- DI!

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:48.740
- Excuse me?

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.000
- Uh, Di! D- Diana!

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:52.480
- Joe!

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.400
Oh my god, are you okay?

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:55.800
- No. I, uh, yes!

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.400
I love you, Diana!

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.340
- [Sighs in relief] I l love you too, Joe!

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:06.180
Don't go to Paris.

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.520
You can't leave me.

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:09.800
- Joe, I wanna believe you

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:15.980
If only there were some, extraordinary feat, you could perform to prove you PASSIONATE devotion to me,

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:17.180
Your one true love!

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.760
Um, Yeah, yeah, I just ran 17 blocks, non-stop, to try and find you uh- um

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.453
I was gonna try and catch you at the airport.

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:26.740
- Oh, that's so romantic!

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:28.260
- Yeah, I really-

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.680
So, where- Where are you, exactly?

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:38.080
- W-well uh, well I'm not at the airport, uhm, I realized I can just call you,

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:39.140
You know, save the trouble

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.180
- Save the trouble?

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.580
Heh, running, to find me at the airport to stop me from moving, to another CONTINENT,

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.500
because you "LOVE" me, is TROUBLE?!

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:51.580
- N-no, hah, NO it's not, um

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.240
- Au. re. voir. Joe. AU REVOIR!

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.120
- N-no! D-d-don't hang up, DON'T HANG UP

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:58.280
[Screams in frustration]

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:04.320
- Aw, come ON
