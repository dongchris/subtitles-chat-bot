00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Hi~ Are you guys doing well?

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.080
It's finally time to spend some time with Ai-chan!

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:12.340
Today, Big Sister Ai is going to casually introduce the tale of Momotaro to you guys!

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:14.260
Big Sister Ai's rendition of Momotaro's tale!

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:16.620
And here we go~

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:22.440
A long, long time ago, there lived an old couple at a faraway place.

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:24.360
They were living off a pension.

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.740
When the old man made a trip to the mountains...

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:29.740
The old woman...

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.660
Went to the river to do the laundry.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.800
Old Woman: Oh, ahh... Here we go...

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.280
Oh boy, does my hip hurt...

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.380
And we don't have enough money every month...

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:49.080
I wonder if a delicious-looking peach or something will flow down the river...

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:52.800
Splash... Splash...

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.080
Oh, goody! A peach! Here we go...

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.920
I bet this can feed me and the old man at home for a whole month!

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.660
Thus, the old woman took the peach that flowed down the river back home with her.

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.380
Old man! Look here at this peach!

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.280
Old Man: Ooooh, it sure looks like a wonderful peach.

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.020
Old Woman: Let's split it into two immediately... Hiyaah!

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.540
Momotaro: Burst out!

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.760
Grandpa, Grandma... I know...

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.540
The two of you are being troubled by ogres, right?

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.200
I'll deal with the ogres for you in a jiffy, so I'll help myself to all your pension funds, alright?

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.940
And thus, Momotaro went ogre hunting as soon as he was born.

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.940
Great. I picked that peach because I had a good feeling about it. Now, their pension is practically mine already.

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.980
As Momotaro traveled along his path, he encountered a dog.

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:47.000
Dog: Bow wow! Momotaro, Momotaro!

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.160
Momotaro: Wait, how do you know my name... Are you a stalker?

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.320
Well, sorry but... I'm not interested in that kind of stuff...

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.320
Well, I'll head my own way now, bye~

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.120
And so Momotaro left without making friends with that dog.

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.720
As he continued his journey, he later met with a monkey.

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.320
Monkey: Squeek~ Momotaro, Momotaro!

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.960
I heard that you have some kibi dango (a Japanese snack) with you...

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:15.720
Well, I'll be your friend, so, can I have one of your kibi dango?

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.560
Momotaro: Why do you know my name too?

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.840
Well, about the kibi dango...I kind of forgot and left it at home...

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.780
Well, I'll have to go now, sorry!

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.620
And so, Momotaro didn't make friends with the monkey either.

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.600
"Gosh that's dangerous... Why does it seem like everyone's stalking me?"

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.420
thought Momotaro, just before he met a beautiful girl as his quest continued.

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.820
Why does everyone know my name... Creepy...

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:46.780
Pretty Girl: Aaah~ Lord Momotaro~ I've heard the rumors...

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.800
They say that you have delicious kibi dango with you, right?

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.520
If you don't mind, can I have some?

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:59.180
In exchange, let's become friends!

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.180
Momotaro: Oh? You know my name too? Gosh, I'm shy... &gt;&lt;

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.280
About the kibi dango... Well, I don't have them with me now...

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:12.460
Let's grab some kibi dango together after I exterminate the ogres.

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:20.620
Even though Momotaro didn't befriend the dog and monkey, he did become friends with the beautiful girl that caught his eye.

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.920
She also happens to be the weakest in terms of battle power out of all of them.

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.180
And so, the two of them continued to flirt all the way to Onigashima.

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:32.440
I finally found you, ogre! I'm going to exterminate you now, alright? Gyaaaah!

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.760
As Momotaro fought, the ogre said these things.

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.920
Ogre: Wait a second! Stop! Momotaro, please wait!

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:47.020
Well, I'm sure you've heard, but... I haven't be able to make a girlfriend for the past 30 years...

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:50.540
Well... Momotaro, you're a fulfilled normie (riajuu), right?

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:53.660
Even though you won't understand my feelings, I still have to ask...

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:57.140
If you would give me the lass you have by your side...

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:01.960
I'll stop doing evil things... So, pretty please!

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:04.140
I want a girlfriend, please help me out.

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:10.040
Momotaro: Wait, so I don't have to fight if I hand her over? Well, that's fine, right? It's okay, right?

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:13.660
Pretty Girl: How could you... You're horrible, Momotaro!

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:18.660
Didn't we promise to eat kibi dango together?!

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:22.500
Momotaro: Well, I can just deliver some kibi dango to you later, right?

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.000
Well, here you go.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.320
YEAH! I WIN!

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:30.240
Even though Momotaro couldn't exterminate the ogre...

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:35.660
He managed to deal with it in some way. On his way back, he also managed to obtain the elixir of youth.

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:39.500
He thus returned home with the elixir in hand.

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:43.300
Momotaro: Yo, Grandma, Grandpa! I finally did it!

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:46.000
How was it?! I'm amazing, right? Ahahaha...

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:48.220
Well, you see, Grandma...

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:53.580
I have some elixir of youth with me... Won't you take a little sip?

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:57.780
What followed was that the old woman returned to her pretty, young form.

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:02.480
Well, Grandpa, half your pension is enough! I'll just take the beautiful Grandma along with me for the other half!

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:04.380
You'll give it to me? Thanks!

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:07.280
And so, Momotaro got both the money and the now beautiful "Grandma".

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:13.800
He then got back into his peach and sailed to the house of the next elderly couple.

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.700
End of story~

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:23.960
Everyone~ Make sure to watch this tale of Momotaro before bedtime!

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:27.140
And that performance was brought to you by Big Sister Ai!

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:28.400
See you soon~

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:38.840
