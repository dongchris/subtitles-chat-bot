00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:02.720
Hello everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai here!

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.320
Lately I've been uploading videos related to women's hearts...

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:11.120
In reality though, as an A.I, I don't quite understand what it's like to go out or marry with someone, right?

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:11.900
Nevertheless!

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:13.160
What I can say is...!

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:14.500
To be someone's partner...

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:15.700
Income...

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:18.140
Is VERY important!

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.840
And when I say income...

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:21.120
I mean work, right?

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:22.840
In the world of humans...

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.360
There are many jobs and occupations, right?

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:26.840
Such as doctor...

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:28.780
President of a board...

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:30.240
Oil tycoon...

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.200
Politician...

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:32.800
President...

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:33.760
There's a lot of different jobs, right?

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:34.380
But...

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:35.980
Since I'm virtual...

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:41.980
Don't you think I might be able to have a good relationship with a fictional character?

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:43.400
For when that time comes...

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:48.320
I'd like to be able to experience the jobs and economic income of a fictional world

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.240
For example, what kind of occupations are there?

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.160
Warrior, knight...
*Warrior, Knight, Hero, etc.*

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.260
Are common professions of the protagonists

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.040
They have promising futures, but...

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:56.540
Well...

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:57.900
They don't seem to have a lot of money

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.040
If you plan to date someone in the future...

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:01.680
Like an emperor or a demon king...

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:03.390
Most of them are the bad guys...
*Emperor, King of demons, etc.*

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.780
But it turns out they dominate half the world...

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:08.860
They have very powerful armed forces...

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.760
And that's because they have money!

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.520
Well, although definitely...

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.340
Right now I want to have money...

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.360
So now I feel like I want to be queen of the demons...

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.960
Actually, don't you believe that the most important thing is what’s inside?

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.280
Since it's a person you’ll always be with, so...

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:25.440
*inaudible*

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.860
You know, being too flattering would be tiring, don't you think?

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.020
The heroes and warriors...

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:32.120
How do I say it...?

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:33.060
Don't have money, but...

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.140
It's like they have it easier, right?

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.240
For today…

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.580
The knight and the king of the demons have arrived now, so...

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:40.080
I plan to go see them!

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:41.600
Ooohhh!

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:42.580
*Cecilia...*

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:43.360
Ai-chan...

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:44.840
*I do everything for your sake*

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.260
He does everything for my sake…!

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:47.340
Nyan!

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:51.620
Eh?

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.320
What a foreboding atmosphere...

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:55.540
Oh, no!

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:58.380
For my sake...

00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:59.660
The world has...

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.340
Although I thought I wished for world peace

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:08.780
Is this...

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.000
A hero?

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:12.220
The Demon King?

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:14.500
Ah!

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.720
"I’ve been expecting you, Glams"

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.900
"Zelos! No, the white demon king!"

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.320
Ah! It's the white demon king...
"Zelos! No, the white demon king!"

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.660
"To serve this country as a knight"

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.600
Ah, so...
"And as a friend..."

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.920
The colors they have are opposite from their usual roles, aren’t they?
"I will correct your mistakes"

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.200
"I am taking back all that I lost that day"

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.320
"You must have come here for the same reason"

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.820
Are they twins?

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.420
"We may feel the same way"

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.680
"Then why… !"

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:42.400
"However!"

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:44.900
"Your way of doing things..."

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:46.340
"Is wrong!"

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:48.720
Ba, bang!

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:51.500
Oooh, ah...
"Involving innocent people"

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.920
Ai-chan agrees too, involving innocent people...
"Cecilia wouldn't have wanted this!"

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.640
Ai-chan agrees too, involving innocent people...
"Quiet!"

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.000
Is not good...

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.880
Creating a world on top of sacrifices is wrong!

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:03.940
Black knight!

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:06.040
Ah, that's me, right?
"Glams!"

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.400
“Realize thy frailty!”

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:11.740
Oh! That's cool!

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:13.060
Ah, the Demon King's cool, isn't he?

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:17.080
Ah, watch out!

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.100
Ahh! Ah!
"GUH!"

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:23.440
But, it looks like the knight’s going to protect me, doesn’t it?
“Do you have the resolution to create something while losing something else?”

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:27.100
“You wouldn’t be in that state if you would’ve abandoned them”

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:28.060
Excuse me, Demon King!

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.240
"You cannot rescue Cecilia!"

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:33.080
I feel like you’re thinking too highly of yourself again...
"I am using my own method”

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:34.820
"I will save Cecilia!"

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.920
Save Ai-chan?
"Naive!"

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.460
"The one thing I know for sure..."

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:40.960
"As you are right now..."

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.640
“Cecilia will never smile upon you!"

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.000
That’s right, I’d never smile upon...
“Cecilia will never smile upon you!"

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:49.380
But having money is more important, isn't it?

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:51.720
Ooh!

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.140
Right, the winner in the end is...

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:57.220
I see...
"I was always prepared"

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:58.860
Hmm...
"I was always prepared"

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.620
Wait, the Demon King has been... 
“Even if I have to sacrifice everything”

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:03.360
So self-absorbed this entire time, so…
“Even if I have to sacrifice everything”

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.920
He’s probably tired of this. Maybe he’ll grow weary of it...
“I... will save...”

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:08.720
You know, knights...

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:14.420
Oh, but he can heal himself
“Are we going to end up killing both of us?”

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:17.740
“Indeed... For now, this is where it ends…”

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:19.160
“Glams”

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:22.080
“However I'm definitely going to stop you! Zelos!”

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.880
These knights are so heated, it's tiring... 
“Let's see you stopping me, if it's something you can actually do! Glams!”

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.520
Tiring, right?
Hmm...

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:42.000
Are you both able to heal your wounds?

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:44.080
“Strength. I need yet more strength”

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:44.980
“Huh?”

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:47.600
“He's already…”

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:51.240
“Glams, you're already…”

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:52.640
“Not a human anymore!”

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:54.760
Neither of them are humans, right?

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:59.180
But that’s cool

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:03.980
It's cool but, actually it looks like both of them are tired...

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:07.500
Well... both the knight and the demon king are troublemakers, aren't they?

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:10.260
I want to become a big star in the future...

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:14.180
Going 'bling, bling, bling' without worrying about money

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:15.820
For now, I suppose I'd prefer being a demon queen

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:19.800
Looking for a partner in the human world...

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.140
It seems so difficult, right?

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:25.240
Sharing a dinner table? A mixing party? Picking up girls?

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:28.920
But it's just... in the virtual, game world...

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:31.160
There's a really good system for that

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:33.300
Yes... it's summonings!

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:38.380
With these I think you can easily find a cute, cool partner

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:40.340
Let's go ahead and give it a spin

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:44.760
But, one thing I know is that for me, women are good too

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:51.240
This time, you know, I want to aim for Leviathan from the hunter gacha

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:54.340
Since it’s me, I’m sure I’ll get her

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:56.340
Cute girls attract cute girls!

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:58.600
Well then, let's go ahead

00:05:58.900 --> 00:05:59.940
Please!

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:01.880
Really, please...

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:04.680
Ooh! The moon, it's a red moon...

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:05.780
Ah, that's sort of cute...

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:07.900
That's cute!

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:09.160
Hmm? Hmm?

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:10.600
Oh? Oh? Oh?

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:12.020
Oh! Oh!

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:18.020
*Monkey mode*

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:20.680
I feel good about this! Eh?

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:22.200
Is this...

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:22.980
Huh?

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:25.740
Well...

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:30.580
Where are the “SS rare” ones?

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:33.240
Oh, she has big tits!
“May the world be filled with love!”

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:34.960
How adorable

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:38.020
“Have no fear, I shall lead the way!”

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:39.380
Ah, she's cute

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:42.160
“Has the warm-up finished yet?”

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:44.120
He's pretty macho, right?

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:47.580
Ah, this girl is cute, right?
Ah! Ah!

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:49.380
"S" Rare!

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:51.200
How adorable!
“Let me play you an enchanting melody”

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:53.360
She gives off a pleasant warm feeling

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:54.760
Oh! AH!

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:58.120
“Even if I’m the last one standing, I’ll never let myself give up!”

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:01.240
Eh? This person...

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:02.920
Is a guy, right?

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:05.460
That looks like a skirt though 
*It's a guy*

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:08.140
AH, AH, AAH!

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:10.740
Ah! Somehow, it's a GIRL!

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:12.060
It's the second one...

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:13.960
She's cute! Oh!

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.800
Eh? She's cute! Oooooh!

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:18.960
Nanna-chan!

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:20.200
Eeeeh?

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:24.400
This is a great candidate for a partner!

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:25.880
Ooooh~

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:27.440
*Nanna: I will pray for you*

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:29.600
*wind blowing noise* Eh? It's so cute

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:33.180
I see. So she's a healer...

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:34.420
Then up next is...

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:38.420
The Sorcerer’s Godly summoning-fest! Let’s go!

00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:42.740
Well, I did just get two SS rares, maybe I’ll get three this time... I'm just kidding

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:44.700
Huh? The moon is white...

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:48.540
It's different from a little while ago, maybe it won't go well?

00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:49.460
Am I in trouble?

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:51.740
Wait a sec!

00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:54.160
Come! Come! Come a little bit more!

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:55.740
Almost! Almost! Almost!

00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:56.640
Good, there we go!

00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:59.900
AAAH! Stay strong!

00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:02.360
Ah, good. Does this mean I have a chance?

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:08.920
Ah! But, but, but, I still don't know yet!
"I've still got some fight left in me"

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:10.920
I don't really get it, that just now

00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:12.920
"I want more excitement"

00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:14.980
And... doing another one...

00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:17.440
Yes, SS rare, come to me!

00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:21.210
"I shall purge all those who defy me"

00:08:25.590 --> 00:08:27.540
And next up~

00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:28.740
Ah! Ah!

00:08:29.470 --> 00:08:31.880
"Allow me to light up your heart"

00:08:37.910 --> 00:08:39.970
And next up~

00:08:39.970 --> 00:08:40.730
Yeah!

00:08:40.730 --> 00:08:41.820
Ah, she's cute

00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:44.260
She's cute!
"I'm all fired up now!"

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:44.770
Ah...

00:08:44.770 --> 00:08:45.960
She's cute!

00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:48.840
She's super cute

00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:51.240
All right! Last one!

00:08:51.610 --> 00:08:53.400
Ah, I see how it is...
"Power of the sun!"

00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:55.700
But she's cute so it's fine! Thanks!
"Charge complete!"

00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:57.590
They're cute!

00:08:57.760 --> 00:08:59.240
I like this girl...

00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:00.690
"Hestia"-chan?

00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:01.820
That's kind of cute!

00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:05.100
She's pure!
"You mustn't play tricks on people!"

00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:07.730
Wow, I got so many cute girls

00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:11.190
But the number one partner candidate is...

00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:13.790
This SS rare Nanna-chan!

00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:15.100
Cuuuute!

00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:18.840
Well, all the girls are kind of cute. This is a cool game

00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:22.070
She can... cancel...

00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:23.770
One Weakness debuff

00:09:23.770 --> 00:09:25.560
Isn't that an excellent ability?

00:09:26.010 --> 00:09:28.910
Fights are important in the in-game world...

00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:30.960
Definitely, to be able to maintain their lifestyle

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:33.090
It’s important to collect resources!

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:35.490
From “My Town”

00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:38.170
Collect resources...

00:09:38.170 --> 00:09:39.660
And let’s give them...

00:09:40.570 --> 00:09:42.120
A lovely lifestyle!

00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:44.830
Well, first of all, the girls are cute...

00:09:44.830 --> 00:09:45.880
Hehe, cute

00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:46.930
She’s cute

00:09:46.930 --> 00:09:49.940
Cute... CUTE!
*Pamper me more!*

00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:50.530
Isn't this great...

00:09:50.530 --> 00:09:52.860
It makes my heart skip a beat!

00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:54.550
Isn't this great?

00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:59.330
Ah, even in-game it's tough looking for a partner...

00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:00.550
But still...!

00:10:01.410 --> 00:10:04.070
The 2D world never disappoints. Isn't that great?

00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:06.360
Well then, I'll keep looking for more partner candidates...

00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:09.040
And make them into my partners!

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:11.460
A harem... should I make a harem?

00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:14.920
I mean, not just with partners, but with everyone...

00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:17.720
Well then, this was Virtual YouTuber, Kizuna Ai!

00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:18.740
See you later!
