00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:00.940
Yo!

00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:02.860
Virtual Youtuber,
Kizuna Ai here!

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:03.820
What's up?

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:05.120
You humans out there watching,

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:06.680
You guys have worries all the time, right?

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:08.060
Must be really hard to live that way, right?

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:10.200
Well, everybody feels like that sometimes, ya know?

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.580
And here at Kizuna Ai Channel HQ,

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.060
we like to take the negative situations life throws at us

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:15.080
and turn them into positives!

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:15.800
On that note,

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.280
today I'll be trying to change my human viewer's

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:19.640
negative feelings into non-negative feelings!

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:20.980
At first glance,

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:23.300
sometimes things can seem like the end of the world,

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.400
but if you think hard enough about it, you can always find a silver lining!

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:26.440
For example,

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:27.120
kawaii soundâ™ª

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:28.760
[Nope-Inducing Bug Appears in Your House]

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:30.440
Let's say a creepy-ass insect infiltrates your home.

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.660
How can we turn this situation of badness into one of goodness?

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:34.880
I've found a solution!

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.860
Maybe this bug is some kind of never-before discovered species!

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.620
That would mean that your house must be so good that even rare bugs wanna live there!

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:47.540
Okay, up next we have:

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:48.480
[Forgetting Your Umbrella on Rainy Day]

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.000
Let's say that you forget your umbrella one day when it's pouring down outside.

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.960
"Aww fuck", right? NO "AWW FUCK!"

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.660
Get outta here with your first world problems!

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.760
People throughout history had to suffer without umbrellas, you know!

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.520
So will it kill you to just go one day, getting a little wet!?

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.160
Just because it's raining, doesn't mean you gotta be all emo about it.

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:06.680
It's times like these where you should say:

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.200
"Oh well, least I'm not infected with the black plague."

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.480
And the hype yourself up, enjoy the little things,

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.300
and overcome each and every day like your some shounen protagonist!

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:14.920

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.840
"Hey, dude. Getting all worked up like that is gonna totally give you heart disease.

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.220
Take a chill pill, watch some ASMR or something.

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.640
Failure isn't bad, it's a chance to learn from your mistakes."

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:36.840
Oh yeah, and

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.660
when you're squaring off with your senpai

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:41.440
You should absorb their passion and loudness

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:42.660
and then...

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:43.340
throw it right back at 'em!

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:44.680

[Liking a Same Person with Your Best Friend]

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.580
"Liking a Same Person with Your Best Friend'

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.940
Why are you getting depressed 
from thinking that kind of thing?

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.000
"Oh, we really are good friends"

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.520
go with that flow with your friend,

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.220
and then stole them from your friend!

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:02.720
If you get depressed from that,

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:05.120
Love is not something you...hold on!

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:06.980
There's no such thing as fate! (?)

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:09.360
You should just grab your own fate!

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.480
So beat up that friend of yours!

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.500
You got it?

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.980
And for the last one:

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.280
"You're The Only One 
Not Invited to A Drinking Party"

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.480
You need to think like this,

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:23.860
"Well, even if I joined,

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.460
I'll just make the host uneasy

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:29.000
and drinking party is only for lazy people, right?"

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:30.380
By not going to the party,

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.940
you who worked hard at home is amazing!

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.180
Even if you're not invited to the party,

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:36.540
in 10-20 years,

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.480

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:39.180
Go for it!

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:41.740
That was perfect, right?

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:43.920
So if you're feeling down,

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.060
or depressed,

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.600
or "I've been scolded for this thing!"

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.300
Please tell me about it, okay?

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:52.240
I'm going to turn everything into positive!

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:55.080
