Hello everyone! Virtual Youtuber Kizuna Ai here!

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:05.480
Let's not waste time and announce today's topic

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:07.960
"If you watch this you will get to know everything about Kizuna Ai!"

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:09.520
Kizuna Ai Dictionary

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:11.200
YEAH!

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.840
With that said, it might be odd but let's start now!

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:16.340
Recently there have been more and more people watching my videos

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:17.780
And I feel so happy about that!

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:21.120
But I have also been thinking about words I use constantly

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.020
If you’ve been watching me since the very beginning, you might understand what I'm saying

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:25.520
But...

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:26.580
There is a lot of videos

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.300
And I thought "If you didn't, it might be hard to fully understand"

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:31.540
That's why I'm making this video

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:33.220
As expected from a genius!

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:34.260
Kizuna Ai Dictionary

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.000
If you watch this, you’ll know more about me!

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:38.200
Pay Attention!

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:39.620
A.I.Channel!

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:40.580
“Kizuna Ai”

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:43.740
A super A.I. That suddenly appeared in Virtual Reality

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.100
Started as a YouTuber with the wish of "bonding with humans"

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.820
A young girl who is both abnormally beautiful and has an  incredibly smart brain!

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.560
Her singing skills helped her to gain popularity

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.380
Her skills with the microphone are always melting her fans’ hearts!

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:57.500
Loving money too much is her only fault

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:58.520
Hai domo!
(Hello everyone)

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.280
A greeting that Kizuna Ai almost always uses in the beginning of her videos

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.440
If you think of Kizuna Ai, you think of "Hai domo"

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:06.640
If you think of "Hai domo", you think of Kizuna Ai

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.920
With the relationship between the two

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.940
The reason she originally started using it has been forgotten

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:11.560
Friend

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.140
An equal relationship between one another who can share feelings with

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:16.100
But it’s purchasable

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.620
Good!

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:17.340
Good thing

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:17.840
Good stuff

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:18.620
Adjective

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:20.040
An extension of "good"

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.660
Or, a word that Kizuna Ai will say

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:24.820
When she is confused about what to say about her feelings

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:26.180
YEAH!

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.940
A word that expresses a rush of excitement or feeling

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:31.680
Or when Kizuna Ai is troubled by the comments...

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.000
I think that “everything will be fine if I just say this”

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.780
Crisis Averted

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.160
A word to say when escaping from a predicted dangerous event or situation

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.280
Or… A line that Kizuna Ai always says when she uses...

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:43.720
Her inborn abilities...

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.020
To escape danger!

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:46.060
Even when she couldn’t escape

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.280
I think that “everything will be fine if I just say this”

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:49.080
Pyoko Pyoko

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.340
Dancing with small body movement, moving like jumping

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.120
It’s also the name of Kizuna Ai’s headband

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.815
There is a rumor that the Pyoko Pyoko is Kizuna Ai’s real form?”

00:01:57.815 --> 00:02:00.955
However, no one knows the truth yet!

00:02:00.955 --> 00:02:01.955
Ai-taaan Beam!

00:02:02.115 --> 00:02:05.185
The name of the beam that Kizuna Ai emits from her head

00:02:05.185 --> 00:02:08.085
People who get hit directly will be taken over by Kizuna Ai’s cuteness

00:02:08.085 --> 00:02:11.465
And contract an incurable disease called "Love"

00:02:11.465 --> 00:02:14.105
It’s a plagiarized pose of a certain idol, but...

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.620
Of course, nothing happens

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:16.760
Genius

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:17.820
Kizuna Ai

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:18.900
Techitechi Bird

00:02:19.645 --> 00:02:22.615
A sad monster born by mixing a Munchkin and a parrot

00:02:22.615 --> 00:02:25.265
The details of its wild behavior are unknown, but it only loves Kizuna Ai

00:02:25.445 --> 00:02:27.520
Its squeak is maybe something like… “Nuun!”

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.240
Instaaaall!

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:32.880
The act of introducing new hardware or software to a computer

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.020
That word has become some sort of joke among the ones that are with her, but...

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:37.480
I don’t feel like it is a joke

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:38.420
How was it?!

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.340
Do you guys feel a lot more familiar with the words I used?

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:43.340
Did you guys take any notes?

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:44.580
Please remember it!

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.560
This part! It will be included in the test!

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.240
This was Virtual Youtuber Kizuna Ai!

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:50.540
See you later!~

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:51.820
Nice, nice!

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:53.960
We need more translators!
