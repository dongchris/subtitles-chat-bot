00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:31.500
[Sam] Anything good?

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:33.700
Your photos.

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.340
You've﻿ ﻿been at it for
﻿like﻿﻿ ﻿﻿﻿the﻿﻿ ﻿past﻿ 45 minutes.

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:37.700
They're good, I just--

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.300
Wait, ha-have you been&nbsp;watching me
this whole time?

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:44.100
What? No.

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.000
I mean. Yeah but, it's my job to. *gestures to "Security" label on jacket*

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.900
Sort of.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.300
I'm just waiting for my shift&nbsp;to end
and I noticed you.

00:00:55.056 --> 00:00:56.906
Sorry. That was a little creepy, huh?

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:58.600
It's fine, I get it.

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.400
Hey, I know it's kind&nbsp;of VIP up here
but&nbsp;if you ask me,

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.240
the best view is on the ground level.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.500
Yeah, you're probably right.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.200
Uh, I'm just trying to get this one shot in.

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.000
Can I see?

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.300
Sure. If you want.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.400
Wow, these are really good.

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.000
I'm not sure what else you're looking for.

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.400
Yeah I'm not totally sure either but,

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.700
I think I'll know when I see it.

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:38.400
Thanks for sharing.

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:40.000
I'm Sam, by the way.

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:41.300
Sorry about earlier.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Uh, Carmen and, don't worry about it.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.700
[radio] First shift switch off.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.240
Well I'm off. Hey, good luck
with everything.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:51.900
Thanks.

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:01.800
Hey Carmen!

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:04.200
You hungry?

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.260
[Sam]&nbsp;Yeah this place fills up fast.

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.000
[Carmen]&nbsp;What's good to eat around here?

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.100
Do you get the hook up because
you work here or something?

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.900
[Sam]&nbsp;I wish. I've only worked here
for a few months.

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.300
How long have you been shooting?

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.600
[Carmen] Uh... a little over a year.

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:31.500
It's just a hobby.

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:33.750
You should keep it up.

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:36.800
Yeah, maybe.

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:38.750
We'll see...&nbsp;[sighs]

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:40.300
in a few months.

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.000
What happens in a few months?

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:45.400
Graduation.

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.400
And then... [sighs]

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:50.335
Life.

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.000
Ah, gotcha.

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:53.600
What's your major?

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Communications.

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:56.600
Cool

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.600
What do you want to do with that?

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:00.600
I don't know. It...

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.000
can be applied to a lot of things, really.

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.400
I switched from Bio, which...

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.300
my parents weren't too happy about&nbsp;but um,

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.000
now that I'm almost done,

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.000
not sure if that was right choice.

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.000
Oh you won't know until you try.

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.400
It's like food.

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.600
How do I know
if want the Bulgogi truffle fries

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:27.967
﻿or﻿ the﻿﻿ ﻿﻿um...﻿﻿

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:29.800
ahi tuna sushirrito.

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.700
I mean they both sound delicious but,

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.600
How can I decide unless
I can taste them both?

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:38.600
I'd go with the fries. No question.

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.600
Everyone knows the sushirrito
is this bigger unfinished sushi roll

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:44.140
that's more rice than anything.

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:48.400
Perfect. You get the fries.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.400
Alright, I warned you!

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:53.500
I won't know 'til I try!

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
Just admit it, you were wrong.

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:16.700
No, I never said it wouldn't taste good.

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:19.600
I just said it wouldn't be the best
bang for your buck.

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.600
Well, I have no regrets.

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:28.560
Sushirrito, truffle fries... both good.

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:34.400
But why can't more things in life be as simple
as ordering from a food truck menu?

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.700
Wait, sorry. The fries were "Comm"
and the sushirrito was "Bio," right?

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:43.200
Or was it the other way around?

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:45.700
It doesn't matter.

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:47.800
Poor analogy to begin with.

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.500
Hey, I'm... sorry for...

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:57.100
unloading all that stuff on you earlier
when we just met.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.200
It's kind of a downer...

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:03.580
especially at something like this.

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:05.800
Don't worry about it.

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:08.700
The world is full of downers.

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:12.100
You think any of these people
know exactly what they are doing?

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:14.100
I don't know.

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.500
He seems to have it pretty figured out.

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:19.600

Jonathan Keane

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:48.300
He just graduated law school because
he promised his parents he would.

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:52.900
But what he really wants to do
is open a café in the Arts District.

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:55.700
It's going to be tough.

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:59.100
These two, been together for five years.

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:02.200
He wants her to move in but,

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:06.800
she hasn't told him about the amazing
promotion she was offered overseas yet.

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:09.120
And this one,

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:11.300
she...

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:14.100
just graduated.

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:19.200
Not really ready to take on the world yet.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.800
She knows what she has to do but,

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:29.000
at the same time she's scared she'd get
lost in the crowd if there's nothing else.

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:34.360
She's got her whole life
to take on the world.

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:35.600
And now,

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:39.600
she just has to take care of herself.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
You don't know any
of those people, do you?

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:50.440
No idea.

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:53.300
I don't know anything except that,

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:55.500
everyone is in a different place

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:57.600
and figuring out what's best for them.

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:00.000
So where are you?

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:02.600
I'm getting there.

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:06.180
For now I just like...

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:08.400
this.

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:11.700
The people.

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:13.500
The music.

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:15.800
The spirit.

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:19.500
It makes me happy.

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:22.640
So,

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:24.720
I'll do what I can to stay.

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:29.200
If that means being a...

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:31.600
mid-level event security guard,

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:34.920
I'll take it.

00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:39.420
You are a protector.

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:43.100
A guardian of...

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:46.200
rare moments like these.

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:52.000
When people can escape the troubles
in their hearts and minds.

00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:57.500
I like that.

00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:03.000
You think that could fit on like
a business card or something? [laughs]

00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:10.600
You know... I feel like,

00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:13.500
we're all given a scene.

00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:19.200
A combination
of people, places, and things that...

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:22.920
we don't have any control over it.

00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:27.100
But it's up to us to frame it in a way...

00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:30.020
to get the best shot.
