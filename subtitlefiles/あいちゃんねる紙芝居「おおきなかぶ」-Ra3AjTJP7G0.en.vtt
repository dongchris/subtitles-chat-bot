The Giant Turnip

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:08.120
An old man planted some turnip seeds in the soil

00:00:08.465 --> 00:00:11.865
"May you grow and sweet and tasty, oh turnip of mine."

00:00:11.865 --> 00:00:15.085
"May you grow big and healthy, oh turnip of mine."

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.020
Soon after, the turnip grew to be larger than ever

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:22.775
Larger than any turnip that anyone have ever seen before

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:26.340
It is one big turnip indeed

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.240
"Oh my, how wonderful!"

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.200
"I shall pull you up, I shall."

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.020
And so the old man starts to pull the turnip

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:38.060
"And a heave and a ho!"

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.140
The turnip stayed rooted in the soil

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:42.860
"That's it!"

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.940
And so the old man called his wife to come and help him

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:48.200
"Ready, go!"

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.380
"And a heave and a ho!"

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:54.820
And so the old man starts to pull the turnip

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.840
And the old woman pulls the old man

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.880
"And a heave and a ho!"

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.700
And yet the turnip stays rooted to the ground

00:01:05.255 --> 00:01:06.335
"That's it!"

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:10.000
The old woman called for her granddaughter to come and help

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:11.860
"Ready, go!"

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:15.180
"And a heave and a ho!"

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.140
And so the old man starts to pull the turnip

00:01:18.195 --> 00:01:21.055
And the old woman pulls the old man

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.000
And her granddaughter pulls the old woman

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.140
"And a heave and a ho!"

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:31.220
Still, the turnip refuses to move

00:01:32.065 --> 00:01:33.065
"That's it!"

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.760
The granddaughter called to Techi-techi bird to come and help.

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:38.700
"Ready, go!"

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.260
"And a heave and a ho!"

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.360
And so the old man starts to pull the turnip

00:01:45.585 --> 00:01:48.365

"And a heave and a ho!"

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.840
The ever so stubborn turnip still stays rooted to the ground

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:03.220
"Squeak!"

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:07.400
Techi-techi bird brought over a friend, Mirrat

00:02:08.515 --> 00:02:11.305
However, Mirrat could not move

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.920
Feeling sorry, Mirrat called a nearby Pegasus

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.620
"Ready, go!"

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.980
"And a heave and a ho!"

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.940
