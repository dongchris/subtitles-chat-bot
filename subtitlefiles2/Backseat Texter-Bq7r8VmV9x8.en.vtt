00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:08.260
Hey.

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:08.940
Hey Lily.

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.300
We gonna be late?

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:12.000
Uh, I think we'll be okay.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.340
But, um, could you help me navi though?

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:14.660
I'm terrible at multitasking.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.560
Um, passcode is 1028.

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.420
Yeah, I trust you

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.120
Just, don't go through the selfie album

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.980
Uh, go down main, then we're going straight to 2 miles

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:30.720
Who's Natalie?

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:37.500
Oh, she's just this co-worker from the office and she's super creepy asking me out

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.000
What did you say?

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.160
"Hey! I think I saw you at 7 Grand last night".

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.620
just tell her sorry I must have missed

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.680
Sorry. I missed you. Sent.

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.660
Wait! What did you say?

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.670
No, you can't put a period after sorry!

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.260
That makes, "I missed you" a completely new thought

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.600
And you even added an emoji..
I didn't know...

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:01.680
Oh, she sent a snap

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.600
just give me the phone at the next red light

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.620
THE ONE TIME...

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:14.740

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:21.940

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:24.190

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:37.720
