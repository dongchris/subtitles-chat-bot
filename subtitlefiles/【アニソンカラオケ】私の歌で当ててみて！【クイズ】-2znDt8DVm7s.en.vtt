00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:02.660
Hello everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai here!

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:04.560
Today, I plan to do...

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:05.440
♪ Chachaaan! ♪

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:07.980
A karaoke ranking of anime songs!

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:09.920
Yaaay! Pafu pafu!

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:12.640
Last time, I did a questionnaire regarding anime song rankings

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:14.460
This time, I’ll do the karaoke version!

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:18.000
There were a lot of people who wanted to hear me sing, so then...

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.140
I decided to hear your opinions ♪

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:21.700
I plan to sing a lot!

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:23.460
Good, in this case, let's start at once!

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:26.560
Karaoke anime song rankings of the year 2017

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.700
First I’ll announce the songs at 10th to 6th place

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:29.780
But...

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:31.380
I won’t dedicate to just simply announcing them...

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:36.280
Some will be hidden, so then try to guess them when I sing them in karaoke

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:37.380
Oh! I see...

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.560
There are songs that been around for a long time...

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:42.780
But the one at 6th place is relatively new, right?

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:43.440
Eh?

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:46.260
"Story" is an anime song?

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.640
I didn't know that!

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:48.680
Eeeeh?

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:49.240
And then...!

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.640
The one that’s at 10th place is...

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.440

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:59.780

Well, I only said one phrase that sounds familiar at the end

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.000

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.520

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:42.400
I’ll announce the 5th to 1st place right away!

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.640
Oh, there’s several that aren’t hidden!

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:45.840
Ah, this is...!

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.640
"Sugar Song to Bitter Step" is for dancing, right?
(Play on words with "Step" and dancing)

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:50.240
Was I mistaken?

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.580
"Butter-fly" is from "Digimon"! I know it, I know it

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:54.280
And then, the 5th, 3rd and 1st places...

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:55.180
Are hidden, right?

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:57.080
What do you think they are?

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.960

Man, it's a very famous song! Right?

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:56.780
I wonder if there's someone who doesn’t know it

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:59.740
It always seems to appear in the karaoke ranks

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:02.420
And the work of "Evangelion" is also very entertaining!

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:04.400
Having said that, what do you think...?

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:05.920
Of the karaoke anime song rankings?

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.020
The karaoke song rankings...

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:09.140
Doesn't change much, right?

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:10.140
It’s pretty much set

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:11.640
They’re like the standard songs as always

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:15.340
I wonder if one day, my song will appear here

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:19.620
Man, it’ll turn into a standard song, what a problem!

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:22.300
Well, before I release my own song...

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:29.060
In this expanding business world of the A.I’s, digital YouTubers and idols...

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:30.940
Would I survive?

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:35.020
I want to survive!

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.780
I want...

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:39.120
I want to survive

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:42.300
I still want to...

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:44.700
Keep surviving (?)

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:48.140
This was Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai!

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:49.040
