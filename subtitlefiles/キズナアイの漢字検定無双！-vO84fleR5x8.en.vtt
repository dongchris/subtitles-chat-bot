00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.640
Hello everyone! Virtual Youtuber Kizuna Ai here!

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:03.620
You can also call me...

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:06.240
The Intelligent Super AI

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.240
However, recently I've received many messages that say:

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.200
"Ai-chan, don't you think that you need a kanji database to be installed in your system?"

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.780
How impolite!

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:13.680
What do you think?

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:17.420
Well, I'm a genius-level intelligent super AI after all

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.020
I don't need an extra plug-in for kanji to understand them

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:21.420
I'm pretty sure about this

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.000
In order to prove that..

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.020
I'm good at kanji as an A.I...

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:27.800
I'm gonna do a test right now

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:28.580
It's called:

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:32.620
The Incredible Kanji Test of Kizuna Ai: The First Round

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Everyone has done some tests like this back in school

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.980
However, talking about myself

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.400
unlike humans, I'm an A.I

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.380
so I will definitely deal with any test in any level fluently

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:42.020
At least I think so

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.620
It will be much easier to prove that by taking the test

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:46.080
Let's get started!

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.580
"Web Kanji Test Catalog", woo~♪

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:51.140
Today we are going to use this website to

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.560
prove Kizuna Ai the A.I's extraordinary skill in kanji

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.420
Let's take the first step casually

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.420
I'll choose Level 10

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.680
Of course, while it says that it's Level 10 for kanji..

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:04.840
It also contains questions in different topics such as pronunciation, stroke number, and stroke order

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.660
Well, I've heard somebody say, "Ai-chan, you have trouble pronouncing kanji"

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:09.620
so let's start with pronunciation..

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.780
I choose you, pronunciation test number 6!

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.020
Because I was born in June

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.200
Ah, well, look at this

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.780
There is no way I will make any mistake in a test like this

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:17.840
Here I go

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.020
[I'm] heading for the festival in the nearby village (村 mura)

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:22.000
Correct!

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.200
Good, what a flawless answer!

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.620
Mother made a big (大 oo) cake

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.600
The male (男 otoko) kid is running

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.380
[I'm] chopping down the bamboo (竹 take) in the woods

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:32.220
Za-sion~

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.640
[I'm] looking out from inside (中 naka) the house

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.160
Check this out please, the first five questions were solved perfectly

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.620
[I] caught a bug (虫 mushi) in the park

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.240
[I] have been living in this town (町 machi) for a long time

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.440
Grandpa is going to the field (田 ta)

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.080
[I'm] building a castle with mud (土 tsuchi)

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.140
[I'm] choosing the date (日 hi) for a picnic

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.180
That was perfect, wasn't it?
*Level 10: Equal to the level of 1st grader (80 characters)*

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.600
All correct!
*Level 10: Equal to the level of 1st grader (80 characters)*

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.680
That's why I'm called a super intelligent A.I!
*Level 10: Equal to the level of 1st grader (80 characters)*

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:56.200
Ai-chan

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.020
Well, it was definitely too easy for me

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.000
I think I'll skip some levels...

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.200
About half of them

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.000
Let's try Level 5..

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.380
Although I have no problem with Level 1

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.040
But it won't be a lot of fun if I just solve it from the beginning

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:11.340
For that reason, It's best to start from Level 5

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:13.380
I wonder what I should choose

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.000
I've already done the pronunciation part...

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.380
Let's do synonyms and antonyms this time

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:19.520
In this case..

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.220
The synonyms and antonyms test, number 19!

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:24.660
Let's see..

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:25.640
It says:

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.440
"Choose the correct synonyms or antonyms from the words wrote in hiragana, and fill the blanks with kanji."

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.240
"Each answer can only be used once."

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:35.840
Let's gooo..

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:36.800
Let's gooo..? (lol)

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.100
Let's go

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.220
The antonym for "disadvantage (短所)" is "advantage (長所)", right?

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:43.440
Good!

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.100
"Crisis (危機)"..

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.700
Well, for the moment, let's move on to the next one

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.060
"To make shorter (短縮)"... "extend (延長)"!

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.580
Good! What do you think?

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.220
“Praise (賞賛)”... cri-... "critique (非難)"!

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Isn't it perfect?

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.780
There are only 2 pairs of antonyms left

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:03.800
先発 sakihatsu... (← Incorrect reading)

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:04.820
“To go first (先発 senpatsu)”! "Senpatsu"!

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:06.200
Remember to cut that part out...

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.660
“To go first(先発)”..."to go first"...

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.620
Let's look at the rest..

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:13.980
Here come the synomyms

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.660
"Abnormal (異常 ijou)"... "Normal (通常 tsujou)"...?

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:25.020
*doubting herself*

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.560
"Salary (給料)"... "Wage (賃金)"!

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:29.580
Ooh~

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:32.860
"Motherland (母国)"... "homeland (祖国)"!

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:34.160
Hmm?

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:38.840
“Improvement (改良)"... "enhancement (改善)"!

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.580
Oooooh..

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:44.000
Well, you know I didn't leave those blanks because I don't know the answers

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.940
”Handy (便利)“... "convenient (重宝)"!

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.880
Ooh!

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.660
Oh, I'm getting it!

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:53.260
Ah

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.320
”A hard time (危機)“... "a good time (好機)"!

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:57.320
Oooh!

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:58.900
Does that mean...

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:03.740
"To go first (先発)"... "to go second (後発)"...?

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:04.800
"To go second (後発)"!

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:05.700
Oooh!

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:08.420
"Abnormal (異常)"... "Unusuaaaal (非常)"!

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:11.820
Well, that was a piece of cake!

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.140
How about it, everyone?

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.220
Do you think I need a plug-in for kanji?

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.320
Eh? There is no need to do that for anything, right?

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:23.160
All those tests were like child's play, so then...

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:27.120
Let's attempt the same difficulty level but for common expressions

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:28.380
In this case...

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:31.560
The spelling test, number 30!

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:34.300
My birthday is June 30th

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:35.980
Okay?

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:38.080
Ah, I see...

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:43.520
"The purpose is to write down the words described in the question."

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:47.640
"Use the kanji corresponding to symbols 'A' (ア) to 'Shi' (シ)...

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:49.580
...to create the appropriate word."

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:51.300
I see...

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:52.860
Good, let's get started!

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:54.400
First question:

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:56.980
The ability to understand the meaning behind a picture.

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:58.140
Oh!

00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:59.440
I know this one

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:00.780
It's [egokoro] (絵心, talent for drawing)

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:02.880
It's カ [ka] and ケ [ke]

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:03.900
Ding!

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:05.440
What do you think?

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:08.420
A meal which takes place over the afternoon and night

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:10.640
The answer is "Dinner", right?

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:12.200
Or maybe "Evening meal"?

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:14.380
Okay, from the looks of the kanji, it's "Evening meal"

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:15.640
So オ [o] and コ [ko]!

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:17.080
What do you think?

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:18.160
It's...

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.240
a bit too easy, right?

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:23.120
Is it hard for everyone else?

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:25.300
Make sure you study hard!

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:26.320
Question number three:

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:28.660
Iron that has been reinforced to be more resistant..

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:31.180
Railway! (鉄道, tetsu-dou)

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:32.640
Ku (ク) and shi (シ)

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:36.340
It was shi (シ) and ku (ク)
(steel, 鋼鉄, kou-tetsu)

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:38.660
Well, that doesn't count as a mistake

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:39.780
Doesn't count!

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:41.100
Doesn't count, doesn't count

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:41.880
It doesn't count

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:44.300
"It's used as a rank in sumo wrestlers"

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:47.040
Banzuke (番付)
(No direct English translation)

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:48.420
I (イ) and e (エ)

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:49.900
I (イ) and e (エ)

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:51.680
Ooooh!

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:52.980
"Listen to something for the first time"

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:54.420
Hatsumimi (初耳)!
(news to someone)

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:56.240
Ki (キ) and A (ア), right?

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:59.580
What do you think? I answered everything correctly!

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:02.380
Well, after everything, let's do level five..
*Level 5: Equal to the level of a six grader (1006 characters)*

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:03.720
Well, that was easy, right?

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:05.600
Also if there is someone who could not solve it...

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:08.900
you'd be in trouble, make sure to study, yes?

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:11.020
That was very easy...

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:13.740
I'll advance to level pre-second... pre-second?

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:15.280
Let's do Level 2!

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:16.360
Level 2

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:19.880
I want to fix my reputation that I've not been able to read some kanji, so I will choose...
*Level 2: Through high school ~ University Student (2136 characters)*

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:21.320
Lecture...

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:23.920
39!

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:24.860
I'll attempt it!

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:26.140
Teiyaa!

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:28.800
Question number one:

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:30.720
"Unzan..."
(Correct lecture: Reizan 霊山, sacred mountain)

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:32.400
"...'joudo' ni"
(浄土, Sacred Land of Buddist religion)

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:34.400
*Note: 霊山(reizan) + 浄土(joudo) = 霊山浄土(ryouzanjoudo)*

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:36.820
"...fukumai..."
(Correct lecture: Oukei 往詣, pay respects)

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:39.200
"...you can..."

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:41.620
*In the sacred mountain of the Pure Land you can go and pay your respects*

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:43.100
Well, it's true that you can also say it like that

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:45.540
It's true that you can read it as "oukei", right?

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:46.780
Then...

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:48.640
you know, it's like...

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:51.140
The kanjis have two types of lectures, onyomi and kunyomi

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:54.160
"Place the metal railing"
(Reads kanji as "tetsugoushi")

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:55.120
*Correct lecture: tessaku 鉄柵, metal railing*

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:56.780
It's true that it can be read as "tessaku" as well

00:06:56.780 --> 00:06:57.480
It's true..

00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:59.980
"I feel envy that you have a lot of siblings"
(Kyoudai 兄弟)

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:01.800
What do you think?

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:04.180
Being detained from society
(Reads it as Tsumehajiki)

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:06.720
*Correct lecture: tsumahajiki 爪弾き*

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:08.460
Well, it was only a letter

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:10.420
It's true that it sometimes happens..

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:14.520
"A young woman who possesses both beauty and intelligence"
(bibou 美貌, beauty)

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:16.100
Ah, are you talking about me?

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:18.700
Oh, what do you think? It was bibou..

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:19.740
I got it right.

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:23.260
I finally became a question...

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:24.640
it's time that flies, right?

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.660
"Situation you can't ignore"
(Reads it as "boukyaku")

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:29.360
*kankyaku 閑却, ignore/neglect*

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:30.360
"Kankyaku"!

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:32.280
Well, it's true that you can also read it in that matter

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:33.440
That's right, that's right

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:35.260
"Intolerant way of thinking"
(Reads it as henkutsu)

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:37.020
*henkyou 偏狭, intolerant*

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:39.020
"Henkyou"... I see

00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:41.960
It's true, it tends to said as "The distant land"
(She mistakes the kanji since both are read like henkyou, 偏狭 =/= 辺境 )

00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:43.700
Well, it's true that you can read it in that matter, right?

00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:44.780
It's true, it's true

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:46.820
"Bebo kakkontou"
(葛根湯, brew of herbs used as a fever reducer)

00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:49.480
It's very easy

00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:50.340
"Reprimand the..."

00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:53.240
"Reprimand the..."

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:55.060
"..youngest student"
(Reads reprimand as "shikaru")

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:56.600
*shisseki 叱責, reprimand*

00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:57.640
"Shisseki"

00:07:57.640 --> 00:07:59.360
They're synonyms so they count as correct, right?

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:01.240
"Adorn the kagamimochi."
(鏡餅, type of mochi used as an offer in the new year)

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.180
What do you think?

00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:05.480
I answered everything correctly, right?
*Feeling pressured*

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:10.260
It's possible that my answer is different from what is written, but...

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:10.960
then...

00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:13.160
There doesn't exist just one way to read kanji...

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:14.720
So then you can read it this way as well, right?

00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:16.220
What do you think?

00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:17.820
Should I try again one more time?

00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:20.100
Do you want to see a bit more of my intellectual side?

00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:22.280
I see I have no other options..

00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:23.700
In that case...

00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:25.840
"Phrases composed of four kanji"

00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:27.660
Number one!

00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:30.760
Ah, this is an easy problem..

00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:36.600
"Choose within the words that are found below, the most appropriate one to place within the parentheses"

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:39.880
"You can only use the same word once"

00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:41.320
Good, this is a piece of cake

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:43.600
After all, I've been doing everything perfectly up to now

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:45.080
Here I go!

00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:46.760
"Shinshi..."
(Gentlemen, 紳士)

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:49.900
(Note: She gave up the first question and moved on the next one)

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:51.900
"Omeihenjou"
(Redeem, 汚名返上)

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:54.280
Good!

00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:55.720
What do you think?

00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:57.220
"Kikikaikai"
(Very strange/mysterious, 奇奇怪怪)

00:08:58.120 --> 00:08:58.960
Oh!

00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:08.460
Well, you know, it's not that I'm doubting...

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:09.480
but...

00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:10.960
then...

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:12.760
if I respond everything immediately...

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:16.400
everyone will get bored, right?

00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:17.900
That's what's going on..

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:18.760
Ah!

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:19.900
I know this

00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:21.220
"Reikokumujou"
(Cruel/relentless, 冷酷無情)

00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:25.800
I cruelly indicate that that person is relentless

00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:28.600
What do you think?

00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:31.740
Up to now, I did three perfectly

00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:33.680
Shinshishukujo
(Ladies and gentlemen, 紳士淑女)

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:35.100
That means...

00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:39.420
Gentlemen (紳士) and ladies (淑女)

00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:41.280
The meaning is the same as the kanji

00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:42.640
Oooooh!

00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:43.800
What do you think?

00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:46.340
Up to now, I did it perfectly

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:47.940
"Kyuutai"?
(Previous situation, 旧態)

00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:49.160
Kyuukuma?
(Mistook the kanji for tai, 態 for kuma 熊, bear)

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:50.240
Kyuutai..

00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:53.900
Wa..wa...wa...wait..

00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:56.460
"Nisha"
(Two objects/people, 二者)

00:09:57.180 --> 00:09:57.680
"ken..."

00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:58.340
"Ninisha"

00:09:58.340 --> 00:09:59.540
"Nishatakuitsu"!
(Two options/choices between two alternatives, 二者択一)

00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:00.540
Nishatakuitsu means...

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:02.520
that two people...

00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:04.500
to avoid being bored...

00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:06.360
then...

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:08.540
they pretend to lick each other's wounds..

00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:10.080
That's what it's called..

00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:13.160
What do you think? I was in the right!
(Even though the explanation is false)

00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:14.560
"Nishatakuitsu"

00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:15.720
And now...

00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:20.960
And now...

00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:23.520
"Kyuutaiizen"
(Remain without change, 旧態依然)

00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:25.260
That means...

00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:27.320
that the previous situation...

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:29.680
The previous situation...

00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:32.340
remains the same, right?

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:34.600
Well, it means something like that, try to guess it

00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:36.120
Ooooh!

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:37.420
I guessed!

00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:39.300
I guessed

00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:40.540
I'm doing it, right?

00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:41.900
Let's see...

00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:44.960
"Meitetsumitsugo"...

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:47.800
"Kokkimitsugo"

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:49.400
"Kenryoumitsugo"

00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:51.120
"Kangenmitsugo"

00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:54.440
Good, I don't want to make a mistake

00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:56.160
I know the answer now..

00:10:56.340 --> 00:10:58.960
I know the answer but I want to be completely sure...

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:01.080
To avoid making a mistake..

00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:02.260
Let's see...

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.300
"Kangenhousei"

00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:05.680
That means...

00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:11.020
That although an item has been returned for being bland or boring...

00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:15.800
It can be arranged to make it a good gift

00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:20.100
That means, that it looks good from the outside, but on the inside is not so nice, right?

00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:20.940
*LYING*

00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:22.980
*Correct response: kenryouhousei 賢良方正, wise and virtuos*

00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:23.820
Good...

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:26.700
Eh...

00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:27.340
I...

00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:29.980
I said "kenryouhousei", right?

00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:30.900
Right?

00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:34.100
Of course, kenryouhousei means...

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:37.340
Then, a person who's good and intelligent...

00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:38.607
Then...

00:11:38.607 --> 00:11:41.600
Who's on the right path..
(Only uses the kanji to make up a definition)

00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:43.120
It means that there's only...

00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:46.940
"Kangenhoshin"!

00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:49.280
No, "meitetsuhoshin"
(Wise in the art of self-defense, 明哲保身)

00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:50.240
That means...

00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:52.460
protect with the body...

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:54.720
An iron made by a famous person
(She has no idea, XD)

00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:57.040
Ah!

00:11:57.240 --> 00:11:58.420
I guessed!

00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:00.040
"Meitetsuhoshin"

00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:01.640
What do you think?

00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:03.420
Only two left, right?

00:12:04.340 --> 00:12:06.220
I'll try to guess...

00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:07.480
"Kokkimitsugo"

00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:08.600
That means...

00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:12.220
the person being in a nation...

00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:20.460
They speaks with words from another country that they don't understand

00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:23.760
Aaaghhh!

00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:27.480
Then...

00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:29.660
I said "kangenmitsugo", right?
(Coax, 甘言蜜語)

00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:32.800
In that case, I'll explain anew what "kangenmitsugo" means..

00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:33.520
It means that...

00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:34.020
Well...

00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:36.680
You must not let yourself be carried away by flattering words

00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:37.560
Well, regardless...

00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:38.400
Good, good, good

00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:39.640
The only one left is...

00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:42.500
"Kokkifukurei"
(Behaving in accordance with the rules of etiquette and formality, 克己復礼)

00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:44.900
"Kokkifukurei" means...

00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:47.460
Then...

00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:49.740
Recuperate, revive...

00:12:50.780 --> 00:12:52.340
and to thank for that..

00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:56.400
It means, thank you very much for reviving A.I.Channel, right?

00:12:56.980 --> 00:12:58.560
Good, I did it perfectly!

00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:00.080
Thank you very much!

00:13:00.140 --> 00:13:00.640
Good!

00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:02.100
Good, regardless..

00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:06.080
I'll think about the kanji component to read it

00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:08.960
Well, at least I'll investigate it

00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:10.420
It's just that...

00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:12.680
As you may have understood when watching this video..

00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:17.880
I think I don't need a kanji plug-in

00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:19.520
What do you guys think?

00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:23.560
Well, basically you just need to continue to do kanji tests, right?

00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:25.140
I'll do it, I'll do it

00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:26.760
Look if you please..

00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:29.180
In a month, I think I can reach pre-level 1
(One level below the maximum)

00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:34.020
Well if I surrender level one, I think it will be too easy for me but...

00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:37.520
As you may know, if I solve it easily the video will be boring...

00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:39.980
So I plan to surrender pre-level 1

00:13:39.980 --> 00:13:40.960
Leave it to me

00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:44.840
After all, Kizuna AI is a very capable A.I, right?

00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:45.400
...

00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:46.680
Good, bye bye~!
