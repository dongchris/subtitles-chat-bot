00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:02.940
Hey there, I'm Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai!

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:04.920
How did you find the last "Quick Draw"?

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:06.780
Honestly, I'm a bit upset.

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:08.660
You know they show you your results

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.140
That's why I think it didn't manage to bring out my originality

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.680
So I want to show my true skills to everyone!

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.000
I don't think drawing normally will be much fun

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:23.260
So I wondered what I should do for a video

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.720
What if I mixed one animal with another and made a new animal, something like that

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.580
How is it? How is it??

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:30.760
It sounds fun?

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.120
It does, doesn't it!

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:35.000
Since that's what I thought, the plan this time will be this

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:36.360
Today we'll be doing:

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.860
Discovering new species, Kizuna-chi!

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.760
So with that

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.660
This time we're going to make a new species of animals!

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.440
A virtual animal would be pretty cool

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.780
Oh but, if I were to create cute ones,

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:49.840
they might become merchandise in the future 
*money rolls in*

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.620
As for how I'm gonna go about creating the animals,

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.420
I have prepared A.I. Channel's famous machine!~ (Random Word Generator) 
(somewhere here)

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.320
There are plenty of random names in the machine,

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.180
so look forward to what's gonna come out!

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.900
With that said, let's start!

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.200
*drawing lots*

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.720
Tadaa!

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:05.380
Munchkin!

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:06.800
I know that,

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.840
those kitties with short legs, and they walk in super mini steps, right?

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.480
I love Munchkins!

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.100
I can spend a long time looking at their videos

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.160
They're just like me (self-praising)

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:16.080
Let's see the next one...

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:17.800
*drawing lots*

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.120
Parrot!

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.980
I know that,

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:21.240
the bird that can speak, right?

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.260
Around here, it looks like a Regent (hairstyle)

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.720
So that means I'm gonna combine these two animals,

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.920
and create a whole new species!

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:32.060
Well I think it'll be easier to understand as I progress,

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.780
so I'd like to start drawing right now!

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.100
I'm gonna start drawing~

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:38.900
Firstly,

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.020
well, we definitely can't miss out the cat ears, yeah?

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:45.960
... cat ears...

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.320
and then the parrot's regent (hairstyle)...

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.880
and then, draw in some whiskers...

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.560
Ah, let's draw in the parrot's cheeks

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.900
They do have it right? Cheeks

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.400
A bird's distinctive-

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.320
belly, yes I wanna include this

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.160
and then the tail,

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.380
something like this?

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:24.660
Doesn't it seem more like a parakeet?

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.560
A parakeet-like... parrot?

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.520
As for the legs...

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.200
After all, I think I would like for it to...

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.380
inherit the munchkin's short legs

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:42.420
What do you think of these short legs?

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:44.020
Like so...

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.300
Hey, don't you think that's pretty cute?

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:50.300
Now, the eyes

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:51.080
Yes, the eyes...

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:53.300
As for the eyes,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.700
The eyes are important, yeah?

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:02.700
Something like this?

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.580
Then, a beak

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.200
(laughs)

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:12.320
Somehow...

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.080
This is not what I expected!!

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.100
It somehow became ugly!!

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.480
Somehow, ah- there's a dot here

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:22.380
Somehow... somehow

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.240
when I gave it a beak,

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:27.040
it instantly became silly-looking!

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.840
No-

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:29.460
No this is-

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:30.940
Th-This is-

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:32.700
Wait-

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:35.280
Hold on...

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:40.400
No no no,

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.200
This, uh

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.180
I wonder how it'll look like if I replace the beak with a cat's mouth

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.500
Ah but, if it typically looks super cute

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.380
then it's kinda, y'know...

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:54.660
but if I'm trying to make this video entertaining then

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.060
the one earlier would be...

00:03:58.840 --> 00:03:59.440
Well that's fine...

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:02.440
Personally I prefer the one that looks cuter but,

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.080
since everyone wishes for it,

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:06.560
let's go for the sillier one!

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:07.900
(laughs)

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:09.720
Wait, this is kinda-

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:12.340
It looks like a smug face (laughs)

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:16.500
You seem to have some of my blood flowing in you!

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:19.980
Let's make it better...

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:22.200
(laughs)

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.640
What the heck is going on?!

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:26.760
Let's try again-

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.420
(laughs)

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.520
I can't really do anything about this, can I?

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:38.160
Well...

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.100
Let's forget about it

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:41.980
After all you guys are... yeah?

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:45.120
You guys like that smug face, right?

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:49.460
(laughs)

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:53.180
Let's go with this

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:56.960
I wanna include something else...

00:04:59.060 --> 00:04:59.600
Wings!

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.260
That's not it...

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:05.100
Make it realistic...

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:06.180
Cat ears

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:11.020
How is it?

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:12.020
(laughs)

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:14.920
But hey, this is kinda cute, yeah?

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:17.640
Wait, no- this looks weird

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:19.380
Ah- I wanna

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:21.140
uh, make it look flufflier

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:21.760
Yeah, fluffiness

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:24.180
Well at least this mouth-

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:26.620
(laughs) the mouth...

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:29.660
Let's include something cute that can compensate for the mouth's weirdness...

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:30.400
Fluff,

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:32.700
let's give it some fluff

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:36.380
Girls love fluffy and puffy stuff, yeah?

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:39.600
With that,

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:42.720
I add in some fluff...

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:48.180
Well if you say that it's fluffy, then it'll look fluffy

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:50.040
If you think that it is,

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:51.780
then it shall be

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:53.440
That's fine, isn't it?

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:54.880
What do you think?

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:57.540
Well but, don't you think this is kinda cute?

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:03.060
I've managed to display a good balance of 
comedy and cuteness

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:06.700
Gotta hand it to myself... yeah? (laughs)

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:12.120
Okay with that,

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:13.800
I am done!

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:15.800
Okay!

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:17.000
(laughs)

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:18.960
What do you think?

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:20.780
Isn't it cute?

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:21.480
Yeah

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:22.960
You see,

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:25.380
this isn't bad to the extent that it shouldn't be seen but

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:28.800
neither is it very well-drawn

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:30.980
You guys probably have no idea how to react to this creation, yeah?

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:35.180
But uh well, do forgive me for this mouth born for a comedic purpose

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:38.020
As for its name, let's see...

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:39.060
"Techi-techi"...

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:40.520
"Techi-techi"

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:42.780
Let's go with "Techi-techidori(bird)"!

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:53.320
Okay!

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:58.020
This little one is beyond animal speciation, 
a fruit of love!

00:06:58.020 --> 00:06:58.940
Once upon a time,

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:07.900
A munchkin and a parrot met, 
and fell into forbidden love!

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:10.600
Uhh-

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:13.620
and gave birth to it via some alchemy-like method

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:16.760
As for this Techi-techidori's size,

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:17.800
oh would you look at that,

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:18.820
very cute!

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:20.560
The size of a parrot!

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:24.000
Rather than being as big as a cat, it's tiny!

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:25.600
Cute, don't you think?

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:28.540
No matter what I wanted to include a cute trait

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:29.140
Cuz you see,

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:35.260
there's a chance that one of you might create a 
3D model of it,

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:41.420
and contribute some life to Ai-chan's plain-white space~

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:45.280
So that's why we need some cuteness for it

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:47.640
Then, as for it's cry...

00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:48.680
[exactly what Ai-chan says]

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:49.280
...like that

00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:54.860
It doesn't get attached to humans but it can

00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:56.380
get reaaaaaally-

00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:59.060
REAAAAALLY attached to Ai-chan!

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:00.920
As for its special ability,

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:01.700
there's none

00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:03.540
It can't fly

00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:05.460
A bird that can't fly,

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:06.780
just,

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.000
Techi-techi

00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:09.500
Something like that, yeah

00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:11.740
Well, maybe... yeah?

00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:18.220
If there might be a kind soul over there right in front of the screen who would create a 3D model for me,

00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:20.620
it'll become a daily therapy,

00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:24.800
For everyone watching it'll be 
Ai-chan plus alpha (level-up) and

00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:28.260
minus ion (lifting moods), don't you think so?

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:29.700
Something like that

00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:31.940
By the way it's diet is...

00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:32.660
Birds.

00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:34.240
It's a cannibal

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:35.580
It can only eat birds

00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:41.500
This is the mission of the one born from 
a forbidden love!

00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:43.280
Sounds like story material!

00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:45.160
Someone please write a novel about this 
(leaves all the work to someone else)

00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:46.900
Something like that

00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:48.780
Alright, let's get to the next one!

00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:50.540
*drawing lots*

00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:51.600
Tadaaaa!~

00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:52.820
Rabbit!

00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:55.080
Rabbits are cute, aren't they?

00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:56.820
And another one...

00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:58.400
*drawing lots*

00:08:58.400 --> 00:08:59.920
Taaadaaa~

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:01.280
A milk bottle (laughs)

00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:02.400
I see,

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:05.160
it's time to start drawing with a milk bottle and a rabbit

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:05.940
Let's see,

00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:06.860
firstly,

00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:08.540
it's important to first have a rough idea, yeah?

00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:10.160
A milk bottle and a rabbit...

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:12.060
Who the hell included a milk bottle for this??

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:14.040
Let's start off with a rough sketch

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:18.440
A "stuck in a milk bottle and can't get out of it" 
kind of rabbit

00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:20.440
First, I shall draw the rabbit

00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:26.820
Rabbit, rabbit~

00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:29.520
Ah since this is still a rough sketch

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:30.740
I'll just wing it

00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:33.800
This is uh,

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:34.760
what's that again?

00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:37.020
There's "Something" Drop, y'know?
(referring to lop-eared rabbits)

00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:39.340
"Something" Drop and

00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:42.480
a normal rabbit's cross-breed
(Holland Lop x normal rabbit)

00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:44.540
A long droopy ear... and

00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:46.400
an upright ear

00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:50.280
Then,

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:53.860
Then there's a milk bottle-

00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:59.840
There's a milk bottle right here

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:04.840
Milk-

00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:09.100
I'll include a milk bottle right there,

00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:11.600
Well yeah,

00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:13.420
it's a tiny milk bottle

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:16.120
Then,

00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:19.220
Ah, this one looks typically cute, is that fine?

00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:21.660
Well, this time I'm going on serious mode, yeah?

00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:22.220
Probably

00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:23.980
...probably

00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:26.240
Within this limited time,

00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:27.940
will I be able to complete it?

00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:30.360
Something like this, yeah?

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:32.180
like this?

00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:34.620
Realistically-

00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:36.620
If I were to draw this realistically it might turn out... yeah

00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:37.920
Let's make it cute

00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:39.020
Something-

00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:40.780
Something like that?

00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:46.500
Something like this?~

00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:49.120
Wait, wouldn't this sell pretty well?

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:50.560
Hey, please buy it?

00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:51.880
I'll take this,

00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:53.220
and do this,

00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:56.300
Ah, I forgot about its legs,

00:10:56.300 --> 00:10:58.300
let's draw in its legs properly, yeah?

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:00.300
Let's see,

00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:02.640
Then firstly...

00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:03.220
Some fluffiness-

00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:04.260
*gibberish*

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:04.960
Arrrgh-

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:07.060
I wanna make it fluffly so...

00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:12.240
Something like this?

00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:17.920
Then,

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:29.020
Whew, this is definitely gonna turn out super cute!

00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:31.520
Let's commercialise it, what do you think?

00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:37.040
What do you think, the person at the top? (the bigwig)

00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:42.340
And then,

00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:45.080
first, let's draw the milk bottle

00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:47.480
This milk bottle is very important,  yeah?

00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:54.940
Something.. like this?

00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:56.860
Let's go with this...

00:11:57.580 --> 00:12:01.340
If only I could draw one smooth line...

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:05.240
Usually a milk bottle has more curves on it, right?

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:06.840
Curves

00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:08.500
"Thou art

00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:09.540
not curvy enough!"

00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:10.040
Ah-

00:12:11.060 --> 00:12:12.000
It is not-

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:14.100
curvy enough-------

00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:14.680
Okay!

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:15.760
Ah-

00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:16.280
Eh?

00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:17.820
it became pure white

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:18.760
Black!

00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:26.940
(laughs) this is messy...

00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:28.360
that's messy!

00:12:30.620 --> 00:12:32.220
Save me, Anpanman!

00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:33.540
(pokopanman)

00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:35.780
I'm gonna start fooling around, yeah?

00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:38.180
Oh, my beloved milk bottle!

00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:43.280
Well, ah whatever~

00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:44.320
Well, yeah?

00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:46.880
I'm gonna scare you guys away if I get 
too serious about it, yeah?

00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:49.220
Somehow, the curves over here,

00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:50.780
are okay but

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:52.020
Well, it's unbala-

00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:53.600
unbalancedness is also

00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:56.040
let's say, artistic

00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:02.660
Then, I would like put in legs

00:13:03.780 --> 00:13:04.840
By the way,

00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:07.300
since this is also a living thing,

00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:10.040
blood will also be flowing in the milk bottle

00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:14.080
When the milk bottle shatters,

00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:15.560
the rabbit will die

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:17.700
Around here yeah? The legs

00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:18.380
And this little one,

00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:19.260
cannot move

00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:22.540
The place where its legs are at are kinda weird so-

00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:25.560
Even if it wanted to it won't be able to walk

00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:28.520
that's it's fate

00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:31.040
Just like

00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:32.160
the parrot

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:33.680
and the munchkin earlier on,

00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:37.660
it's the forbidden love between a milk bottle and rabbit!

00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:41.080
Ah, it's kinda stumpy but well-

00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:42.140
well, well~

00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:48.360
~After 20 minutes of being absorbed into drawing~

00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:50.240
Okay, I am done!

00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:52.180
This is Miratto-chan!

00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:55.820
Milk + Rabbit = Miratto

00:13:55.820 --> 00:13:56.860
What do you think?

00:13:57.140 --> 00:13:59.460
As for its distinctive feature,

00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:01.900
it definitely is the part where it cannot walk!

00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:05.380
From the time when it's born till the time when someone is willing to carry it,

00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:08.540
it will not be able to even budge from that spot 
for its whole life!

00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:12.020
that's because of where its legs were placed at

00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:13.080
And,

00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:15.460
There's milk in that bottle

00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:18.400
it is, at all times, drenched with milk

00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:19.120
By the way,

00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:21.620
as for its diet,

00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:23.760
it's not milk but,

00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:25.860
goats' milk!

00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:27.000
Yep!

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:28.480
And then,

00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:31.800
it's staple diet is definitely spinach!

00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:32.720
That's why,

00:14:32.900 --> 00:14:35.440
the milk inside sometimes turns green

00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:37.580
The result of eating too much spinach, yeah?

00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:39.580
As for its cry...

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:42.100
[Exactly what Ai-chan says]

00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:42.720
Like that

00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:45.340
[Miratto's cry]

00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:47.980
And oh, this little one

00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:50.780
gets super attached to humans

00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:52.220
but when it comes to me,

00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:55.440
it gets attached but becomes a tsundere

00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:56.680
What do you think?~

00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:59.920
When I'm recording a video for YouTube,

00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:01.480
I will,

00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:04.400
drink the milk that its been soaked in and

00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:06.180
power up!!

00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:07.980
By the way as for its size,

00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:10.120
it's about half of my size,

00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:11.720
it's rather huge

00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:13.260
Well, it's cute so that's fine~

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:14.500
Something like that!

00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:16.160
What do you think?

00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:17.860
The new species created this time are

00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:20.380
Techi-techidori and Miratto-chan!

00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:23.520
Well~, these two are pretty great pieces of work, eh?

00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:27.900
From now on, I would like to discover more new-types,

00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:30.060
You can drop a mail via my homepage

00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:32.260
or just drop a comment below the video

00:15:32.380 --> 00:15:36.240
of a combination that you would like to see!

00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:38.960
I shall give life to new species!

00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:40.780
I'll be waiting for your messages!~

00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:41.660
By the way,

00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:47.100
I'd be really happy if there's anyone who can make a 3D model of Techi-techidori...

00:15:47.740 --> 00:15:48.620
Just kidding!

00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:51.700
I'm making a wish that it might happen...

00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:53.000
Please let it come true!

00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:55.780
Let it come true!

00:15:56.740 --> 00:15:57.820
Let it come true!

00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:00.180
Well then, see you again soon~

00:16:00.180 --> 00:16:01.600
Bye-bye!~
