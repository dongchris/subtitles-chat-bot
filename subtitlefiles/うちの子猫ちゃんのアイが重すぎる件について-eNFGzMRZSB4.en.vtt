00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:03.380
Hello everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai here!

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:07.280
Well... lately I've been having some worries...

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:11.060
It’s really tough being loved, right?

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:12.020
It's become a problem

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:13.420
Turns out that yesterday as well....

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:17.020
There was a quarrel in my harem

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:18.740
Gremory-chan: "Can you please explain to me?"

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:21.520
Gremory-chan: "Can you tell me about whom you are thinking of?"

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:22.380
Well...

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.540
If you are making me choose only one person, I can't make a harem, you know

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.280
Persephone-chan: "Do you want me?"

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.660
Persephone-chan: "If so, please try to snatch me away"

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:31.720
Eh... no...

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:32.640
Persephone-chan!

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:34.400
I haven't said anythi-

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.080
Nanna-chan: "Let's have a beautiful romantic love?"

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.520
Nanna-chan: "I'm rooting for you!"

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:38.560
Eh? Eh?!

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.360
Wait! Don't continue a story for your own convenience!

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:42.740
Nanna-chan: ”Untill my life runs out..."

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.440
Nanna-chan: "I will pray for you!"

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:46.820
No, that's too much, too much, too much!

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:48.420
Brunhild-chan: "Swearing by the name of the battle maiden..."

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.220
Brunhild-chan: "I won't lose!"

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.260
Parica-chan: "Don't you want to become my underling?"

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:55.660
Hermione-chan: "Please devote the victory to me"

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.240
Hestia-chan: "Hehehe"

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:58.660
Hestia-chan: "I seem to have gotten fired up"

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:59.440
Ahaaha...

00:00:59.440 --> 00:00:59.940
*inhales*

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:00.840
Girls, wait a second...

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:01.420
Well...

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:02.980
I appreciate your feelings, but...

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:04.180
Well, if you complicate...

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:06.220
The story like that-

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.400
Persephone-chan: "I hate liars"

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:09.960
Look, she’s mad now!

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.660
I’m scared when Persephone-chan gets angry!

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.420
Persephone-chan: "Let me lure you to the world of the dead"

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:19.260
You see?! I said it's bad, bad, bad!

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:20.880
Valkyrie-chan: "There is no need to worry"

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:22.340
Valkyrie-chan: "Because I have arrived!"

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:23.960
Well...

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:29.280
Because we only just.... met Valkyrie-chan, so I’m not sure if you’re trustworthy, right?

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:30.580
Belphegor-chan: *moans*

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:32.600
Belphegor-chan: "I slept so good~!"

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:35.100
Belphegor-chan: "I sort of don't want to work~"

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.100
So happy-go-lucky!

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:37.400
Don’t you see the situation we’re in?

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:38.600
Krishna-chan: "Such a bad child..."

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:42.060
Krishna-chan: "What would you even do if you were to disappear into the darkness?"

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.520
Eh? Wai- No!

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.220
There’s nothing yet between me and Persephone-chan!

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.860
Persephone-chan: "I hate liars"

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:49.720
Ehh?!

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.660
What kind of proven fact are you trying to establish?

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:54.960
Soul-chan: "Onii-sama is so impatient!"

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.660
No, I'm saying I didn't do anything yet!

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:59.960
Hestia-chan: "Are pranks not allowed?"

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.880
No, you already complicated things with what you said before!

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.700
Belphegor-chan: "Looks like I have no choice, I’m in a good mood so I'll play with you!"

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.700
As I said before, understand the situation we are in!

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.060
Gremory-chan: "I hope that the love in this world fills up!"

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.020
Your love is too heavy!

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.040
It was something like that

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.820
Although everyday they are very happy and fun with my noisy kittens

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:24.420
Look...

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:25.680
It’s still...

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:27.640
Not enough...

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:28.420
It’s for that, that...

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.420
I plan on making a guild!

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:32.960
Yaaaay!

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:34.320
Cha, chaaan!

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.660
I finished!

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.420
Well, like always, the name is…
*You can send a request to join after completing the tutorial!*

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.800
"Kizunazaka46"

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.760
♪ Humility! Goodness! Kizuna (Bonds)! ♪
*Words of encouragement used by Keyakizaka46*

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:46.500
And well...

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:47.880
In this occasion...

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.760
There exists certain conditions to join...

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.680
It has become extremely demanding

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:52.480
First!

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:55.020
It must be the avatar of a cute girl

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:56.320
You can be a guy with a girl avatar

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:57.080
And also...

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:58.240
Your groups...

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.620
Must be comprised of only adorable girls!

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:03.220
Those are the conditions

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.200
Doesn’t matter the power they have

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.900
I’ll only be accepting requests that meets those requirements

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:10.200
I count on you guys!
*I await your requests!*

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.200
So then those are the conditions, but...

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:13.700
I definitely...

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.440
Was thinking in wanting to demonstrate...

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.940
That I’ve gotten much better at playing this game

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:25.840
You know, I’ll get sad if you say: "I won’t enter her guild because Ai-chan is such a bad player"

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:26.640
Right?

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:30.060
Well, it’s a mission I already completed, but...

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:31.840
I’ll show you how I play!

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:33.600
In that case, let’s start at once!

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.840
Good!

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:35.900
Here I go!

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.560
It turns out that the fight against the boss is quite long, so then...

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:44.540
I plan on defeating minor enemies while trying to use the least amount of MP as possible!

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:46.400
Soiyaa!

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:49.020
Here I go!

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:54.700
Well, the minor enemies are a piece of cake

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:56.020
You see? There you go

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:00.280
It looks as if...

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:01.820
The dragon...

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:03.620
Has an afro, right?

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:14.780
These kinds of squares that’s found underneath the avatars and slowly increasing...

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:16.560
Are the skills...

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.660
It’s the cooldown time until the ability activates

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:20.740
They also appear under the enemy

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:22.460
If you coordinate both...

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:24.900
You can launch well your skills

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.100
As long as there are more squares and the waiting time is longer...

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:31.040
There exists...

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:33.340
The possibility that it’s a more powerful skill, so then...

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.340
Taking into account that you need to perform other actions, such as healing

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:42.460
First, the boss will place a barrier

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:47.360
There it is!

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:48.280
And later...

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:52.180
I have a class skill called "Barrier Breaker"
*If the boss places a barrier...*

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:52.680
*Use the Sorcerer’s calls skill "Barrier Breaker"*

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.040
And that way, you can destroy the barrier!
*Use the Sorcerer’s calls skill "Barrier Breaker"*

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.680
And that way, I can attack without holding back

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:09.160
The "Barrier Breaker" is important

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:15.620
Aaah!

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:17.620
Aahh, how scary, how scary, how scary...

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:25.180
Oh!

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:27.920
Don’t you think I’m doing well?

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:31.740
No, but I shouldn’t...

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:33.520
Lower my guard, I should do it only...

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:35.840
Around two more times, right?

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:41.040
And "Barrier Breaker" again

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:41.760
Toh!

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:43.600
Ah, it looks like a powerful attack is coming, so then...

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:46.800
I’ll take it to heal myself

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:49.660
*You can heal up to a second before you get a blistering attack*

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:50.920
I won’t die!

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:53.660
Ah, it looks really dangerous, right?

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:58.660
Knowing when it’s the moment to cure is very important, right?
*You should cure beforehand to avoid being in trouble*

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:00.080
*You should cure beforehand to avoid being in trouble*

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:03.800
Aaaahh...

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:08.080
No!

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:08.940
I can do it

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:09.920
I can do it!

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:15.000
Aaahh...

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:16.400
Just a bit more!

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:18.520
Good

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:21.800
And now it has a spell, so then...

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:26.000
I’ll use the skill "Soul Eater" to take it away...

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:27.040
And also...

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:30.520
I’ll steal it from him and use it for myself

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:33.120
Oh, it’s paralyzed!

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:35.280
Ah, well, this...

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:38.800
Just as healing exists, there’s also other powers...

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:40.580
How do I say it...

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:42.940
If you provoke an altered state in the enemy...

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:45.780
You can prevent it from doing its attacks

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:53.800
Ah!

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:55.860
It looks great!

00:06:57.660 --> 00:06:58.600
Good job! Good work!

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:04.680
Also, it looks like I still have plenty of MP, right?

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:06.740
Oh!

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:07.980
Just a bit more!

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:08.760
Good!

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:10.780
It’s still not finished, right?

00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:20.180
And now, now that I've gathered enough Musou, I’ll activate it!

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:20.800
Toiyaa!

00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:32.360
Very good!

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.200
Oh, how powerful!

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:37.660
Ah!

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:38.400
It doesn’t look good, right?

00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:40.180
I’ll use "Barrier Breaker"

00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:45.140
It’s about to make a powerful attack! I should cure myself!

00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:46.260
Good, good!

00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:56.820
*You should cure beforehand to avoid being in trouble*

00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:58.860
There’s only a little bit left, right?

00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:01.220
If I can surpass this...

00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:10.420
Oh, how cute!

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:16.180
It’s great, right? She had a nice butt

00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:19.880
Here I go

00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:22.100
Hey!

00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:24.180
Oh, it went down quite a bit of energy! Very good!

00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:24.880
*The music changed! Just a little more!*

00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:29.380
Valkyrie-chan!

00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:37.980
Soiya!

00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:38.720
Here I go!

00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:44.700
Good, I’ll use “Barrier Breaker”
*Before a blistering attack...*

00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:45.560
*You can use “Barrier Breaker” to cause a stun!*

00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:46.660
Here I go!
*You can use “Barrier Breaker” to cause a stun!*

00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:47.900
Ah! Ah!

00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:48.600
Hey...

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.920
Good, good, I have HP maxed out, right?

00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:55.400
Just a little more! Can I do it?

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:00.500
How do you like that!

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:07.100
Ha, ha, ha! Well, it’s so easy, right?

00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:08.860
How do you think...

00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:11.220
Of this elegant play of mine?

00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:13.840
That was a piece of cake, right?

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:18.240
By the way, I'm Sorcerer class

00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:23.700
And depending on your class, you can receive additional abilities for your character

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.540
Well, but now I'm intending to create my harem...

00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:30.320
So while I'm not adding characters of this type...

00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:34.420
But essentially, if I add characters that fit the Sorcerer type

00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:37.180
I'll get additional extra abilities and I’ll get stronger

00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:41.080
In short, cute is justice, right?

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:45.220
Mmm, today I also have a lovely view, a lovely view!

00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:47.400
After I’ve gathered guild members...

00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:51.380
I want to have fun together while gazing at the cute girls in the guild!

00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:54.500
I'll do my best to keep gathering more characters from now on!

00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:57.560
This has been Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai!

00:09:57.560 --> 00:09:58.500
See you later!

00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:02.560
