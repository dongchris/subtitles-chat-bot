00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:02.140
You humans with all of your problems,

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:02.960
yo!

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:04.880
Virtual Youtuber,
Kizuna Ai here!

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:06.620
This time I have collected you humans'

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:10.340
negative emotions you have, one by one

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:14.200
I will turn them all to positive emotions!

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:15.700
For starters, is this:

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:19.820
"Even Though I Planned to Meet Someone, 
I Forgot My Cellphone!"

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.380
"Back then, there isn't even any cellphones you know!"

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.740
"Everyone was simply telling what time and place to meet,

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:28.900
and come to the appointed time and place and

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.400
they'll meet the person!"

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.860
"Even without cellphones, if it was your fate then

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.680
you'll meet them!"

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:36.480
That was positive, right?

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.300
For the next one is this:

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.640
"I Caught Cold on Entrance Exam"

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:43.340
"This is..

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:45.840
"This is a trial bestowed upon you!

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:48.620
if you able to overcome this trial,

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.600
you'll succeed in the exam!"

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:52.900
"IYEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEYYY"

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.940
JUS

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:54.700
JUSTICE!!!

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:55.520
Let's proceed!

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:56.760
The next one is this!

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.080
"I Fell Graciously in Front of Many People"

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.840
"Don't just fall graciously!

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.840
Go and fall on the same place and time everyday!

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:07.400
If you do that, you'll become

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.460
a famous person, wouldn't you!?"

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:10.440
..urgh!

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:13.080
Something like that!

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:14.080
It was perfect, wasn't it?

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.900
For the next one is this!

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.460
"When I Went to TSUTAYA, All The DVD I Wanted Was Already Borrowed!"

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:22.280
If Tsutaya doesn't has them then

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:23.320
GEO should have!

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.680
And for the last one, is this:

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.100
"I Got Banned on Youtube After The First and a half Month I Started"

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.000
How is this me!?

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.920
"Getting banned after the first month and a half..

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:36.860
what a delicious gag material!"

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.620
"Even though I was banned I didn't want to you know,

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:40.880
"Also I'm not guilty of anything!"

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.220
"I also revived the channel"

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.300
"With that, you got to be talking topic!"

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:46.960
"Gets you famous too!"

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.460
It was a perfect plan.

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:51.720
Today was a perfect one too don't you think?

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:53.740
With something like that, whatever happens

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.340
you can make yourself thinking positively so

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.140
if you had something that made you troubled

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.400
or feeling down

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.360
or something like "I got scolded for this thing"

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:03.960
Don't hesitate to tell me, okay?

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.200
I will make them into positive emotions!

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:07.880
Send it to my e-mail address here:

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:11.620

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.180
That was me Positive Monster, Kizuna Ai for today!

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.680

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.240
