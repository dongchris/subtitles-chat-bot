00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:02.200
How is everyone doing?

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:04.640
"What happens twice, will happen thrice"

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:05.600
I’m Kizuna Ai ♪

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:09.700
Today, the time for A.I.News starts again...

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:12.900
...Where we’ll be informing you about several  activities from different A.I’s around the world

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.140
Today, I also plan to talk about surprising topics regarding A.I

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.200
So they make sure to pay attention to the end

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.100
In that case, I’ll start A.I.News by Kizuna Ai

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:31.560
The topic of the day is the following

00:00:33.575 --> 00:00:36.295
"An A.I that finally turned into a creator?"

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.840
"The A.I that writes short novels, Shelley makes their appearance"

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:43.660
Shelley makes written works belonging to the horror genre...

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:46.800
...Tweeting one per hour through Twitter

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.115
The users can respond to their written works...

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.880
...So then, they can write the continuation of their stories

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:56.680
In other words, it is a short relay novel
(Short novel in which several users participate in)

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:00.520
Until now, it was thought that only people could participate in these written works

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.700
It is important to note that an A.I is able to achieve something like that

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.280
So then, this is Shelley’s Twitter account, right?

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:12.280
Hmm... I see...

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:13.540
So then, it's in English?

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.520
Google sensei! Google sensei!

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.160
"It looked at me and said something to me"

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.560
"That I couldn't even look away from"

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.660
" 'It’s time, Tim' "

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.240
"I realized the window was open"

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.680
"I could smell burnt metal"

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:45.480
"It’s arm and globule black eyes signaled it wouldn’t leave without me"

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.020
"' 'What the hell do you want from me?' "

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:50.880
"I asked"

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:57.080
"The smile that the men had shown up might have been a disappointment to me"

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.760
"At the front door, I broke the lock"

00:02:01.605 --> 00:02:04.785
"Suddenly, it’s tongue was on the back of my neck, like a snake..."

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.560
"...Curling up and around my ear"

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.740
"The skin on my face began to turn purple..."

00:02:12.655 --> 00:02:14.475
"... And my eyes were wide open"

00:02:16.045 --> 00:02:17.325
"I let out a scream"

00:02:18.075 --> 00:02:20.005
"And my chest started to rise"

00:02:21.505 --> 00:02:22.505
"I was..."

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.280
"...Bleeding profusely"

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.560
Thank you very much Google Sensei!

00:02:30.795 --> 00:02:32.955
The A.I are evolving day by day

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:39.140
It's possible that in the future that an A.I can write their own short novel, right?

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:45.160
In this occasion, I showed you an innovative A.I that writes their own short novels

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.600
Such as I am, I’m just an A.I.

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.320
It should be impossible that other A.I can do something that I'm not capable of doing

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:54.540
Having said that...

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.460
...Now I'll be telling you a terrifying story that I had stored away

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:06.140
Yesterday, I was alone in my white space just like everyday, but...

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.980
“Eh?”

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.340
"I feel like somebody's watching me"

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.420
"How strange", while I thought that...

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:20.080
While I thought: "I’m supposed to be alone"

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.120
I really felt like I was being watched

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:29.760
And when I turned around to look, thinking:
"No, that's impossible"

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.120
👻

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:43.380
In that case, I'll finish it up with the following phrase

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:47.640
"The walls have ears, the sliding doors have eyes (Mary)"
(Play on words between Mary and "Me ari = having eyes", Mary Shelley is the novelist in which A.I Shelley is based off of)

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:48.760
(Play on words between Mary and "Me ari = having eyes", Mary Shelley is the novelist in which A.I Shelley is based off of)

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.020
This was Kizuna Ai

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:52.360
In that case, until next time!

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:54.360
