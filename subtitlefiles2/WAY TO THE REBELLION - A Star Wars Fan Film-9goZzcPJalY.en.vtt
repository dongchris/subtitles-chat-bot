00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:56.920
It's some kind of (?)

00:00:58.820 --> 00:00:59.720
(?) seen one like this

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.760
You okay?

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:07.220
Yea

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.600
Look I had no idea that thing was following me, i swear.

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.720
Kit, what'd you do this time?

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.960
Nothing!

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:18.520
I was taking a shortcut through Glenicks point and i saw something in the forest,

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:19.840
some kind of,

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:20.760
mining station.

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.660
No there's nothing up there but dirt and rock. OK if there was, I would know about it.

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.040
No, that's the thing,

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.520
I don't think anybody is supposed to know about it.

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.840
Look.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.400
What's the Empire looking for here?

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.260
The same thing that I've been looking for.

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.200
One of these fell off the transports that i was following,

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.620
It has almost the exact same energy signature as the crystals of Ilum.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:57.620
I don't know,

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.980
are you still reading those Jedi folktales?

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:03.460
Didn't I tell you not to let that stuff get to your head?

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:06.400
Look I haven't tested it yet but i have a feeling that one of these could power-.

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:07.360
A lightsaber?

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.740
Kit, look, you can work on your little science experiments all you want, OK, but this is too far.

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:14.860
Who knows what kind of danger you've put us in?

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.340
Don't you want to know what the Empire is doing with these?

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:18.800
We have to go back!

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:20.360
And then what?

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.220
If the Empire is really here,

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:24.700
I want to make sure we're not.

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.420
OK, we have to figure out how to get off of this rock.

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.620
We can't just run away.

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.300
Even the outer rim territories have been occupied.

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:34.960
How do you know that?

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:38.320
I scanned the transmission from an Imperial freight ship.

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.600
The Empire is expanding.

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:43.340
Merek,

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:45.100
I've been thinking,

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.760
we should join the Rebellion.

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.660
Kit, I don't know what to tell you,

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.080
but that's not our fight.

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:07.600
Are you sure this isn't just another one of his stories?

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:12.200
Yea Kit has a wild imagination, but I don't think he'd make this up.

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.400
I saw the recording, they were Stormtroopers.

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.940
I don't like this, it's not safe there.

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.380
Look, Rina, don't worry.

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:22.200
OK,

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.740
I'm going to make it to Alderaan as soon as I can.

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:26.980
How much longer?

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:31.420
Well getting a transport, that's quick,

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.400
but paying for it is another story.

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:37.060
I don't know,

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.560
maybe another month?

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.660
It still feels so far away.

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.340
I can't wait to see you.

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:45.420
I'll figure something out

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:32.660
You know that doesn't make you a Jedi, right?

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:34.440
It works.

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:37.060
The crystal works.

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:41.980
Kit, you remember how to get back to that mine?

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.600
Yea, but i thought you said that-

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:47.700
Yea i know what i said,

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:49.740
But we can't stay here.

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:54.220
OK if the Empire sent that probe, it means they're still looking for us.

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.760
Then why do you want to go back to the mine?

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:02.180
If those crystals are as rare as you say they are,

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:04.520
they might be our ticket out of here.

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:05.760
Wait,

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:07.900
you want to steal from the Empire?

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:12.860
Its the only way to pay for a transport.

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:18.080
Get your stuff together, we're not coming back here.

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:48.480
Looks like this side has the least amount of security,

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:50.660
on the other side of that barricade is the mine.

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:00.820
Alright, so if i distract those two do you think that you could get in?

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:03.080
Yea, I think so.

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:04.340
Good.

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:11.040
As soon as you see a chance, go for it, but remember to stay out of sight and don't do anything-

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:13.440
Yea, don't worry, i got this.

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:43.220
(Music plays from hologram)

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:36.700
(Music continues playing)

00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:11.080
Freeze!

00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:14.620
Drop the case and turn around slowly.

00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:42.380
Stupid kid.

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.980
Did you get them? Yea, lets go!

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:18.160
We have a problem.

00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:21.000
Stop right there.

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:22.920
On your knees.

00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:31.100
You're trespassing on Imperial property,

00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:33.080
Identify yourself.

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:39.560
Identify yourself!

00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:48.040
Kit, lets go. Come on, lets go!

00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:01.700
Wait, wait, wait, you OK?

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:03.920
What happened?

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:06.960
Alderaan's gone, how is that possible?

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:11.240
I don't know.

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:14.180
Rina.

00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:21.860
Rina, come in.

00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:26.040
Rina, are you there?

00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:55.300
I don't get it,

00:10:55.300 --> 00:11:00.400
I'm scanning transmissions sent to that mining station, and it sounds like they knew it was going to happen.

00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:01.880
Like it was planned.

00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:08.440
You're right Kit,

00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:14.200
I don't want to believe it, but the Empire is expanding.

00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:18.980
In ways we can't even imagine.

00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:25.300
So what do we do now?

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:29.460
We join the fight.

00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:31.720
You mean the Rebellion?

00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:35.100
Lead the way.
