You do want a photo?
W-wong fu! Never

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.940
You sure want me to seeing the moment like the breakups? Like a guy a girl then the

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.380
I feel like this should be bigger

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:44.380
It's already pretty big

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:46.380
This feels familiar

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.100
Guys!

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.010
We're old I have had this here since I was 14

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:55.120
leave me alone Phil what's wrong we just

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:56.440
celebrate our 10-year anniversary I

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.090
think it's time we did something new to

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:00.460
keep ourselves fresh for the fans

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.080
makes sense I know right thing about

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:03.580
every artist has to reinvent themselves

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:05.800
after a few years Christina went dirty,

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.860
Justin went sexy, Brittany went crazy, Bieber

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.470
hit puberty, Madonna, Janet they all had

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:13.600
to do it. Chris Brown's starting hitting

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.600
girls I don't want to hit girls
 no but

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.360
even movies have reboots origin stories

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.030
those are in how about we introduce a

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:24.720
new member of Wungfu productions 
yes

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.300
that's a great idea or an old member

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:35.380
I think it's time to call Greg (gasps!)

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:36.840
Wow

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.640

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:49.160
Nice door!

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:50.320

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:51.520
him how awesome it is to be part of

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:52.509
wongfu and I'm sure he'll come
