00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:02.180
*Wong Fu Productions*

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:10.220
Our planet, is home to 30 million plants and animals.

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:13.460
Each with a unique story of survival.

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:17.680
Each committed to a lifelong search for food, for shelter

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.700
and

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.780
for companionship.

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:27.680
A cool mist fills the valley, marking the end of another autumn day, but for these three males,

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:32.780
things, have just commenced. It's the fifth day of the week, therefore it's boys' night

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.200
*Electronic chime*

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:43.020
An electronic chime startles a member of the pack, a signal that someone is attempting to communicate with him

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:53.680
But this is not an ordinary someone, by the expression on his face the two companions know, it's someone...

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:54.860
special.

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:56.360
*Upbeat music plays*

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.800
Meanwhile that lady friend and her two companions are having, girls night.

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:12.080
The edges of her mouth move upward and blood fills her cheeks, the two friends take notice and

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:17.880
Instinctively swarm towards the device with extreme curiosity and disregard for privacy.

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.460
Her desire for a partner comes at no surprise.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.160
It's quite common this time of year because it's the season of holidays

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.939
Also known

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:29.939
As cuffing season

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:36.059
It's a time for ceremonious reunions, which also serves to remind people of how lonely they actually are

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:43.228
Cold winter nights coupled with  prolonged indoor activity, sparks the desperate need for the warmth of a partner.

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:54.879
Gatherings consisting of holiday hymns and beverages made from animal lactate and fermented grass

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.540
Provide the perfect ingredients for a spark!

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:08.940
A celebratory exchange of fist bumps, flailing arms, and high shrieks signify the approval of the new union

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:17.940
Except, for Suzy lee, who has had a secret admiration for the male and now, has lost all hope.

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.079
The festivities continue into the night

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:32.110
Little do they know, as the winter days get shorter, and their love grows deeper, this can only lead to one thing

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.580
They are making the transition from dating

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:38.580
to hiberdating.

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.000
Trevor: Like hibernation

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:47.349
Hiberdating, is when a member of the pack finds a new mate, they become so exclusive that

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.730
They forget all their other friends.

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:51.460
They practically disappear.

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:53.260
The two friends grow more concerned

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.540
as they begin to experience the first signs of hiberdation

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:04.340
Their comrade hasn't responded to their last two texts and neither of them have seen him in four weeks.

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:09.680
Their pocket computers reveal that he isn't responding because he's at a football game.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000
A game the boys were planning on watching together

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:15.960
*Monkey sound effects*

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:23.100
The females faced similar challenges on their side. Girls night has been reduced to a party of two.

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:28.540
The two friends unexpectedly run into the couple at dinner and they suddenly realize

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.940
that girls night has been replaced, with date night.

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:38.900
*Animal growling noises*

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:45.000
the pack tries to re-adjust to a normal way of life, but it proves to be much easier said than done.

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.489
He, was always the tip master.

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:59.650
She, was always needed for the best coupon deals.

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.370
The couple prepares for the dead of winter,

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:09.879
by prepping their den and stocking up their queue with TV shows for extensive binging.

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:14.290
Meanwhile, the rest of the pack is left out in the cold.

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:22.689
The friends have weathered many days of neglect together, but none compares to the most dreadful day of the season,

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:25.750
Valentine's day.

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:32.300
With hunger and thirst at the highest levels, the friends begin to scavenge for their own partners.

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:37.040
The friends approach and get rejected left and right

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:39.040
Desperation is truly at its peak.

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:53.540
For the couple however, love, is at its peak. Their relationship has been going well,

00:04:54.099 --> 00:04:56.099
but where is it going next?

00:04:56.349 --> 00:04:58.379
Things, are getting serious

00:04:59.349 --> 00:05:00.639
maybe...

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:02.640
Too... serious?

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:14.500
As the weather warms the two realize that they have less need for one another

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:25.280
With day clubs back open, and spring break trips right around the corner the couple's commitment to each other begins to waver.

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:33.070
The sun rises on a new day

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:35.410
flowers begin to bloom

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:38.200
Birds return home after a long migration

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.000
and the mammals emerge from their dens, weak and disoriented.

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:49.270
They have broken up.

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:54.819
The male wanders the streets and wonders where it all went wrong.

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:01.054
The female questions if she'll ever find 'The one'.

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:03.720
Will she forever, be alone?

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:07.740
But not all hope is lost for the weak.

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:14.469
For on the horizon he sees his loyal friends approaching!

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:32.450
It's like they were never gone. Good friends are always there for one another.

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:36.350
They're faithful,

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:40.280
supportive, and ready to do it all over again!

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:52.340
Especially, Suzy Lee, who after weathering a brutal winter is now, back in the game! ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

00:06:55.120 --> 00:07:00.000
Philip: What's up guys, we all know we have those friends that as soon as they get into relationship they disappear!

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:04.380
Taylor: Yeah so you should send this video to those friends and let them know that you miss them.

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:08.680
Philip: Yeah. Thanks so much to Skype for partnering with us on this video we've been wanting to make this video

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:14.660

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:17.260
Taylor: Lunch Break. Philip: Yeah! So, we finally did it!

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:20.300
Taylor: And you might have noticed in the short that we have some new winter merch!
