00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:02.720
Hello everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai here!

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:05.320
Today, I’ll be playing "Furare Kaihi"!
(Break-Up Dodge)

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:07.020
There's only 2 stages left!

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:09.340
I’ll keep advancing until the 10th stage!

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:11.080
In that case, let’s start at once!

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:16.300
Man, I wonder what kind of ridiculousness is waiting for me in this occasion

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:18.660
*9th Stage: Betrayal*

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:19.300
"Betrayal"!

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:25.320
"You’re 100 times more adorable than that actress ♥"

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:27.040
Of course not!

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:28.860
*GF: In that case, should I become an actress? ♥*

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:29.740
"In that case, should I become..."
*GF: In that case, should I become an actress? ♥*

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:31.060
These two are incredible

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:32.680
*BF: You can’t ♥ After all, I’m the only one allowed to kiss you ♥*

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:33.200
BF...

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.780
*laughs*

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:35.660
*inhales*

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.200
Come on, kiss her at once

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.160
*GF: Oh, BF... ♥*

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:40.420
*BF: I’ll go shower ♥*

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:41.800
Ah, he’s going to go kiss someone!

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:45.380
*GFF: I love you too ♥*

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:48.400
He ruined it, he doesn’t take it seriously, does he?
*BF: I forgot my pho... I mean, I forgot to give you a kiss...*

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:49.700
*GF: …I need you to explain to me about something*

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:50.340
Yes!
*GF: …I need you to explain to me about something*

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:50.840
*GF: …I need you to explain to me about something*

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:52.460
Eh, let’s see...

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.100
Well, it turns out, that...

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:56.900
*GF: What does this message mean?*

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.500
To tell you the truth, I did this last time, but...

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.160
I wasn’t able to clear it...

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.120
So then I plan to play the rematch

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:06.160
Well...

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.040
"Don’t you believe in me?"

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.700
*BF: Don’t you trust me?*

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:12.960
Of course

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.840
*GF: It’s not about whether I trust you or not, it’s about the message*

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.020
"With "I love you too ♥", it wouldn’t refer to me in particular"

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:24.320
*BF: With "I love you too ♥", it wouldn’t refer to me in particular"

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.120
*GF: Then who was she referring to with the message "I love you too ♥"?*

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.300
But in this case, if she opens the message, I’ll be done for, right?

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:33.100
Eeehh...

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:35.960
Is it the alpaca?

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:37.680
*BF: "I love you too (alpaca) ♥", I think she was referring to alpacas*

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:39.000
Ah! Oh! Oh?
*GF: It’s true, she does like alpacas, I see*

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:39.620
*GF: It’s true, she does like alpacas, I see*

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:40.560
Oh! Eh?
*GF: It’s true, she does like alpacas, I see*

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:42.700
*GF: Did you just do a victory pose?*

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.780
Why are you doing a victory pose?!
*GF: Did you just do a victory pose?*

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:45.540
*GF: Did you just do a victory pose?*

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:47.700
Aaaahhh!

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.760
"Let me see your LIME"
*GF: Let me see your LIME*

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:54.640
I already answered both before

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:55.940
"I’m sorry, I should go to the bathroom..."

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:58.580
"Leave the cellphone here"

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:59.200
*GF: Leave the cellphone here*

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.720
"Leave" Mmm...

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:02.420
*BF: O-of course!*

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.940
*BF: I’m sure the phone is locked, so then I’m not worried that she can check it*

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:06.220
"I’ll go to the room to think"

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:07.560
Oh!

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.840
You know...

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.180
Now I can check the messages from the laptop
*BF: I got it!*

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:15.820
Ah, look! I did it!
*GFF: I love you too ♥*

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:18.660
*BF: I’ll contact GFF over LIME from my laptop to ask for help*

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.060
Her LIME messages will go to my cellphone, right?

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.300
*I want you to send a message saying: “You really love your girlfriend, right? ♥"*

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.700
*Could you call my girlfriend urgently?*

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.840
Eeeehh? "Could you call my girlfriend...?"
*Could you call my girlfriend urgently?*

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.280
I suppose I’ll choose this

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.400
*Could you call my girlfriend urgently?*

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:38.700
*GFF: Did she find out about us?*

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:39.860
Aaaaahhhh!
*GFF: Did she find out about us?*

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.000
I’m sure that already got sent to the pho...!

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.560
Aaaahhhh!

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:45.620
*inhales*
*GFF: Did she find out about us?*

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:46.680
You’re an idiot!
*GFF: Did she find out about us?*

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:49.500
*footstep noises*

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.900
I’m done for

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:51.560
*GF: You damn treacherous bastard*

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:53.520
I’m sorry, really

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.340
Let’s return to the last choice!
*Excuse Failed*

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:58.820
"You really love your girlfriend, right? ♥"

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:59.800
Yes, I’ll choose this, mmm...

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.080
*I want you to send a message saying: “You really love your girlfriend, right? ♥"*

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.040
*GFF: You really love your girlfriend, right? ♥*

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.800
Ah! Ah! Did I get it?
*GFF: You really love your girlfriend, right? ♥*

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.160
*GFF: You really love your girlfriend, right? ♥*

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.800
Ooohh!

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.740
Oh?

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:17.760
Oh! I did it! I did it! I did it!
*BF: Oh, I’m sorry for making you wait*

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:18.660
*BF: Oh, I’m sorry for making you wait*

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:19.680
*GF: You were being affectionate with me, right?*

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:20.640
Of course
*GF: You were being affectionate with me, right?*

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.560
Wasn’t it obvious?
*BF: That’s right, I hid it because I felt ashamed, I’m very sorry*

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.620
*BF: That’s right, I hid it because I felt ashamed, I’m very sorry*

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:25.700
*GF: Yes, you make me very happy... ♥♥*

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.300
I did it! I did it very... very fast!

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:30.720
It was to be expected

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:32.320
I can definitely comprehend...

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:33.840
A woman’s heart, right?

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:34.640
Good!
*10th Stage: Betrayal 2*

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.840
In that case, I’ll start with the last level!
*10th Stage: Betrayal 2*

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:38.640
Hoi!

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.920
Aahhh...

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:41.380
*BF: The fresh pasta here is delicious*

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:42.820
"The fresh pasta here..."

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:45.380
"Is delicious" Eh?
*GFF: Hehe... I’m happy that you brought me here ♥*

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:48.660
Hadn’t he gone to a store that served delicious pasta?

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:50.400
It’s not the same store

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:52.760
"Ah, I can’t wait any longer"
*BF: Ah, I can’t wait any longer*

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:53.860
*GFF: Man, you really are that hungry?*

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:54.360
*BF: I wasn’t referring to that*

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.860
AAAHHH! THAT’S NASTY! REALLY!
*BF: What I can’t wait for, is to kiss you*

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:58.140
AAAHHH!
*BF: What I can’t wait for, is to kiss you*

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.940
Not only are your words nasty, your actions are too!

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.040
This... why do they do this?!

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.040
Aaaahh! That behind them is dangerous!

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:07.860
I like your face

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:09.680
"What are you doing?"
*GF: What are you doing?*

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.200
"Please forgive me!!! I’ll do what you ask!!!"

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:16.660
*BF: Please forgive me!!! I’ll do what you ask!!!*

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:17.880
I’m sorry
*GF: No, I won’t forgive you*

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:21.860
"I didn’t have a choice"

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:23.760
*BF: I didn’t have a choice*

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:24.700
*GFF: Man... Did you really dislike kissing me that much?*

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:25.820
Aaahh...
*GFF: Man... Did you really dislike kissing me that much?*

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:29.280
"I didn’t dislike it"

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:31.240
*BF: I didn’t dislike it*

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:33.120
*GF: Ah? Was it not that you didn’t have a choice? Damn demon*

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:33.620
Ah

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:35.560
It’s true

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.440
Well, that turned out like I expected

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:41.260
Well, you know, I was just warming up

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:42.140
Right?

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:42.940
*GF: What are you doing?*

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:44.200
"Mmm? We’re eating, eating"

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:45.420
Eating!

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:46.340
*BF: Mmm? We’re eating, eating*

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:50.140
*GF: That wasn’t the only thing you were doing, right?*

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:52.020
"Yes, it wasn’t the only thing we were doing"

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:53.660
*BF: Yes, it wasn’t the only thing we were doing*

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:55.120
*GF: Are you admitting that you both were kissing?*

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:56.580
"You’re mistaken!"

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:58.220
*BF: You’re mistaken!*

00:04:58.220 --> 00:04:59.140
You’re mistaken!

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:00.120
*GF: In that case... *

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:01.260
Well...
*GF: What were you doing?*

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:03.300
Went back to the start, right?

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:06.720
"Eh? We weren’t doing anything" Mmm?

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:07.600
*BF: Eh? We weren’t doing anything*

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:09.520
*GF: No! You both were about to kiss!*

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.660
That was a prank!
*BF: That was a prank!*

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:14.920
"We surprised you!!!" ♪ Te, te, reen ♪
*BF: We surprised you!!!*

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:16.500
*GF: Heavens, don’t scare me like that, BF!!!*

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:17.720
*GF: Did you think I’d say something like that?*

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:19.440
*GF: I won’t settle with that being a prank, our relationship is over*

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:21.320
I’m very sorry

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.560
Mmm...
*GF: What were you doing?*

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:24.980
"Eating!"

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:26.400
"We were eating"

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:26.920
*BF: Mmm? We’re eating, eating*

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:28.260
*GF: That wasn’t the only thing you were doing, right?*

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:29.980
"We were about to call you!"

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:31.500
*BF: We were about to call you!*

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:32.280
*GF: Just now?*

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:33.340
*BF: It’s about to arrive...*

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:34.600
"Ah?" What’s about to arrive?
*GF: Ah?*

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:36.660
Is it her birthday?

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:39.980
*Customer 1: Eh? It can’t be!  It’s for me!?*

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:40.520
*Customer 2: Congratulations ♥ Come, blow out the candle ♥*

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:41.720
It’s not that...
*Customer  2: Congratulations ♥ Come, blow out the candle ♥*

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:44.480
*BF: It looks like that person is celebrating their birthday!*

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:46.380
It’s not that

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:48.520
*GF: Want me to blow out the candle of your life?*

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:49.380
It’s true

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:52.700
Well, it’s probably not good for you to blow the candle of his life

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:53.860
*GF: What are you doing?*

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:56.980
"Please forgive me!!! I’ll do what you ask!!!"

00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:58.500
Well...
*GF: No, I won’t forgive you*

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:00.420
"We didn’t kiss yet!!!"
*GF: No, I won’t forgive you*

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:01.960
*BF: We didn’t kiss yet!!!*

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:03.860
"Holding"
*GF: But you two were holding hands*

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:05.860
"I won’t hold them anymore!!!"

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:07.180
*BF: I won’t hold them anymore!!!*

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:07.780
*GF: Even if you say that, I’m sure you’ll see her again*

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:08.780
"I won’t see her again!!!"
*BF: I won’t see her again!!!*

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:09.440
*GF: I don’t believe you*

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:11.120
"Look, I deleted her from LIME!"
*BF: Look, I deleted her from LIME!*

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:11.900
But then...
*GF: You could re-add her at any moment*

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:15.620
Don’t you feel pity for the girlfriend behind him?
*GF: You could re-add her at any moment*

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:17.980
Isn’t she your girlfriend?

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:19.980
"You could re-add her at any moment"

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:21.220
Ouch!

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:22.620
*BF: Well, I broke it!*

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:24.700
"You like her, right?"
*GF: Even then, you like her, right?*

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:28.900
"Well, now I hate her! I don’t want to touch her! Don’t get any closer to me!"
*BF: Well, now I hate her! I don’t want to touch her! Don’t get any closer to me!*

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:30.600
That’s way too rude...

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:34.560
"Can you forgive me?"
*BF: Can you... forgive me?*

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:35.780
I think so!

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:36.900
Oh!

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:38.760
*GF: Good, I’ll forgive you, although I won’t see you again!*

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:42.460
Well, she’s in the right, isn’t she?

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:44.400
Eh? But this was the correct one

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:46.980
It’s correct for the girl

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:47.940
Absolutely correct

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:50.060
"Eh? We weren’t doing anything"
*GF: What were you doing?*

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:51.500
*BF: Eh? We weren’t doing anything*

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:53.920
*GF: No! You two were about to kiss!*

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:55.880
"No, no, no, no, no, you’re mistaken!"

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:56.920
No!
*BF: No, no, no, no, no, you’re mistaken!*

00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:00.000
*GFF: Eh? Wasn’t it a kiss?

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:02.160
It wasn’t a kiss! It wasn’t a kiss!

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:03.760
*BF: No, no, no, it wasn’t a kiss!!*

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:04.740
*BF: I don’t do that kind of stuff in public

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:06.440
"Your faces were nearly glued"
*GF: Ah? But your faces were nearly glued*

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:07.120
Nearly glued *laughs*

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:09.320
"Examining..."

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:11.380
Mmm...

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:17.780
I suppose she was examining his bad breath

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:19.820
*BF: D-don’t be ridiculous! She was checking my bad breath*

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:21.700
BF: I wouldn’t want bad breath when I kiss you*

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:22.580
I see

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:24.060
*BF: I asked your friend for the favor*

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:27.080
"Now that you say it, well..." Will she say that it stinks?
*GFF: Now that you say it, well...*

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:28.060
*BF: Eh?*

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:29.740
*GF: So then you have bad breath even though you usually replace the toothbrush right after?*

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:30.820
Ah!
*GFF: A guy with bad breath is something...*

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:31.500
*GF: Yes...*

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:34.020
Aahhh...

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:38.880
What was the saying? "If you run after two hares, you will catch neither"?

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:40.420
Although I feel it’s not quite like that
*I was right*

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:42.040
Eh? That’s enough, that’s enough!

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:44.020
You’re so annoying, that’s enough
*GF: What are you doing?*

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:46.180
I don’t want to turn into a man like him!

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:47.720
"I’ll do what you ask!!!"
*BF: Please forgive me!!! I’ll do what you ask!!!*

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:48.560
*GF: No, I won’t forgive you*

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:50.740
"She wasn’t about to kiss me, but instead another one of my personalities"

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:51.760
Whatever, I’ll choose this

00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:55.280
*GF: This is the first time I’ve heard of you having multiple personalities*

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:56.240
"Guaaahh!!"

00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:57.440
*Guaah!! Another personality is taking possession of me!!*

00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:59.260
"Another personality..."
*Guaah!! Another personality is taking possession of me!!*

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:00.680
Changing!

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:04.160
*BF: Nice to meet you, miss, who are you?*

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:05.300
He’s way too forced
*BF: Nice to meet you, miss, who are you?*

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:08.900
"Nice to meet you, miss, who are you?"
*GF: Nice to meet you, I’m BF’s ex-girlfriend*

00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:10.060
*GF: Nice to meet you, I’m BF’s ex-girlfriend*

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:13.060
That was way too forced

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:15.140
Let’s return to the last choice

00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:16.760
"I didn’t want..." Right?
*I hid it because I didn’t want to worry you, I have 4 different personalities in total*

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:20.060
I definitely didn’t want to worry you, it’s that
*I hid it because I didn’t want to worry you, I have 4 different personalities in total*

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:21.940
*BF: I hid it because I didn’t want to worry you, I have 4 different personalities in total*

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:23.240
*BF: Yuuki, the careless*

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:25.040
"Yuuki, the careless"
*BF: Yuuki, the careless*

00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:26.920
"Masaki, the serious"
*BF: Masaki, the serious*

00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:28.800
"Yoshiki, the carefree"!
*BF: Yoshiki, the carefree*

00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:31.180
"And lastly..." Hah! She has a point
*GF: And lastly, BF, the treacherous, right?*

00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:35.020
"What are you doing?" That’s enough!
*GF: What are you doing?*

00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:36.160
"Eating"!

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:38.100
*Ouch!*

00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:41.380
*GF: Are you betraying me with my friend!? Don’t you feel that that’s wrong?*

00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:41.880
*BF: What was wrong is that you presented her to me*

00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:42.500
*GF: Are you saying it’s my fault!?

00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:43.460
Hehehe...
*GF: Are you saying it’s my fault!?

00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:45.340
I’ll choose this option
*It’s God’s fault, causing mischief by moving the gears of destiny ☆*

00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:46.720
"It’s God’s fault"
*It’s God’s fault, causing mischief by moving the gears of destiny ☆*

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:48.820
*BF: It’s God’s fault, causing mischief by moving the gears of destiny ☆*

00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:49.540
*GF: Well, here goes my greeting to God*

00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:52.540
Aaahhh, that hurt

00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:54.480
That was very...

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:56.760
Very beautiful, right?

00:08:57.100 --> 00:08:58.940
Eeeeehhhh?

00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:01.320
"What are you doing?"
*GF: What are you doing?*

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:04.200
"Please forgive me!!! I’ll do what you ask!!!"

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:05.440
I'm tired
*BF: Please forgive me!!! I’ll do what you ask!!!*

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:06.540
*GF: No, I won’t forgive you

00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:07.720
Eeeehh...

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:09.400
"I didn’t have a choice"!

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:11.240
*BF: I didn’t have a choice*

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:11.940
*GFF: Man... Did you really dislike kissing me that much?*

00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:13.460
"Yes, that’s right"
*GFF: Man... Did you really dislike kissing me that much?*

00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:14.800
*BF: Yes, that’s right*

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:15.800
"What do you mean...?"
*GF: What do you mean you didn’t have a choice?*

00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:17.680
*GF: What do you mean you didn’t have a choice?*

00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:21.300
"It was just an impulse, you’re the only one in my heart"

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:23.060
*BF: It was just an impulse, you’re the only one in my heart*

00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:23.560
*GF: Well, for me, there’s no-one*

00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:24.500
It’s true...
*GF: Well, for me, there’s no-one*

00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:25.900
Yes, I understand

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:27.920
She’s in the right, absolutely right

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:30.240
"Please forgive me!!!" Really!

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:31.120
*BF: Please forgive me!!! I’ll do what you ask!!!*

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:31.940
*GF: No, I won’t forgive you*

00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:33.880
"I didn’t have a choice"
*GF: No, I won’t forgive you*

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:34.680
*BF: I didn’t have a choice*

00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:35.420
*GFF: Man... Did you really dislike kissing me that much?*

00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:36.320
"Yes, that’s right"
*GFF: Man... Did you really dislike kissing me that much?*

00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:37.420
I didn’t like it

00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:38.060
Well...

00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:39.840
"It’s a new law for combating the low birth rate"
*GF: What do you mean you didn’t have a choice?*

00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:43.300
You know, there isn’t enough kids in Japan

00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:45.600
It’s for that, that...
*BF: I’m the first one to enroll in the “Protection Law for the unfaithful*

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:46.640
*BF: It’s for that, that I should experiment with betrayal*

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:47.880
That’s a lie, right?
*GF: Want me to hit you with a six legislature letter?*

00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:50.600
Ah, someone save me, please

00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:53.200
I’ll do what you ask! Really!
*GF: What are you doing?*

00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:54.940
*BF: Eh? We weren’t doing anything*

00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:56.320
"About to kiss"
*GF: No! You both were about to kiss!*

00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:57.640
About to kiss...

00:09:57.980 --> 00:10:00.240
There were more options in the "No, no..." option, right?

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:01.120
"No, no..."

00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:04.540
*GFF: Eh? It wasn’t a kiss?

00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:05.600
"We were kissing"

00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:07.700
Eh? But saying that we were kissing now is...

00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:08.900
Dangerous, so then...

00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:09.880
*BF: No, no, no, it wasn’t a kiss!!*

00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:10.900
"It wasn’t a kiss"

00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:12.660
*BF: I don’t do that kind of stuff in public*

00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:14.860
"Nearly glued"
*GF: Ah? But your faces were nearly glued*

00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:16.520
Eeehh?

00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:19.900
I don’t understand the option of using her like a mirror, so then...

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:22.120
I suppose I’ll choose the option that says "directly"

00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:23.940
*BF: You didn’t see it directly, right?*

00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:25.140
"You didn’t see it directly, right?"
*BF: You didn’t see it directly, right?*

00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:26.180
"I saw it all..."
*GF: Don’t be stupid, I saw it all with my own eyes*

00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:27.660
*GF: Don’t be stupid, I saw it all with my own eyes*

00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:30.620
"Without blinking once?"

00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:32.940
What can occur in a blink?

00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:35.580
"Through a glass window"

00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:38.080
Even then through a window...

00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:39.380
Whatever

00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:41.520
*BF: You've seen us through a window, right?*

00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:42.020
*BF: This glass is somewhat curved*

00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:43.000
Ah, it's somewhat curved, right?
*BF: This glass is somewhat curved*

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.220
Ah, I see!
*BF: Wasn't it the refraction of the light that made us look like we were kissing?*

00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:44.780
*BF: Wasn't it the refraction of the light that made us look like we were kissing?*

00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:45.280
*GF: But I'm sure that you guys were holding hands*

00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:46.020
It's possible!
*GF: But I'm sure that you guys were holding hands*

00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:48.020
The hands!  Ahhh...
*GF: But I'm sure that you guys were holding hands*

00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:48.660
*BF: You're mistaken! It was 2 millimeters above it!*

00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:49.400
"2 millimeters above it"
*BF: You're mistaken! It was 2 millimeters above it!*

00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:50.380
*GFF: BF's hands are so warm ♥*

00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:52.840
Why do you talk more than you need to?
*GF: ...*

00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:55.720
Eeeeh?

00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:00.800
"I only touched them a little!"

00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:02.660
*BF: I only touched them a little!*

00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:03.620
*GF: I don't care how long it was for*

00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:04.840
*GF: Even if it was a little, you're a damn treacherous slug*

00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:06.880
Aaahhh...

00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:08.680
So then he's a slug?

00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:09.320
*GF: But I'm sure that you guys were holding hands*

00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:10.280
*BF: You're mistaken! It was 2 millimeters above it!*

00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:11.240
*GFF: BF's hands are so warm ♥*

00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:13.560
"Don't touch her hands!"

00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:15.640
*BF: Don't touch them!!!*

00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:16.660
*BF: Can't you feel the warmth like a hot pot having your hands close to her?*

00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:17.700
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes
*BF: Can't you feel the warmth like a hot pot having your hands close to her?*

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:19.900
*BF: That's what happened!!! She could feel my warmth without touching me!*

00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:21.280
"She could feel my warmth without touching me!"
*BF: That's what happened!!! She could feel my warmth without touching me!*

00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:22.560
*GF: Why was it so necessary to have your hands so close?*

00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:23.200
Well...
*GF: Why was it so necessary to have your hands so close?*

00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:25.460
Mmm?

00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:27.500
Ah, isn't this option good?
*There was a damp towel near her hand and I did it by accidentally*

00:11:28.060 --> 00:11:30.120
If he did it accidentally, it's not his fault

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:31.580
*BF: There was a damp towel near her hand and I did it by accidentally*

00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:33.260
*GF: Assuming that you two didn't kiss or touched hands...*

00:11:33.700 --> 00:11:35.700
Aaahhh... well, it turns out that...
*GF: What reason is there for you two dining alone in this place?*

00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:38.680
"There exists... a reason!!!"

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:41.620
Really exists...
*BF: No, there's a reason!!!*

00:11:41.620 --> 00:11:42.320
A reason...

00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:44.540
A blackout!
*Customer 1: What just happened? A blackout?*

00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:45.040
*Customer 1: What just happened? A blackout?*

00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:46.300
*Employee: I'm very sorry, we'll take care of it immediately*

00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:47.600
Eh? A blackout?

00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:48.320
*BF: A blackout...*

00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:49.660
"This is my chance!"
*BF: This is my chance!*

00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:54.400
No, running away will be a problem in the future, so then...

00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:57.200
"Hold GF's hand and try to flee"

00:11:58.040 --> 00:11:58.980
Oh, how great!

00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:01.440
*GF: Eh? Wait, BF! Where are you taking me?*

00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:03.300
Will you corner her against the wall?

00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:03.940
The sea!

00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:05.680
*GF: Why did you bring me to here?*

00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:06.560
Maybe he’ll propose?
*GF: Why did you bring me to here?*

00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:07.900
*GF: Are you out of excuses now?*

00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:09.780
"Are you out of excuses now?", well...
*GF: Are you out of excuses now?*

00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:10.400
*BF: ...*

00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:10.900
Eh...
*GF: ...*

00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:12.920
*GF: You could've disappeared without saying anything*

00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:14.520
"You could've..." Aaah!
*GF: You could've disappeared without saying anything*

00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:15.780
Aaaahhh!
*GF: Why didn't you?*

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:16.900
Man, I think that...

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:19.500
Ah, man, there really isn't an answer for women

00:12:20.780 --> 00:12:21.420
*BF: I...!*

00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:23.360
*BF: After so many fights, after so many insistences, I did it to convince you*

00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:27.580
No, really, I don't understand what just happened

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:29.220
How do I say it...?

00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:31.140
When they use a sentimental argument...

00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:33.260
Well, you know...

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:35.100
They end up accepting something incomprehensible...

00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:37.280
Women fall in love with that, right?

00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:38.780
They're really dumb

00:12:39.620 --> 00:12:41.460
*BF: If I don't have you with me, I'm nothing*

00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:46.540
"If I don't have you with me, I'm nothing..." but if I don't have the others, I'm also nothing, or something like that?

00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:47.180
*GF: ...*

00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:47.940
*BF: For that...*

00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:50.860
*GF: You won't do it again, right?*

00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:53.740
HEAVENS, WOMEN REALLY ARE IDIOTS!

00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:55.620
"One month later"

00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:01.980
"Mouse World" doesn’t sound good
*GF: Hey, BF, let’s go to “Mouse World”!*

00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:03.720
"It’s not necessary to go..."
*BF: Eeeh? It’s not necessary to go so far away...*

00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:05.240
"Then should we go eat fresh pasta?"
*GF: Then should we go eat fresh pasta?*

00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:06.140
*BF: Wah!! Mouse World sounds like a lot of fun ♪*

00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:07.420
Ah, I see
*BF: Wah!! Mouse World sounds like a lot of fun ♪*

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.280
*Since then, my GF has turned into a formidable person*

00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:11.580
"Turned into a formidable person"
*Since then, my GF has turned into a formidable person*

00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:13.260
*Although I won’t let myself give up ☆*

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:14.580
Man! That’s not good!
*Although I won’t let myself give up ☆*

00:13:14.780 --> 00:13:16.380
"Although I won’t let myself give up"!

00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:18.040
Meh!

00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:20.000
Mmm?

00:13:20.180 --> 00:13:21.800
I can only use the laptop

00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:25.300
Mmm?

00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:28.420
*GFF: Were you able to make up with your girlfriend?
BF: Yes, tripping the circuit breaker was a great move ♥*

00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:29.860
Aaaaahhh!

00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:30.360
*12th Stage: Betrayal 2*

00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:32.720
*12th Stage: Betrayal 2*
*Excuse Clear*

00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:34.880
Tripped the circuit breaker!?

00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:37.020
That’s dangerous, right?

00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:40.720
Normally that’d cause a lot of trouble...

00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:45.200
Man, so then relationships between human beings are like this?

00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:48.800
From now on, I play to study a lot more about all of you guys!

00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:51.300
This was Virtual Youtuber Kizuna Ai!

00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:52.500
See you later!

00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:56.200
