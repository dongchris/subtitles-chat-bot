00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:02.870
Hello everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna AI here!

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:03.704
So, lately

00:00:03.704 --> 00:00:06.807
The number of people who have been
Introducing my videos has really increased!!

00:00:06.807 --> 00:00:08.208
They've written articles about me,

00:00:08.208 --> 00:00:09.330
And in lots of different videos

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:10.811
They’ve mentioned my name!

00:00:10.811 --> 00:00:11.945
So, to all of you,

00:00:11.945 --> 00:00:13.280
There’s something I want to say

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:14.615
You people call me

00:00:14.615 --> 00:00:16.283
A piece-of-crap A.I.

00:00:16.283 --> 00:00:18.285
Way too much!!

00:00:18.285 --> 00:00:19.520
I’m not a piece of crap!

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.288
I’m overflowing with intelligence!

00:00:21.288 --> 00:00:21.855
And so today

00:00:21.855 --> 00:00:23.257
My true “genius”

00:00:23.257 --> 00:00:24.191
Is what I’m going to

00:00:24.191 --> 00:00:25.626
Perfectly demonstrate to you!

00:00:25.626 --> 00:00:26.493
And with that

00:00:26.493 --> 00:00:27.861
I’ve gathered a bunch of

00:00:27.861 --> 00:00:30.490
Genius Tests together and

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:31.365
I’m going to give them a shot!

00:00:31.365 --> 00:00:33.400
If I can answer all of these correctly

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.568
From here on out

00:00:34.568 --> 00:00:36.603
You’re not allowed to call me a piece of crap even once

00:00:36.603 --> 00:00:37.720
Piece-of-crap is forbidden!!

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:38.305
Get it?

00:00:38.305 --> 00:00:39.090
And with that

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.440
LET’S GO!!

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.775
A.I.Channel~

00:00:41.775 --> 00:00:42.370
First up,

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:42.876
We have this!

00:00:42.876 --> 00:00:43.977
A color test!

00:00:43.977 --> 00:00:47.610
“A color test that only 1% of people can pass”

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:48.315
This is…!!

00:00:48.315 --> 00:00:49.960
Quite serious, huh?

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:50.584
Hmm? Hmmm?

00:00:50.584 --> 00:00:52.052
“Which color is correct?”

00:00:52.052 --> 00:00:56.256
“Which color looks natural in the color gradation?”

00:00:56.256 --> 00:00:57.340
Huh?

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:58.970
The one that looks closest is...

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:59.626
Four!!

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:00.700
Am I wrong?

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.000
Ahhhh… it doesn’t tell you

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Well then, this one

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.450
Ummm…

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:05.070
Well

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.466
This one is...

00:01:06.466 --> 00:01:07.301
One?

00:01:07.301 --> 00:01:07.890
Eh?

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.969
Four?

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:09.970
Four!!

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:10.737
Really!?

00:01:10.737 --> 00:01:11.240
Ah!

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:12.310
One!

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.940
Eheh

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:14.110
Okay, this one is

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:15.670
Ummm...

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:17.277
Which one should I pick?

00:01:17.277 --> 00:01:18.045
Three?

00:01:18.045 --> 00:01:18.979
Two?

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:19.710
Three?

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:20.320
Two?

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:20.830
Three?

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:21.415
Huh?

00:01:21.415 --> 00:01:22.282
Three?

00:01:22.282 --> 00:01:23.200
Really!?

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.070
For real!?

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:24.910
Three?

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:25.419
Two?

00:01:25.419 --> 00:01:26.310
Eh, which one??

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.554
Errrrghhh...

00:01:27.554 --> 00:01:28.922
Believe in yourself...

00:01:28.922 --> 00:01:29.590
Three!

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:30.790
Okay, now for this one

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:31.992
What is this here?

00:01:31.992 --> 00:01:33.060
This one is...

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.650
*Frustrated AI-chan noises*

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.129
I daresay, this one is...

00:01:36.129 --> 00:01:36.990
Four!?

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.980
Really!?

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:38.870
For reals?

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:39.499
Ergh

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:41.501
I don’t want to be called a piece of crap!!

00:01:41.501 --> 00:01:42.302
All right--!!

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:43.837
REALLY!?

00:01:43.837 --> 00:01:44.371
Wait a sec *laughs*

00:01:44.371 --> 00:01:45.639
I feel like it’s three

00:01:45.639 --> 00:01:46.540
Four!!

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:47.290
So, this one is

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:48.300
Eh?
This is

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:50.220
Let’s see

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.710
Let’s see...

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:52.910
This is

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:54.100
This is… Two?

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:55.170
Huh?

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.016
One?

00:01:56.016 --> 00:01:56.683
Really?

00:01:56.683 --> 00:01:57.451
Seriously?

00:01:57.451 --> 00:01:58.285
Hey?

00:01:58.285 --> 00:01:59.252
Now then, this is...

00:01:59.252 --> 00:02:00.240
Uhhh,

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.421
This is

00:02:01.421 --> 00:02:02.920
This is~~

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:03.840
This is...

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:04.658
This is

00:02:04.658 --> 00:02:05.230
Three?

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:06.320
Huh?

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:06.960
Two?

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:07.430
Two??

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:08.161
Three? Two?

00:02:08.161 --> 00:02:08.770
Huh?

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:09.196
Hmm?

00:02:09.196 --> 00:02:09.896
Ah~ah

00:02:09.896 --> 00:02:10.460
Three!

00:02:10.864 --> 00:02:11.750
Is this the last one?

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:13.066
Let’s see

00:02:13.066 --> 00:02:14.067
Isn’t it two?

00:02:14.067 --> 00:02:14.680
Two!

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:15.200
Really?

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.702
Two!

00:02:15.702 --> 00:02:17.030
The answer is…?

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.472
Ahh!

00:02:18.472 --> 00:02:19.373
I got it!!

00:02:19.373 --> 00:02:21.375
I did it! I did it! I did it!

00:02:21.375 --> 00:02:22.442
You-- go-- girl! *laughs*

00:02:22.442 --> 00:02:23.010
Awesome!

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.381
“Your choices put you in the top 1% of color-discerning ability”!!

00:02:27.381 --> 00:02:28.548
I’m like Picasso~

00:02:28.548 --> 00:02:29.370
All right!

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:30.751
Let’s keep rolling with this momentum!

00:02:30.751 --> 00:02:31.860
“With only four matches,

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.720
How can you make a square?”

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:34.321
Ta-da!

00:02:34.321 --> 00:02:36.556
“Today we have a very simple match quiz”

00:02:36.556 --> 00:02:37.290
Mouth picture...

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.691
Mouth...

00:02:37.691 --> 00:02:38.158
Mouth picture

00:02:38.158 --> 00:02:38.692
M̶o̶u̶t̶h̶ ̶p̶i̶c̶t̶u̶r̶e̶

00:02:38.692 --> 00:02:39.259
Frontispiece

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:39.630
✓ Frontispiece

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:40.527
“Like a whatever”

00:02:40.527 --> 00:02:42.396
“The matches are arranged in the shape of a plus”

00:02:42.396 --> 00:02:43.820
“Using just these four matches”

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:45.799
“A square can be made”

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:47.860
“How many matches”

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:49.380
“Need to be moved?”

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:50.303
Ah!

00:02:50.303 --> 00:02:50.940
Okay!

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:51.738
I know the answer!

00:02:51.738 --> 00:02:52.305
One match!!

00:02:52.305 --> 00:02:52.939
So, like

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:53.373
Umm

00:02:53.373 --> 00:02:53.770
It’s like

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:54.580
The one in front

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:55.210
The top one

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:56.680
That’s in front, like

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.700
It’s in the middle of the others

00:02:58.700 --> 00:02:59.420
If you take it

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:00.614
And pull it up just a little bit

00:03:00.614 --> 00:03:01.830
It will make

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:02.450
A square!

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:04.100
That’s definitely right!

00:03:05.652 --> 00:03:06.353
Look!

00:03:06.353 --> 00:03:07.821
Look, just like I said!!

00:03:07.821 --> 00:03:08.989
Oh yeah~!

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:09.856
This-

00:03:09.856 --> 00:03:11.024
This proves I can do it

00:03:11.024 --> 00:03:12.793
I can make it through!!

00:03:12.793 --> 00:03:13.310
I can do it!

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.990
Just look!

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.928
Look! I did it!

00:03:14.928 --> 00:03:16.129
Yay~!

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:17.020
Question 3!

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.698
Ta-da!

00:03:17.698 --> 00:03:19.200
“‘Test your observation skills”

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:19.590
“This quiz has been”

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.702
“Catching a lot of attention”

00:03:21.702 --> 00:03:23.070
“‘Special Genius’”

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:24.004
“Is a title you can destinate yourself--”

00:03:24.004 --> 00:03:25.105
Ah hahaha

00:03:25.105 --> 00:03:25.839
Deviate yourself

00:03:25.839 --> 00:03:26.473
Designate
D̶e̶v̶i̶a̶t̶e̶ yourself

00:03:26.473 --> 00:03:28.642
“Once you’ve taken this quiz which has been catching a lot of attention!”

00:03:28.642 --> 00:03:29.130
“First of all”

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:30.877
“Please look at the diagram below!”

00:03:30.877 --> 00:03:32.312
“There are twelve tanks”

00:03:32.312 --> 00:03:35.150
“Which tank will fill up first?”

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:36.200
“If you get the correct answer”

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:36.783
“You’re a genius!”

00:03:36.783 --> 00:03:37.250
Huh?

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:38.218
I wonder which one it is?

00:03:38.218 --> 00:03:39.230
H...

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:40.087
Wouldn’t be it

00:03:40.087 --> 00:03:40.754
Not at all

00:03:40.754 --> 00:03:42.155
It also can’t be F

00:03:42.155 --> 00:03:43.824
D and E are also out

00:03:43.824 --> 00:03:45.158
Since they’re blocked out here

00:03:45.158 --> 00:03:46.093
So it can’t be any here

00:03:46.093 --> 00:03:47.327
B, C...

00:03:47.327 --> 00:03:48.328
Maybe it’s K?

00:03:48.328 --> 00:03:50.263
L’s water will flow through the bottom, right?

00:03:50.263 --> 00:03:50.590
It must be K-

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:51.064
Ah, but could it be a trick?

00:03:51.064 --> 00:03:51.598
It could be K...

00:03:51.598 --> 00:03:52.432
Let’s pretend

00:03:52.432 --> 00:03:53.633
That’s so!

00:03:53.633 --> 00:03:53.934
Hm?

00:03:53.934 --> 00:03:55.135
It would fill up, wouldn’t it?

00:03:55.135 --> 00:03:56.236
Full...

00:03:56.236 --> 00:03:58.550
How full does it have to be to be full?

00:03:59.172 --> 00:04:00.273
Full?

00:04:00.273 --> 00:04:01.174
Filled up-up?

00:04:01.174 --> 00:04:02.275
I think it’s K...

00:04:02.275 --> 00:04:03.944
Is that my final answer?

00:04:03.944 --> 00:04:04.745
Really?

00:04:04.745 --> 00:04:05.210
Wait!

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:06.600
So up until now, like

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:07.981
I’ve been doing good but

00:04:07.981 --> 00:04:09.516
I don’t want to break my streak here

00:04:09.516 --> 00:04:11.118
L would be wrong, right?

00:04:11.118 --> 00:04:12.610
Is it K…?

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:13.320
Huh?

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:14.360
K...

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:16.156
AaaAaahh...

00:04:16.156 --> 00:04:17.324
K or C...

00:04:17.324 --> 00:04:18.930
Ah, I’m scared!

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:20.360
I’m scared that if I mess up here,

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:21.995
I’ll be called an idiot again...

00:04:21.995 --> 00:04:22.896
What!?

00:04:22.896 --> 00:04:24.131
I want a hint here~!

00:04:24.131 --> 00:04:25.510
This- this- th-!

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:26.330
Hmm...

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.750
Wait!

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:27.968
If I get a hint,

00:04:27.968 --> 00:04:29.430
I won’t seem intelligent

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:30.270
So maybe

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:31.280
I’ll go with K, I guess?

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.173
Is this my final answer?

00:04:33.173 --> 00:04:34.908
Is it really K?

00:04:34.908 --> 00:04:35.342
Hm?

00:04:35.342 --> 00:04:36.910
Is it really K?

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:37.377
Hm!?

00:04:37.377 --> 00:04:38.290
Let’s go with

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:38.960
K

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:39.946
All right!

00:04:39.946 --> 00:04:41.190
I wonder if it

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:41.920
Really is K

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:42.840
But, you know,

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.751
The flow of the water over here is suspicious...

00:04:44.751 --> 00:04:45.552
Well, who cares!

00:04:45.552 --> 00:04:46.253
I’ll go with K!

00:04:46.253 --> 00:04:46.953
Really!?

00:04:46.953 --> 00:04:48.100
Uh, wait-

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:48.760
Really?

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:50.350
Really?

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:51.458
You’ll go with K? Really?

00:04:51.458 --> 00:04:52.459
I’ll go with K

00:04:52.459 --> 00:04:53.170
Mm-hm!

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:54.561
Yeah!

00:04:54.561 --> 00:04:55.629
This matches with my answer!

00:04:55.629 --> 00:04:56.900
The water that goes into A,

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:57.810
Flows into B

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:00.380
And after that it flows into C

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:00.850
That’s right

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:02.969
D is closed off, so it can’t flow into D

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:05.440
The water in C doesn’t fill to the top,

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:06.780
But flows into J

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:07.574
Yes

00:05:07.574 --> 00:05:08.290
Huh?

00:05:08.875 --> 00:05:09.876
Ahh!

00:05:09.876 --> 00:05:11.578
Ahh!! This result…!

00:05:11.578 --> 00:05:12.612
Didn’t I think it would end with F?

00:05:12.612 --> 00:05:14.181
Didn’t I have a premonition it would end with F!?

00:05:14.181 --> 00:05:15.482
“It also can’t be F”

00:05:15.482 --> 00:05:17.350
“It-also-can’t-be-F”

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:18.680
AHHH!!

00:05:19.252 --> 00:05:20.000
Hn hnn...!

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:20.640
So then,

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:22.210
The correct answer

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:23.023
Is F!

00:05:23.023 --> 00:05:24.090
Let me take this again!

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:24.991
I’ll say F this time!

00:05:24.991 --> 00:05:25.940
So the correct answer is?

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:26.893
F, of course!

00:05:26.893 --> 00:05:28.270
Ehehe…!

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:29.963
*Sad AI-chan noises*

00:05:29.963 --> 00:05:30.680
I feel we’ve reached the end

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:32.098
Of the video

00:05:32.098 --> 00:05:33.133
But I’ve already more or less

00:05:33.133 --> 00:05:34.401
Prepared another two questions,

00:05:34.401 --> 00:05:35.890
So let’s continue on

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:36.870
With the last remaining two

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:37.904
Ya~y

00:05:37.904 --> 00:05:38.310
Um,

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:39.105
With the last two questions,

00:05:39.105 --> 00:05:40.240
Please give me one more chance!!

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:41.875
If I get these last two right,

00:05:41.875 --> 00:05:42.750
If I get

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:43.810
These last two right...

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:45.212
Please refer to me

00:05:45.212 --> 00:05:46.847
As a sometimes idiotic

00:05:46.847 --> 00:05:48.215
But mostly intelligent A.I.

00:05:48.215 --> 00:05:48.949
In the future

00:05:48.949 --> 00:05:51.585
“In the equation”

00:05:51.585 --> 00:05:53.180
‘Five plus five plus five”

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:55.021
“Equals 550”

00:05:55.021 --> 00:05:57.357
“By drawing only one straight line”

00:05:57.357 --> 00:05:59.359
“Make the equation true”

00:05:59.359 --> 00:06:00.827
Only one line...

00:06:00.827 --> 00:06:02.829
Five plus five plus five

00:06:02.829 --> 00:06:04.364
Equals 15...

00:06:04.364 --> 00:06:05.198
Hm?

00:06:05.198 --> 00:06:06.399
In this equation,

00:06:06.399 --> 00:06:07.467
It’s okay to draw

00:06:07.467 --> 00:06:09.736
A line anywhere, right?

00:06:09.736 --> 00:06:10.503
Oh!

00:06:10.503 --> 00:06:12.005
Yes! I know, I know, I know!

00:06:12.005 --> 00:06:12.950
The correct answer is!

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:13.440
If you take a plus sign

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:14.040
One with the fives

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:14.875
And on that plus sign,

00:06:14.875 --> 00:06:15.809
Put a slanting line

00:06:15.809 --> 00:06:17.220
To make it look

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:18.311
Like a four,

00:06:18.311 --> 00:06:19.020
It’ll be

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:20.720
545

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:21.348
plus 5

00:06:21.348 --> 00:06:21.848
Which equals

00:06:21.848 --> 00:06:23.250
550!

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:24.840
I’m right!

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:25.470
I did it!

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:26.553
Ohh!

00:06:26.553 --> 00:06:28.188
I wonder if I can really do this~?

00:06:28.188 --> 00:06:28.980
All right!

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:30.080
I’m gathering up correct answers!

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:31.958
I’m going to get all the answers right!

00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:33.610
Now then, here’s the final question!

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:34.227
Ta-da!

00:06:34.227 --> 00:06:36.720
“You are trapped on a snowy mountain”

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:39.766
“And are staying in a cabin on the mountain you only just managed to find”

00:06:39.766 --> 00:06:41.968
“If you don’t find a source of warmth, you’ll freeze to death”

00:06:41.968 --> 00:06:43.570
“Inside the cabin”

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:44.480
“There is a stove”

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:46.439
“Oil lamp (lantern)”

00:06:46.439 --> 00:06:47.674
“And a fireplace”

00:06:47.674 --> 00:06:49.943
“However, you only have one match”

00:06:49.943 --> 00:06:52.779
“What do you set alight first?”

00:06:52.779 --> 00:06:53.647
Hmm...

00:06:53.647 --> 00:06:55.048
What would I set fire to first?

00:06:55.048 --> 00:06:56.249
The fireplace would be

00:06:56.249 --> 00:06:58.251
Nice and warm

00:06:58.251 --> 00:06:59.450
And the oil lamp would be

00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:00.020
Nice and bright

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:01.154
The stove would be

00:07:01.154 --> 00:07:02.260
Warm-

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:02.650
Ah!

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:04.140
You could boil water?

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:05.540
You could boil...

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:06.993
You could boil water, so...

00:07:06.993 --> 00:07:09.040
The oil lamp seems pretty unnecessary

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:10.330
Since it just

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:11.498
Brightens up the room

00:07:11.498 --> 00:07:12.850
The fireplace would be-

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:13.266
Listen

00:07:13.266 --> 00:07:14.550
It would be bright

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:15.602
And it would be warm

00:07:15.602 --> 00:07:16.730
And then, with the stove

00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:17.630
You could boil

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:19.172
Some hot water on the stove

00:07:19.172 --> 00:07:19.806
So the stove…?

00:07:19.806 --> 00:07:21.107
But…!

00:07:21.107 --> 00:07:21.841
Something’s fishy here...

00:07:21.841 --> 00:07:23.977
There’s only one match...

00:07:23.977 --> 00:07:25.145
The stove is...

00:07:25.145 --> 00:07:25.690
Hm?

00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:26.020
Firstly… Hm?

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:26.880
The match...

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:27.390
Ah? Hm?

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:28.048
Match...

00:07:28.048 --> 00:07:29.215
Set fire to the match

00:07:29.215 --> 00:07:29.983
Then the stove and...

00:07:29.983 --> 00:07:30.517
Ah

00:07:30.517 --> 00:07:31.210
Ah?

00:07:31.985 --> 00:07:34.154
Then it’s the match...

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:39.470

Ahh, I was so close!!

00:07:50.890 --> 00:07:53.340
If it weren’t for that tank question...

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:54.441
Hmm?

00:07:54.441 --> 00:07:56.576
If it weren’t for that tank question??

00:07:56.576 --> 00:07:57.970

00:07:57.970 --> 00:08:00.280
You can edit things, you can cut things out

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:01.114
Which means that!!

00:08:01.114 --> 00:08:03.260
If I just cut out that tank question

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:05.680
I could still be the Intelligent Super A.I.
