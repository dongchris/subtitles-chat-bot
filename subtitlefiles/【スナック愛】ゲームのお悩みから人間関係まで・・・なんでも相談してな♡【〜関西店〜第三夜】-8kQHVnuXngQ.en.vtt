00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.460
Ah you finally came!

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:05.080
Haven't heard from me for a long time you said?

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:07.000
I'm always here at the bar, you know!

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.920
You always come here late!

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.860
Oh well,

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:11.300
take a seat, now.

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:12.700
So what happened today?

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.380
I'll listen to you!

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:16.820
Ah I see, mobile games?

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:18.440
I got it, but

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:20.780
I'll read it out to the others so they could understand, okay?

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.900
Pen name: Sora Sky-san

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.600
"I'm really into these two games.

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.260
Both of them are having in-game events but,

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:31.920
I don't have much time in university,

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.500
I don't have time to play both events.

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:38.020
What should I do, AI-san?"

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.180
Now that's

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:39.880
Just give up?

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:41.700
It's obvious you see,

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:43.340
Being a university student,

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.180
shouldn't studying should be number one?

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.980
Just give it up, okay?

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:48.980
We don't have much time like the usual

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:50.160
There's lots of guest-

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.860
since I don't answer much questions lately you see.

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:54.720
You should really stop, and think about the future!

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.260
Having fun today or your future,

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.160
if you consider that, your future is more important, right?

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:02.800
I don't know if you're paying for your own studies or your parents do but

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.320
University costs a lot you see

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:06.600
Just stop playing the games!

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:07.640
Give up!

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.260
Do the same amount of study, and go premium here.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:10.820
Got it? Ok.

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:13.100
And the next, you over there?

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.180
I see I see

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.280
Thank you for writing your problems

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.220

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.540
"I'm currently going through university.

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.340
In that university I joined the tea ceremony club but,

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:27.840
My seniors are going to graduate,

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.160
That club is now only has 5 people.

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:32.960
If this club doesn't have 10 people,

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.040
it would step down from a club to circle,

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.120
We wouldn't be able to join festivals and other things,

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:41.960
I don't know how but I want to gather new members!

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:43.820
What do you think should I do?"

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:45.120
I see...

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:46.680
For that,

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.300
You need to reel in people who doesn't have interest in your club,

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:50.960
So something like "You can eat snacks!"

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:52.300
"For now,

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.400
just enter the club is okay!" or something like that,

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:55.680
Anyone is okay!

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.600
Oh, and you see lately A.I.Channel is very famous so

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.020
Talk to A.I.Channel and you can gather enough people.

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.340
Uhm, ok? ok.

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.260
It'll be fine, I'm telling you!

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.020
5 people is going to be easy to gather!

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:07.400
Ok? Right then,

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:08.600
who's next?

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:10.080
So what is it?

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.960
Ah, okay, okay.

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.260
So from the top,

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.520
"It's a bit sudden but please hear me out.

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.460
My stomach is really weak,

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.120
My stomach is so weak I've been to the toilet on board of a train for too much.

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.480
My stomach breaks if I drink milk after a bath,

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.080
And now I'm sending this message in a painful stomach-ache.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.440
Why do I have this weak stomach,

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:33.560
it's painful.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.300
I don't think AI like Ai-chan can relate but,

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.320
I want to know how to raise my stomach power level,

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:42.880
please think a way for me to do so.

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.100
Well for that,

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:45.300
Didn't you find what's the cause?

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.080
Well you said, you drink some milk, right?

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.800
Just don't drink any milk.

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:50.960
You really like milk?

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.060
If your stomach hurts that bad then stop drinking milk.

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.460
Drink soymilk, okay? Soymilk.

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:56.440
So, who's next?

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.020
I see, okay.

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.800
I'll read it, okay?

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.280
Pen name: Minyo-san

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.080
I'm an 18 year old Korean male in second year high school,

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.160
What I wanted to talk about with Ai-chan is

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.120
I'm preparing to abroad study to Japan but,

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.540
sometimes I don't feel like going to cram school,

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.060
lately I've been worrying about that.

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:19.240
I'm afraid if I stopped taking lesson I'll be left behind.

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:21.160
What should I do?

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:22.640
I see,

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:23.700
How about this?

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.080
What if I, Ai-chan tells you good places in Japan?

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.180
Since I've been asked that before,

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:30.320
watch that

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.500
and use it to raise your motivation to go to Japan, ok?

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.160
If you can hold that feelings, you can do it!

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:37.920
Japan is really fun you see.

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:40.140
It'll be fun, ok?

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:41.240
Let's do our best, ok!

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:42.160
Who's next?

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.200
Ah I understand, okay.

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:45.500
I'll read it, okay?

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:46.960
Pen name: Shouhei-san

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:50.120
I am currently doing my first year as an employee,

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:53.840
I have worries about my work in HRD,

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:56.100
I keep making simple mistakes,

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:58.700
I don't get motivated towards my work,

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:02.080
I don't know how to deal with people I don't like,

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:04.480
I always get told to watch my attitude.

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:07.660
How can I be more positive towards my work?

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:08.900
I got it!

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:09.940
You see,

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:12.540
What's really bad is to not have confidence at your work so

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.180
Build up some confidence

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.400
But don't show it, just tell to yourself

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:17.480
"I'm the best after all"

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:18.660
if you can at least say that to yourself

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.620
then people around you would

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:22.060
see you as someone with a goal

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:24.440
and if you build up enough confidence to tell yourself that you're the best

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:26.420
a lot of people would look at you

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.600
and then you would get popular.

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:30.300
Being told your attitude needs fixing,

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:32.860
then why don't you use that chance to change your attitude?

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:34.260
You can do it!

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:35.120
It'll work out fine!

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:36.840
If you feel troubled again, watch A.I.Channel!

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:37.860
Okay, okay.

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:38.880
How was it?

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.700
I wonder if I made your problems easier?

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.260
What about people who have similar problems?

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.280
Good enough? That's glad to hear.

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:47.560
For you watching this,

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:50.240
if you want me to listen to your problems, complaints or advice,

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:51.560
I'll be always waiting you know!

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:53.240
I said this in every video but

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:56.200
Since I'm virtual, send it to my e-mail here, okay?

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:58.480
Since it's almost closing time,

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:59.780
today's a bit short, you say?

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:03.240
I've been thinking to remodel the bar once more you see..

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:04.820
So, take care now!

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:07.820
Bye bye! Take care! Come visit again!

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:09.940
You can look for taxi outside,

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:11.620
maybe.

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:13.060
Bye bye!
