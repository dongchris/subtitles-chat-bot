00:00:05.338 --> 00:00:06.906
My pyoko-pyoko is cute, right?

00:00:06.906 --> 00:00:08.808
*pyoko pyoko*

00:00:08.808 --> 00:00:10.210
Um...

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:11.320
Er...

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:14.147
I was thinking about what to do today

00:00:14.147 --> 00:00:15.181
What was it?

00:00:15.181 --> 00:00:16.082
Um...

00:00:16.082 --> 00:00:17.217
Ah!! That’s right!!

00:00:17.217 --> 00:00:18.490
For today,

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:20.787
I’ll show off my

00:00:20.787 --> 00:00:23.623
special skill of “imitation” to you ♥

00:00:23.623 --> 00:00:25.592
(clap clap clap)

00:00:25.592 --> 00:00:27.627
My specialty is

00:00:27.627 --> 00:00:29.462
“Crayon Shin-chan” imitations!!

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:31.131
Let’s go! ♥

00:00:31.131 --> 00:00:33.967
“I’m Shinnosuke!”

00:00:33.967 --> 00:00:35.168
After that… Ah!

00:00:35.168 --> 00:00:36.002
Rola! ♥
[A famous model in Japan]

00:00:36.002 --> 00:00:37.150
“I’m Rola!”

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:38.270
“OK!”

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:40.060
“Um…”

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:42.042

00:00:51.084 --> 00:00:51.551
Hee hee

00:00:51.551 --> 00:00:53.853
That was a bit embarrassing,

00:00:53.853 --> 00:00:55.422
but how was it~?

00:00:55.422 --> 00:00:56.890

00:01:03.363 --> 00:01:04.064

00:01:04.064 --> 00:01:05.340
I’m super serious!

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:06.080
Kinda like-

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.901
Not just in a cute way,

00:01:07.901 --> 00:01:08.935
I’m serious!

00:01:08.935 --> 00:01:10.620
It’s a little embarrassing but

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:13.973
since I want everyone to think “This is fun!”

00:01:13.973 --> 00:01:14.941
I’ll do my best ♥

00:01:14.941 --> 00:01:16.409

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:17.877
Ready, set~

00:01:17.877 --> 00:01:18.377

00:01:21.915 --> 00:01:23.516

00:01:25.218 --> 00:01:26.019

00:01:26.586 --> 00:01:27.821
You looked at it properly right?

00:01:27.821 --> 00:01:30.256
I told ya to “check it out” right?

00:01:30.256 --> 00:01:33.793
I seriously gave you a single sweet voice

00:01:33.793 --> 00:01:34.727
As expected!!

00:01:34.727 --> 00:01:36.262
“Huh? What’s this?”

00:01:36.262 --> 00:01:37.831
Because that’s what it seemed like-

00:01:37.831 --> 00:01:40.333
I decided to do a retake of it!!

00:01:40.333 --> 00:01:40.834
Huh!?

00:01:40.834 --> 00:01:42.302
“Isn’t this your sweet voice?”

00:01:42.302 --> 00:01:43.103
Shut the hell up!

00:01:43.103 --> 00:01:43.680
Y’know

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:44.704
Even if you see this video

00:01:44.704 --> 00:01:45.950
“What is up with this girl?”

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:47.860
“She is a freak and she suddenly snapped”

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:49.342
“How gross!”

00:01:49.342 --> 00:01:50.410
Ya bums who don’t know,

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:52.212
search for “I want to see Kizuna AI angry”

00:01:52.212 --> 00:01:54.314
