00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.500
I, Kizuna Ai...

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.300
Am going to do some reflection!

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.900
I want to connect with all you humans!

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:11.200
So I’ll keep putting out interesting videos!

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:14.320
That’s what I came to YouTube for...

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:18.580
But my view count just isn’t increasing!

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:20.580
And with that in mind, today...!

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.500
I’m going to save...

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.130
These cute, cute videos that I made with love!

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.580
I’m a bit worried about the view count...

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:30.980
On the videos from December to February...

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:36.120
I want to show you some good picks from my little babies!

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.020
Thank you so much everyone!

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:39.880
Well then, let’s give it a try!

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:41.300
We’ll start with this video...

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:42.400
Te, ren!

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.220
“[Even from home] Visit a shrine online! [From anywhere]”

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:47.940
Well… is this alright?

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.160
With the rooster act right at the beginning...

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.980
I feel like it should get people hooked right away

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:58.920
The best bit is right at the start, isn’t it?

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.280
The rooster… captures people’s hearts

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.100
Following this is…

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:03.560
Clapping!

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:05.720
I...

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.860
Struggle with clapping a lot...

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.120
I tried really hard... right?

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.040
I followed the proper traditions...

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.380
Two bows, two claps...

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.700
One bow... I'm actually doing it!

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.140
Like... the parts I'm teaching the proper manners...

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.720
I’d like you to see them

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.100
And also, this is the first video...

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.360
That I released in 2017!

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.380
You know... maybe everybody was busy with New Year's, so they couldn't watch it...

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.760
Right?

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:39.400
Right?

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.560
It's summer vacation...

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.860
The period which you have a lot of free time, right?

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:46.920
You can watch it~

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.500
Next up is... this!

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:49.160
"TOREBA"!

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.280
“Trying the Remote Control Crane Game "TOREBA"!”

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.300
Wow, this is nostalgic, isn't it?

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.740
This was my first time... that's the reason to watch!

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:58.920
The first time...

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:00.660
That I, Kizuna Ai, have...

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.720
Played a crane game!

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.080
Well, the results were...

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:07.360
Like that!
*Please go watch the video*

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.760
But isn't me trying my hardest...

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:13.460
A little bit cute?

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.160
Doesn't it make you want to cheer me on?

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:17.440
Right?

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.400
It does, right? Yeah, so...

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:21.680
Let’s see...

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.760
That time, I was only playing with the three free chances I had...

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.980
Next time...

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:29.600
I'll try until...

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.620
I can get one...

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.800
For preparation!

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.840
Prepare? Review? Oh, it's review...

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.400
To review, everyone, please check it out!

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:41.700
Next up is this video!

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.840
"Positive Monster, Kizuna Ai"

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.380
So, I see...

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.720
This project... isn't really popular...

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.560
But still! It must be that...

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:54.400
Everyone is too positive!

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.920
So positive that you don't need to watch it!

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.880
It's a great thing that everybody is optimistic!

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.580
It’s a good thing, right? Everyone being positive, right?

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:04.000
But, well...

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.000
It's summer now...

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.200
For the people who deep down have hearts that were broken by relationships...

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:09.740
For that naive person, you there…

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.800
Watch this video, and let's be positive!

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.800
Let’s get rid of that... sadness in your heart!

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.180
And so the next video is… this!

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.000
“Welcome to Ai's rehabilitation factory!”

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:22.400
Man...

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.200
I AM SO SORRY!

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.920
Since I was so worried about the comedy material in this… I plagiarized all of it!

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.720
I'll be honest, I really did just steal all of it...

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.300
Didn’t think up aaaaany of it!

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:38.080
Well, you know! Summer is very hot, isn’t it?

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.920
Aren’t you using your air conditioning? Isn’t the electric utility bill...

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.380
Shooting up in cost? Aren’t you having problems?!

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.980
Well, I think we have landed at the perfect timing in this video, haven’t we?

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.280
Just by hearing these frigid jokes... 
*Note: A "frigid" joke is a lame one*

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.380
One can cool themselves off without even needing air conditioning!

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:55.520
Economically saving on your electric bill! It’s even light on your wallet!

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:56.580
If you watch it...

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:58.140
Watch it this summer

00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.800
Well, it's decided, it’s perfect

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:01.900
And next up, this one!

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.560
“I tried making a commercial, OH! A.I.Channel”

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:06.600
Man...

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:08.000
This...

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.840
Why...? I wonder why I made it in a movie format...

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:14.180
And to think I tried my best working on this too...

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.800
*inhales*

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:18.420
Nobody's even watching this, right?

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:22.440
Actually, it's okay, I think I know who the criminal is here...

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:26.520
First off! Without taking into account that I, myself, wrote the script...

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.780
I forgot that Twin-Tail was the older brother...

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:32.880
I messed up and put a woman's voice on him, right?

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:36.120
And then the younger brother, couldn't play the younger brother's part...

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.780
WELL!

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:39.640
Let's just say it was all my fault, but still, I was...

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:41.080
Quite dedicated to making it!

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:43.620
Like the movements, you know? At the end...

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:47.220
I added that cool-looking "A.I.Channel" logo too, right?

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:50.500
And I recorded the papa's voice, and the laughing sounds one by one too!

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:53.240
It took quite a long time to make!

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:55.000
Maybe some day, I'd like to redo it...

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.760
With the version of Twin-Tail being the older brother...

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:03.360
I understand that the people who watch this commercial shouldn’t be judging people by first appearances

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.700
In addition, you can probably feel how great A.I.Channel is...

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:09.120
You can feel it, right?

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:12.800
Ah! And then there's that! If I don't appear in the video, so then...

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:15.820
No one will bother watching it, right? This...

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:16.960
Ambitious young person!

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:20.020
In any case, how was that everyone?

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:22.620
But in particular, well, my recommendation would have to be...

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:25.760
“Ai’s Rehabilitation Factory" since we're experiencing a hot summer now, right?

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:27.980
I'd be happy if you could see me giving my all...

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:32.320
In my past videos this way...

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:35.300
From now on, even if I don't have anyone's help...

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:38.780
I think I’d want to keep uploading interesting and fun videos!

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:40.580
Please keep supporting me from now on!

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:42.680
This was Virtual Youtuber, Kizuna Ai!

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:43.880
See you later!

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:46.300
There's more at the end!

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:49.740
Translated by: score, Mitsukitten, sirrequiem, Lacrymac, Vortex, Zerch, and Bararo

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:57.620
My view count isn’t rising, you say?

00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:59.780
That doesn't matter at all!

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:02.080
That doesn't matter at all!

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:03.729
Yes! Oh-pa-pi!
