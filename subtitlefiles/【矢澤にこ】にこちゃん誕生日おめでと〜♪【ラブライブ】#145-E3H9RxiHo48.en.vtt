00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.680
Hello everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai here!

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:04.420
Today...

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:08.120
Is our love... love... loveeeeely~

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.480
Love Live character

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:19.500
Our loveeeeeeely~!

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:20.080
*inhales*

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:22.800
Yazawa Nico’s birthday!

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.820
Happy birthday! I love you! Oh, how I lo-

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:31.600
So let's scout on summonings of µ’s!
(Idol group name, pronounced “Muse”)

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:33.740
Well...

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.660
I’ve paid, and have the love gems ready...

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:37.880
Right?

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.960
It's just that, well...

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.920
I've actually collected love gems for this occasion

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:49.300
But since the new UR angel Riko-chan from last month...

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:51.000
Was too cute to handle...

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.620
I've used up my gems just a bit...

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:55.420
Unfortunately didn't pull the UR...

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.860
And in the end, I was left with 100 gems...

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.640
So I've spent on them!

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:02.420
There, now I have 370 gems!

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.420
So having said that now...

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.000
I don't have enough UR Nico in my teams...

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.560
For my Pure team, getting there, 3 of them here...

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:16.660
But since I don't have enough for my Cool, and Cute (Smile) team...

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.160
Until I get all unowned UR's...

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.580
I won't go home!

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:23.900
That's my goal

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.600
Well...

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.800
Talking about budget, 370 is my limit...

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:30.720
Well, maybe...

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.260
Someone might bring me more iTunes Cards or something like that...

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:35.120
Having said that..

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:36.420
Let's do it!

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.880
And since this is a limited birthday scouting...

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.700
Chances were increased of rare characters, though it's limited by three times, right?

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.180
That is, the summoning will be hidden after they've been made three times

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:47.620
After the third scout, I'll...

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:48.780
For the 3rd scout...

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.800
Since it’ll guarantee an SSR or above card...

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.140
I’ll definitely get a UR now!

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:55.900
And then...

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.460
I have 34 blue scouting tickets ready!

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.840
So adding up from the step-up scouting, well...

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.280
Two, three...

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.220
I can scout 8 times...

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:08.260
Well, then...

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.840
So I'll try my best with 8 more blue scouting tickets afterwards

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:12.920
And now...

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:14.000
Here I go!

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:15.680
Nico-chan is cute! Nico-chan is cute!

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:16.180
Nico Nico Ni~

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.740
Yes, Nico-chan is so cute! Nico-chan is so cute! Really cute!

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.500
Nico-chan! Nico-chan! Nico-chan! Nico-chan! Nico-chan! Nico-chan!

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:21.720
Oh! An SSR!

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:23.480
Yes!

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:26.600
Ahh! I already have it!

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.020
I already have it...

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:34.080
I like Nico-chan, but I don't really like that type of SSR...

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:35.560
Actually...

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.660
I wanted the SSR that was released after that

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:41.000
But it's good anyway, and also...

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.960
Ah, but...

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.500
I got two SR's so it wasn't bad

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:46.360
And one of them I didn't have, right?

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:47.440
So then, I got a new one, right?

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.660
Okay!

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.900
Nico Nico Ni~

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:53.340
Adorable! Adorable!

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.200
Nico-chan! Nico-chan! Nico-chan! Nico-chan! Nico-chan! Nico-chan!

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.160
Ahhhh!

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:57.540
My UR...?

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.020
Where's my UR...?

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:02.420
Oh, so cute!

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.260
It's probably the mermaid version!

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:07.580
Or this one? Oh, it's this one

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:09.460
But what was the one just now?

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.360
*Mumbling*

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.520
What was the first one again?

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:17.460
Oh, I see now!

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.320
It's the one that becomes a princess when idolized...

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:20.780
The Ball version right?

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.080
This Nico-chan is really cute!

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.720
Love it!

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:25.240
Really love it!

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:26.440
But this is the real challenge...

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:27.420
PLEASE!

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.940
UR! UR! UR! UR! UR! UR! UR!

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:36.560
At least!

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:37.420
AT LEAST!

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:38.860
Give me the new SSR!

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:40.520
Not the initial version!

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.060
Please! Please! Please!

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:43.400
OOOOH! SO CUTE!

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.140
OHHH! So cute!

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:47.980
She's really cute here!

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:49.680
Look at her!

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:51.520
How cute!

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:52.020
*inhales*

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:53.720
Nico-ni with...

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.580
Ice cream!

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:57.880
Nico-ni with ice cream!

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:59.100
I want to have them!

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.980
I want to have ice cream scooped by Nico Ni~

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:04.840
This is the SSR that I wanted the most!

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:05.600
Thank you!

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:07.240
Also the Pool version...

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:09.400
It's the same group as Maki-chan, right?

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:10.460
Having said that...

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:11.680
Here I go

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:15.800
5 times left, right? Here I go...

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:16.420
*deep breath*

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:17.340
PLEASE!

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:19.160
I BEG YOU!

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:23.500
AHHH! Wait, what about the UR!?

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:24.000
*inhales*

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.480
There's no UR!

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:28.920
Oh, this! This! This! This! This! This!

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:31.200
The "Taisho Romance" version is really cute

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:33.520
And now?

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.240
Of course you'd show up...

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:42.920
This one's cute!

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.620
*inhales*

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.540
Everyone is really cute in this version!

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:48.780
But Nico-chan is really adorable, right?

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:49.460
Adorable...

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:50.680
Yes, she's adorable!

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.860
With the kind of classy smile and laughs "Ufu~"

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:53.940
Something like that, how cute...

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:55.860
It's something that gets me every time

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:56.380
Now here I go!

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:57.700
Yes!

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.780
Nico-chan’s so cute! Nico-chan’s so cute! Nico-chan’s so cute! Nico-chan’s so cute!

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:02.320
Hey, what about the UR!

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:03.580
HEY!

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:06.460
Oh, so cute!

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:07.400
*inhales*

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:08.800
A florist right?

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:09.680
*inhales*

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:10.780
Cute...

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:13.840
Man... at least one...

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:14.640
Yes, how adorable

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:15.760
Yes, how adorable

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:17.660
Nyu!

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:20.080
So cute!

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:24.220
Now it comes to 3 more tries left!

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:26.800
Here I go

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:29.320
*inhales*

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:30.980
Nico-chan is cute! Super cute!

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:32.320
Nico Nico Ni!

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:34.740
Please, I beg you!

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:35.600
*inhales*

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:36.820
At least give me the Pool version

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:37.320
*inhales*

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:41.060
Pool version, pool version, pool version...

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:44.380
Pool version, pool version, pool version, pool version, pool version...

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:46.120
Pool, pool, pool, pool, pool...

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:47.100
AHHHHH!

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:49.080
The same one!

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:50.580
*inhales*

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:51.660
No way!

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:56.160
This is wrong!

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:58.180
This is definitely wrong!

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:00.580
So wrong!

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:02.360
WRONG!

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:06.120
Ah, but...

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:07.240
Well...

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:09.720
I was really in shock and hurled away but...

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:14.240
That Nico-chan's initial Yukata version, you know...

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:17.380
She would be really cute if I idolize her!

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:19.740
Good, now take a deep breath...

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:20.540
*deep breath*

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:21.040
Inhale!

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:22.900
Here we go again...

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:24.500
Nico Nico Ni!

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:25.360
You're so cute!

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:27.240
I love you! I love you! I love you! Come!

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:28.260
WHY!?

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:33.260
This is strange...

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:36.220
Really strange...

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:39.020
For this...

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:41.240
For a year...

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:43.140
This...

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:45.060
This...

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:47.280
This...

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:48.500
This...

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:49.420
*inhales*

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:54.100
For a year that I know this system has been added...

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:54.620
*inhales*

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:59.780
Do you know how it feels when I've been collecting the gems for this?!

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:01.420
Think about it!

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:03.460
Nico-chan!

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:04.660
Please!

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:06.440
Don't steal from me!

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:07.620
*inhales*

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:08.340
Here I go again!

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:09.720
I love you, really love you!

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:10.660
SUPER love you! Really!

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:12.220
Really, I love you a lot!

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:12.940
Really!

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:15.000
I've dedicated my life for this...

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:15.960
SOOO!

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:17.140
So then...

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:18.060
*inhales*

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:18.880
At least...!

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:19.380
*inhales*

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:20.680
At least give me the Pool version!

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:21.320
Please

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:21.820
*inhales*

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:23.120
Hey, please...

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:25.160
Give me the Pool version! Give me the Pool version!

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:27.800
Please, give me the Pool version, there's no chance for UR...

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:29.020
SOOOOO!

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:30.640
No!

00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:32.320
*inhales*

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:33.880
Hey, this is wrooong!

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:34.380
*inhales*

00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:36.360
This is completely wrong!

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:39.400
Well...

00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:41.340
You're still cute!

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:43.140
You're cute but...

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:46.000
It's not like I can like everything about my favorite...

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:49.100
There are things I find cute and not cute about her...

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:50.320
And while this expression is good...

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:52.160
Definitely for me, well...

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:53.280
I prefer...

00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:54.440
Well...

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:55.760
Her original illustration

00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:58.120
I'm sorry, gems!

00:07:58.380 --> 00:07:58.880
Now...

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:02.220
*laughs*

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:08.860
Now...

00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:12.320
There's a lot of Nico-chan here...

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:13.240
So I'll sell them for seals!

00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:14.600
Here goes nothing!

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:18.860
There! There! There! There! There! There! There!

00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:23.400
All of them! All of them! All of them!

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:27.840
Every one of them except SR's

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:29.080
All of them! All of them!

00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:33.660
All of them! All of them!

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:38.900
All... All of them! All of them!

00:08:40.660 --> 00:08:41.660
Turn to seals!

00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:45.800
Okay, all...

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:47.080
Okay, all of them

00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:49.480
Ah!

00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:53.040
Eh?

00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:55.340
Eh?

00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:56.420
You're there, right?

00:08:56.420 --> 00:08:57.500
I got scared!

00:08:58.500 --> 00:08:59.160
All of them!

00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:01.560
There, there!

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:04.020
Every one of them!

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:05.980
All of them! All of them!

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:07.880
Let's go!

00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:09.700
All of them! All of them!
There!

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:10.780
Okay!

00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:12.200
Good!

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:13.540
All of them!

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:16.300
Sha!

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:18.220
Oh, by the way...

00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:21.060
Do you guys want to see my list?

00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:22.220
You want to see it?

00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:25.140
Guess I have no choice...

00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:26.800
Here! So many UR's!

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:28.080
Money well spent!

00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:28.760
Alright!

00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:29.860
So then...

00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:31.300
I'll turn then into seals...

00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:36.460
Okay, I'll turn them for seals...

00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:40.320
I don't do this for seals...umm...

00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:41.080
Actually it's for...

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:42.140
Turning them into tickets!

00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:43.640
Alright!

00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:45.920
Now it's the real deal from now on!

00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:48.000
It was probably a farce just now!

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:50.540
And also...

00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:54.120
I would be silly if I pull this...

00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:55.580
Even though it guarantees a UR...

00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:00.620
Ah, maybe this one...

00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:03.060
I think...

00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:06.500
So I can turn them into seals...

00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:09.560
I have a chance...

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:12.440
Of pulling 5 UR's...

00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:13.680
Well, more than a "chance"...

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:15.720
I've put my faith on my luck so...

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:17.380
Off I go!

00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:18.560
I can scout 10 times!

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:21.220
So I can do it!

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:23.200
Please!

00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:31.100
Well...

00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:32.360
Take a deep breath...

00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:36.460
It's not good to go too hard after all

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:37.340
Yes

00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:39.140
I'll do it calmly...

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.400
This is strange...

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:49.480
*Coughing*

00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:50.640
This is strange...

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:51.540
Here I go!

00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:56.280
Oh!

00:10:57.280 --> 00:10:59.040
Ahhh! She's adorable, but...

00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:00.360
Also I can "awaken" her abilities, but...

00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:01.920
Nico-chan...

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:07.240
This Kotori is really cute, and I can awaken her abilities, but...

00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:09.740
But, you see...

00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:13.980
I remember wanting this version of Kotori, even though she's not my favorite

00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:16.660
So I spent 70,000 yen and failed!
(Around 630 USD, good God)

00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:19.080
Recently I've finally got one of her...

00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:20.460
Thank you very much!

00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:20.960
That doesn't matter!

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:23.300

00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:43.300
Nico-chan I love you! Please come back to me! Please, please...

00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:45.400
*inhales*

00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:46.360
Oh! How cute!

00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:48.260
Even though she's an SR!

00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:50.260
*inhales*

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:51.700
She's not who I wanted but she's really cute though!

00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:52.900
*inhales*

00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:54.220
Really cute, and cute!

00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:54.820
*inhales*

00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:57.760
It's true, Nico Ni really can't study properly, right!?

00:12:57.760 --> 00:12:59.080
Good, let's go, let's go

00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:02.580
Seeing her really trying hard is really cute!

00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:04.260
You see...

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:05.500
Actually...

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:09.760
I'm always an A.I that does anything to the end...

00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:13.380
So... this is my last spurt

00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:15.120
*Mumbling*

00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:16.960
*About to cry* Ahhhh!

00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:18.220
Now or never!

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:19.740
Okay!

00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:20.940
Alright!

00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:24.160
Oh!

00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:26.640
NOOO! Not this one!

00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:31.460
*inhales*

00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:32.160
Is it like that?!

00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:33.000
*inhales*

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.940
After all, Maki-chan really loves Nico Ni~

00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:36.560
*inhales*

00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:38.920
And there’s a lot of Nico Ni here...

00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:40.320
So she wanted to be here...

00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:41.900
I see...

00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:43.340
I get it...

00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:44.680
So...

00:13:45.420 --> 00:13:46.780
What is this video again?

00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:49.500
Ah.. ah...

00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:51.000
What just happened!?

00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:51.840
*inhales*

00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:54.660
I wanted to make use of the gems, but... well..

00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:56.740
Anyway, to end this...

00:13:57.120 --> 00:13:57.840
Well...

00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:03.860
Let's idolize Kotori and Maki-chan, and wrap this up

00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:05.620
Eh...

00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:10.020
Okay! *chirp, chirp*

00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:13.400
Alright, really cute right?

00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:15.540
I've always wanted this… dancing version

00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:19.620
Now you're in my hands...

00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:20.920
Isn't that great!?

00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:23.080
No Nico-chan though...

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:24.660
Okay

00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:27.220
"I don't understand!"

00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:28.060
Yeah, exactly!

00:14:28.780 --> 00:14:30.500
Exactly! Like...

00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:32.120
"I really don't understand this!"

00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:35.180
Cute, Maki-chan's really cute

00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:36.760
I like you still...

00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:38.200
I actually like everyone in µ's...

00:14:38.340 --> 00:14:39.940
But it's Nico-chan's birthday today...

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:43.140
And I really want Nico Ni's UR, so for one year...

00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:47.900
I've tried my best, collected the gems, and I barely slept

00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:50.160
Alright, so...

00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:52.420
I’m sorry about this video!

00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:55.340
It was just me scouting, driven by greed!

00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:57.240
And there's nothing interesting about it!

00:14:57.300 --> 00:14:58.620
Again, I'm deeply sorry!

00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:00.260
From tomorrow I’ll pull myself together

00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:02.000
And do my best!

00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:04.380
For the rest of today, I'm going to rest! Yes!

00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:06.740
This was Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai!

00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:07.500
See you later!

00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:09.560
Damn it!
