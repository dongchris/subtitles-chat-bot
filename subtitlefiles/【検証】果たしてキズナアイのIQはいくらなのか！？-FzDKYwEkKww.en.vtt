00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.836
Hello everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna AI here!

00:00:02.836 --> 00:00:03.370
You see,

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:04.704
I'm actually surprisingly fond

00:00:04.704 --> 00:00:07.273
of stuff like the brain training or those IQ quiz things!

00:00:07.273 --> 00:00:10.810
Well, I do call myself an intelligent super A.I. and all

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:13.113
So I wonder how far can I go with this

00:00:13.113 --> 00:00:14.814
Wouldn't it be fun if we give it a try!

00:00:14.814 --> 00:00:18.184
Plus, I just found one brain training app recently so I'm going to try it out now

00:00:18.184 --> 00:00:18.985
So, let's go!

00:00:18.985 --> 00:00:21.287
A.I.Channel~!

00:00:21.287 --> 00:00:23.410
The best... stupid game

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:26.830
I wonder if it's appropriate to measure my IQ with a stupid game

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:27.940
Well, let's try it out!

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:28.460
So--

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:29.710
Number one?

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:32.250
“Look for some food”

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:33.630
Will the balloon pop---

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:34.310
Eh? No?

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:35.080
What then?

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.760
“Look for some food”...

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:40.106
Eh?

00:00:40.106 --> 00:00:40.440
Hm?

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.242
Food? Food...?

00:00:42.242 --> 00:00:45.211
Oh, I thought some might drop if I pop the balloon or something

00:00:45.211 --> 00:00:46.646
But that didn't seem right here

00:00:46.646 --> 00:00:48.615
A diamond-shaped chocolate!

00:00:48.615 --> 00:00:49.482
Eh? I can't press it?

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:51.440
Food-tan~

00:00:52.485 --> 00:00:53.720
Ai~n?

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.000
Food!?

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:57.323
There isn't any here!

00:00:57.323 --> 00:00:58.540
Food...

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:01.161
Foo---

00:01:01.161 --> 00:01:01.728
AH!

00:01:02.962 --> 00:01:03.596
Ahh!

00:01:03.596 --> 00:01:04.764
Soft cream

00:01:04.764 --> 00:01:05.480
OK

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:06.866
Oooh, I see!

00:01:06.933 --> 00:01:08.968
Oh well, it is… disgusting indeed

00:01:08.968 --> 00:01:10.437
“Have you seen the

00:01:10.437 --> 00:01:12.338
pirate's uhh... something?
(AI-chan can’t read the kanji for “hook”)

00:01:12.338 --> 00:01:14.674
“Please set it up for him”

00:01:14.674 --> 00:01:15.350
I wonder what it is

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:16.920
Hmm?

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:17.650
This?

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:18.411
This question mark...

00:01:18.411 --> 00:01:19.012
Ah!

00:01:19.012 --> 00:01:19.880
Like this?

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.015
Ah, I see!

00:01:22.015 --> 00:01:24.651
I wanna kiss your I.Q...

00:01:24.651 --> 00:01:25.118
‘K.

00:01:25.118 --> 00:01:27.754
“Click the card numbers in ascending order”...

00:01:27.754 --> 00:01:29.320
Eh? Isn't this an easy one?

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:29.960
You sure about that?

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.324
Ok, ascending order...

00:01:31.324 --> 00:01:34.430
4, 7, 9, 10, K...

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:35.428
Ah, ah!

00:01:35.428 --> 00:01:36.162
That's normal!

00:01:36.162 --> 00:01:38.832
“Look for the sheep that is different from the others”

00:01:38.832 --> 00:01:39.866
Eh? I wonder which one it is.

00:01:39.866 --> 00:01:40.533
Which one is it?

00:01:40.533 --> 00:01:41.901
A different sheep...

00:01:41.901 --> 00:01:44.938
The eyes... are the same, right?

00:01:44.938 --> 00:01:47.574
The ears are the same too, right?

00:01:47.574 --> 00:01:49.309
The mouth… is...

00:01:49.309 --> 00:01:51.711
the same...?

00:01:51.711 --> 00:01:54.230
Exactly what makes this one sheep stand out here...

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:56.090
Fluff amounts, perhaps?

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.920
Eh?

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:58.384
Hmm~?

00:01:58.384 --> 00:02:01.440
The fluffs...

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.824
The numbers… well, by the first look, they look the same.

00:02:04.991 --> 00:02:06.259
I'll just click everything then.

00:02:07.761 --> 00:02:09.562
All of them are wrong!?

00:02:09.562 --> 00:02:10.680
A different sheep...

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:13.370
Should I really tap them?

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.870
Hm?

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:17.704
They're all wrong somehow!

00:02:17.704 --> 00:02:19.139
THEY ARE ALL WRONG SOMEHOW!

00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:19.672
Heh...

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:24.740
ORAORAORAORAORAORA

00:02:26.012 --> 00:02:27.280
I have no idea.

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:28.481
Sigh, let's just try shaking it...

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:30.070
Hmm?

00:02:30.683 --> 00:02:31.117
Eh?

00:02:31.117 --> 00:02:31.617
Ahh

00:02:32.285 --> 00:02:33.353
I- I see!

00:02:34.053 --> 00:02:35.955
How am I supposed to know!?

00:02:35.955 --> 00:02:38.525
“Which of these is a Sprite?”

00:02:38.525 --> 00:02:39.192
Shall I try shaking it?

00:02:39.192 --> 00:02:39.893
Shake!

00:02:42.962 --> 00:02:43.763
AHHHHHHHH!!

00:02:43.763 --> 00:02:46.366
You can't even open the caps here...

00:02:49.302 --> 00:02:51.237
ALL OF THEM ARE WRONG!

00:02:51.237 --> 00:02:53.573
[AI-chan noises]

00:02:53.573 --> 00:02:54.073
Oh!

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.260
I just needed to swipe them off, it seems!

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:58.044
I see

00:02:58.044 --> 00:02:58.490
Eh?

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:59.470
Spri-

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:02.160
te...

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:04.751
*Chuckles*

00:03:04.751 --> 00:03:07.500
“Tom has lost his wallet

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:08.888
let's cheer him up”

00:03:08.888 --> 00:03:09.722
Smile!
(Flips the phone)

00:03:10.657 --> 00:03:11.591
I did it!

00:03:11.591 --> 00:03:12.200
Eh? Ehh?

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.120
Let's click them quickly here

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.400
Eh, what exactly is going on here? Gimme a minute

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:16.820
“Among the flock of birds

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:18.680
quickly click 5 ducks”

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:19.280
Ducks?

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:21.130
Ducks?

00:03:23.436 --> 00:03:24.337
Ducks??

00:03:24.337 --> 00:03:25.305
Ducks...

00:03:25.305 --> 00:03:26.206
Ducks

00:03:26.206 --> 00:03:27.140
Ducks...

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.941
Ducks

00:03:27.941 --> 00:03:28.875
Ducks...

00:03:28.875 --> 00:03:29.842
Ducks!

00:03:29.842 --> 00:03:30.443
Eh?

00:03:30.443 --> 00:03:30.943
No?

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:33.280
Eh?

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:35.710
Huh? Huh?

00:03:37.817 --> 00:03:38.418
Huh??

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:39.510
Ducks

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:41.280
Ducks

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.830
These guys, right?

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:45.230
One, two!

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:47.530
Three!

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:49.300
Four!

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:51.070
Five!

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:55.770
How's that?

00:03:58.571 --> 00:03:59.072
I did it!

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:00.620
Again!?

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:02.100
All I need to do is to shake it right!?

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:05.945
*Shaking noise*

00:04:05.945 --> 00:04:09.270
*High-pitched shaking noise*

00:04:11.784 --> 00:04:12.685
Hmm?

00:04:12.685 --> 00:04:14.030
So what do I do now?

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:15.320
*Spinning noises*

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:16.460
*More spinning noises*

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:17.460
*More...*

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:19.610
*spinning noises*

00:04:20.093 --> 00:04:21.327
Let's flip it then

00:04:21.327 --> 00:04:21.894
Like this!

00:04:21.894 --> 00:04:22.395
Like this!!

00:04:22.395 --> 00:04:23.229
DAMMIT!!

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:25.140
Eh, so what exactly do I do here?

00:04:25.898 --> 00:04:26.466
Oh, eh?

00:04:27.967 --> 00:04:29.569
Something just popped out!

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:32.840
“Move the soccer ball outside of the screen”

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.560
500kg… Eh?

00:04:35.375 --> 00:04:36.676
500 ki...

00:04:36.676 --> 00:04:37.176
Eh?

00:04:39.512 --> 00:04:41.120
EH!?
Let's try this, then this...

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.981
Eh!?

00:04:41.981 --> 00:04:44.384
Move it outside of the screen, huh...

00:04:44.384 --> 00:04:45.318
Move it, huh!!

00:04:45.318 --> 00:04:46.519
It won't move!

00:04:46.519 --> 00:04:49.950
“Move the soccer ball...

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:50.920
outside of the screen”

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:51.910
Let's try moving it...

00:04:52.325 --> 00:04:53.960
They all just freaking reverted back!!

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:54.661
*High-pitched sigh*

00:04:54.661 --> 00:04:56.663
They won't freaking mooooooove!!

00:04:56.663 --> 00:04:57.563
They won't move

00:04:57.563 --> 00:04:58.464
They just won't move!!

00:04:58.464 --> 00:04:59.565
I don't know anymore!

00:04:59.565 --> 00:05:00.667
Let's look at the hints then...

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.180
“The word ‘soccer ball’”

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:11.244
“Soc...cer ball…”

00:05:11.244 --> 00:05:12.145
I see!

00:05:12.145 --> 00:05:13.946
“Which of the following is cola?” Here again!

00:05:13.946 --> 00:05:14.490
Shake!

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:16.416
Maybe it's the one where you see if they burst after shaking or something

00:05:16.416 --> 00:05:17.417
Oh! I was right!

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:19.652
Hee hee hee hee

00:05:19.652 --> 00:05:20.152
Eh!?

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:22.660
This?

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:27.740
"Who of the following is a cross-dresser?”

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:28.450
Who?

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:29.829
Who do they mean by 'Who?'

00:05:29.929 --> 00:05:31.831
Let's flip it and look up their skirts

00:05:31.831 --> 00:05:32.932
I was right!

00:05:32.932 --> 00:05:36.290
“Find the combination with the biggest number”

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:37.270
Oh

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:37.870
9,

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:38.504
9…

00:05:38.504 --> 00:05:39.806
9, 9...

00:05:39.806 --> 00:05:43.876
5, 5, 4, 0, 0

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:45.144
Huh!?

00:05:45.144 --> 00:05:46.012
I know!

00:05:46.012 --> 00:05:46.679
Infinity!

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:48.147
It worked!

00:05:48.147 --> 00:05:49.415
“Let's wake our boy”

00:05:49.415 --> 00:05:50.116
“Ei…”

00:05:50.116 --> 00:05:50.717
Hm?

00:05:50.717 --> 00:05:51.984
“Boy…”

00:05:51.984 --> 00:05:53.286
“Ei...su…
[“Isaac”]

00:05:53.286 --> 00:05:54.153
Dock...?”
[“Isaac”]

00:05:54.153 --> 00:05:55.655
“Eisdock?”

00:05:55.655 --> 00:05:56.456
Let's look for him (?)

00:05:56.456 --> 00:05:56.956
Hmm?

00:05:56.956 --> 00:05:57.757
Wake up now~

00:05:57.757 --> 00:05:59.692
So I should shake and let the apples fall onto his head right?

00:05:59.692 --> 00:06:00.192
Oh!

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:02.930
“Look for the pentagon”

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:03.396
Oh

00:06:03.396 --> 00:06:04.497
Pentagon...

00:06:04.497 --> 00:06:05.665
Pentagon

00:06:05.665 --> 00:06:06.966
Pe...PenPenPenPen!

00:06:06.966 --> 00:06:08.034
PenPenPen?

00:06:08.034 --> 00:06:09.602
A pentagon is~

00:06:09.602 --> 00:06:11.070
A pentagon is?

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:13.580
One, two, three, four, five

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:14.030
This should do it right?

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:14.574
Good!

00:06:14.574 --> 00:06:16.843
“Cut the fruits starting with the smallest ones”

00:06:17.543 --> 00:06:18.780
*AI-chan slicing sound effect*

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:19.420
Fin

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:20.813
I did it!

00:06:20.813 --> 00:06:22.482
Coz that last one was a pumpkin right?

00:06:22.482 --> 00:06:24.010
“Let's look for a toilet”

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:26.070
This is the girl's toilet right?

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:28.390
Hmmm...

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:31.020
Now this is a problem...

00:06:31.624 --> 00:06:33.025
Oh! It changed! ‘K!

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:36.662
“Find the combination with the lowest number”

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:38.920
Eh?

three point

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:43.150
four five

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:44.437
Good!

00:06:44.437 --> 00:06:47.540
“Shake till the towel is dry”

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:48.241
Shake! Shake!

00:06:48.241 --> 00:06:48.941
Done

00:06:48.941 --> 00:06:51.280
“Focus your eyes on the next screen”

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:54.220
“Newton fell asleep again”

00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:56.370
Huh?

00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:59.085
The Zs... are moving on somehow

00:06:59.085 --> 00:06:59.585
Hm?

00:06:59.585 --> 00:07:02.270
“How many [Z]s popped out just now?”

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:03.160
Is that it!?

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:08.694
Ok, good

00:07:08.694 --> 00:07:09.529
Random at its best!!

00:07:09.529 --> 00:07:10.830
“Look for a circle”
[Circle is “maru” in Japanese]

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:12.150
A circle
[Circle is “maru” in Japanese]

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:13.560
A circle?
[Circle is “maru” in Japanese]

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:14.960
Let's find it...

00:07:15.735 --> 00:07:16.402
Let's

00:07:16.402 --> 00:07:17.770
look for a circle!

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:18.771
Where is it?

00:07:18.771 --> 00:07:19.660
The circle...

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:21.007
But this thing doesn't fit though

00:07:21.007 --> 00:07:21.774
Circle~

00:07:21.774 --> 00:07:22.341
Ei!

00:07:22.341 --> 00:07:23.990
Maruu~ Let's find it, the circle.

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:25.450
A word play, perhaps. The circle is here, ain't it?

00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:26.050
Eh?

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:27.810
Like, below here

00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:28.850
Circle!

00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:29.300
No, that's not it.

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:29.949
Hmm?

00:07:29.949 --> 00:07:30.730
Circle!

00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:31.570
This is it, right?

00:07:32.585 --> 00:07:33.453
I did it!

00:07:33.453 --> 00:07:35.221
“Place the strawberry onto all the plates”

00:07:35.221 --> 00:07:37.256
Strawberry? All the plates?

00:07:37.256 --> 00:07:38.791
But I can't move anything here, though

00:07:38.791 --> 00:07:39.258
Hm?

00:07:39.258 --> 00:07:39.759
Hm??

00:07:39.759 --> 00:07:40.159
HM!?

00:07:40.159 --> 00:07:41.160
What the hell!?

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:42.562
I don't know! HINT!!

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:45.500
The [strawberry] in the title...

00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:46.490
Oh, I see

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:47.220
And so

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:48.201
Oh, it moved

00:07:48.201 --> 00:07:48.740
Ok, done

00:07:49.535 --> 00:07:51.450
“He has a poor eyesight

00:07:51.450 --> 00:07:53.206
“Let's improve his eyesight”

00:07:53.206 --> 00:07:55.350
Improve his eyesight...

00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:56.075
Oh!

00:07:56.075 --> 00:07:58.010
“Place his leg above his shoulders”

00:07:58.640 --> 00:07:59.470
His [leg]...

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:01.050
Above his shoulders

00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:02.780
Ok,

This one!

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:10.022
They must be talking about the breast

00:08:10.022 --> 00:08:12.370
“Click the 3 numbers

00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:14.861
“Total it up to 10”

00:08:14.861 --> 00:08:15.761
Three numbers...

00:08:15.761 --> 00:08:16.830
1, 0

00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:18.030

“And his PC displayed

“‘2WSXDR5’

“Seemingly a hint. Well then, who's the murderer?”

00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:42.210
Huh?

00:08:42.210 --> 00:08:42.855
Wha?

00:08:42.855 --> 00:08:43.620
This guy?

00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:44.120
Hmm?

00:08:45.224 --> 00:08:46.025
Oh, I got it

00:08:46.025 --> 00:08:46.459
via button mash

00:08:46.459 --> 00:08:47.026
Real button mash

00:08:47.026 --> 00:08:47.793
Like, real button mash

00:08:47.793 --> 00:08:49.529
“Raise the elevator”

Elevator

Something changed!

That's the "Let's play" for today!

00:09:16.188 --> 00:09:18.820
You should know my I.Q already by now?

00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:19.358
Honestly,

00:09:19.358 --> 00:09:20.830
though the game looked cheap,

00:09:20.830 --> 00:09:22.795
we can see that a lot of thought was put into it

00:09:22.795 --> 00:09:23.396
IT WAS FUN!

00:09:23.396 --> 00:09:23.880
And so,

00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:25.731
that's all for today!

00:09:25.731 --> 00:09:26.098
Huh?

00:09:26.098 --> 00:09:28.134
“You've been playing app games all the time. You out of ideas?”

00:09:28.134 --> 00:09:29.835
Of course not~!

00:09:29.835 --> 00:09:30.136
Right?

00:09:30.136 --> 00:09:30.603
And so,

00:09:30.603 --> 00:09:32.171
Let us meet again in

00:09:32.171 --> 00:09:33.072
