00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:26.180
What kind of performance will she provide us?

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:27.900
She’ll really be the main star

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:29.140
It’s true

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:30.280

The participant Kizuna Ai has an incredible speed, right?

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.540
What do you think, Kizuna Ai-san?

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:03.200
I definitely feel a great potential...

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.060
In regards to her ability to run

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.740
She might get an incredible time

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:08.800

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:33.480
It’s true

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.680

Red team, white team, do your best

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.160
Ah, now I’m really exhausted

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.400
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:10.920

The white team is the winner

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.820
Man, Kizuna Ai-san was incredible, right?

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.060
I lost count of how many balls she was able to hit

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.760
The last competition will be...

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:31.820
Tug-of-War

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.880
Participants, please prepare yourselves

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:36.060
We already arrived at the last event?

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.120
Today, the white team has a big difference to the red team...

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.420
But I wonder if the red team can turn the situation around

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.520
Man, they're really are far away, right?

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.600
It might be difficult for them

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.680
Next up, an announcement from the organizers...

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.340
Although it's the Autumn sports event, A.I.Channel style...

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.600
The team that wins the last event, "Tug-of-War", will be today's winner

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.700
HEY! HEY! THAT CAN'T BE!

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.160
No! That's unfair! What was I doing until now?

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:03.980
The white team deserves the victory!

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.900
The red team is cheating! Cheating! Cheating! Cheating!

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:09.060
Definitely everything is a show...

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:10.900
It's an expected outcome

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.220

Man, it became a sports competition that will be shaped in history, right?

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:15.740
