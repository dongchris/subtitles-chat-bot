00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.400
What's up guys!

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:06.500
Just want to say huge thanks to Xiaomi for partnering with us to make this video

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.600
Xiaomi is actually behind some of the world's coolest tech like these superfast charging power banks

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:14.180
or these really awesome portable electric scooters

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:18.620
We're actually gonna be doing giveaway so stay tuned to the end of the video to find out how you can win one of these

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.700
for now, enjoy this video!

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:36.300
Hey guys, it's officially summer break we're outside soaking up the sun

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:42.080
We got our mimosas here. Cheers, and I'm just living.. wait... Oh, no!

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:43.160
What's wrong?

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.140
-My battery's low can I use your external battery for a second?

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.240
What percent you at?

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.000
That was the most hurtful thing you've ever asked me. I'm at 10%

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:53.920
Talk to me at 3.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:55.720
Girl, give me a charge!

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:03.260
Ugh! You know, you are what's wrong with this generation. So concerned about your social media and your gadgets

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.620
why can't you just sit back and enjoy this beautiful day?

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:09.460
It's dead.

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:10.480
No!

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.420
Ugh, it wasn't charging mine either. What are we gonna do?

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.360
There's Ray, he always has so much techy stuff. I'm sure he'll have an extra battery

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.740
What's up, ladies?

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:40.580
I have so many questions, but first we need to charge our phones. Do you have an external battery?

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:42.020
Yeah? I have five

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.520
Thank God!

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:43.420
...at home.

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.560
Ugh can't you just... scooter back?

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.680
I will not put extra wear and tear on my baby.

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:54.020
Let's just ask someone here.

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.300
There

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.300
It's... beautiful

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.460
All right, I'm going for it.

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.260
Hey, hey ask for us too.

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.440
Man, you're on your own.

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:34.120
Hey! Mind if I sit here?

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.200
Sure, go ahead.

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:35.900
Cool

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.220
Oh! What book are you reading?

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.240
Uhm? It's just a legal thriller

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.180
Oh! Lawyers...

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.100
What are the charges?

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.240
What?

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.760
Assault on battery

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.520
Mm. I'm gonna go ahead and move over... over there... the sun

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.680
it's... shifting... Nice to meet you!

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:06.880
Not it's not though..

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:09.920
Damn it

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:14.420
What was that?

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:16.950
I couldn't have been any clearer

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:18.080
Let me try

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.320
Hey! I've got charm

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.640
What a cool guy!

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.050
Well?

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:53.240
Well what?

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:54.580
The battery?

00:03:54.820 --> 00:04:01.020
Oh shoot! My bad, I completely forgot to ask. He saw my scooter and he has one also so we ended up talking about that.

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:04.300
He used to be a pro skater, too. What a guy...

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:08.720
Ugh! Okay, this is ridiculous. I didn't want to resort to this but...

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:20.460
Hi! I'm Michelle. I couldn't help, but notice you over here, you're just so cute, you know

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:26.400
Bricen, nice to meet you. Yeah, I think I saw you over there with your other friend.

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:28.080
I don't know her

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.460
Hey, what's this?

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:34.240
Oh, uhm...

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:40.980
Me? Is this for..? Me? Aha?

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:48.620
He's packing his stuff we scared him away

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:55.580
Hey! Sorry, I'm late guys. What's going on? You look super creepy huddled here like this

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:57.460
All of our phones are about to die

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:01.540
so we're trying to get this guy over here to let us use this external battery for a second

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:04.500
We tried being friendly, we tried flirting,

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:07.980
hilarious puns. Nothing's worked on him

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:13.920
Well let me show you how it's done

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:20.180
Hi!

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:21.960
Oh hi

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.180
The reception is terrible here, huh?

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:28.560
Tell me about it. I've been on 4G for the past hour

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.500
Gegegeeez that sucks

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:35.920
Well I've got a mobile hotspot if you want to use it..?

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:39.620
Really? Sure, yeah, that'd be great!

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:42.400
Oh no, it's...

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:45.560
out of battery!

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:49.660
Wait! Here... you can charge it with my power bank!

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:52.440
Perfect!

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:58.660
What a match we are huh? You keep sending me electricity, I'll keep sending you signals

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:00.580
My name is Donna by the way.

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:02.780
Bryson. What's your password?

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:04.460
Rain drops hot spot.

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:07.240
No. I meant, to your heart.

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:12.520
Oh, I like what you're networking with!

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:16.000
Wi-Fi...t the inevitable

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:19.660
Did you want to grab by to eat cuz I'm on my way out anyways?

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:20.160
Yeah!

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:24.120
Cool, cool sounds good! I actually know this awesome a little burger place.

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:25.760
I thought you'd never ask!

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:27.620
It's the best. It's got...

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:30.160
What the hell just happened?

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:32.440
I thought my puns where way better

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:35.680
Dating is weird nowadays

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:42.480
Well hope you guys like that video! I think we can all relate to the frustration of having a phone that is not charged.

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:46.460
Again, thanks so much to Xiaomi for making this video happen! You can check out their power bank Pro

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:49.200
and the electric scooter on Amazon, in the links below

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:52.640
As you guys saw in the video the power bank pro is perfect for when you're on the go,

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:56.080
it stores a lot of power it can charge like an Android phone two and a half times

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:58.840
or an iPhone 7 like four times, on one charge

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:03.460
And also the electric scooter is a ton of fun! It's lightweight and portable, easy to carry around

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:07.760
it can go up to 15 miles per hour and last up to 18,6 miles

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:12.720
So be sure to follow Xiaomi online! Follow their Instagram and Facebook and all their socials to find out more about their products

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:17.120
