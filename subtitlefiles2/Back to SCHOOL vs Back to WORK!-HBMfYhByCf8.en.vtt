00:00:00.159 --> 00:00:04.709
Hey everyone! Big thanks to Google Assistant for this paid partnership. Now, let's get ready to watch our video.

00:00:06.819 --> 00:00:08.819
Turn off the lights.

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:10.560
Cool.

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.420
Thanks Lauren, for coming back-to-school shopping with me.

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:21.300
Oh, no problem.

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.160
I wanted to make sure my little cousin's all set, and I had to get stuff from my office anyway, so.

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:27.880
Oh, my gosh, that's so funny. We're like doing the same thing!

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.420
I'm going back to school and you're going back to work.

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:31.820
Huh-huh. I guess.

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.020
Except those two are very different.

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.520
Really? How so?

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:40.300
Well, see how you're getting like ten different colored pens?

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:45.260
Well, yeah. These gels are for three super cute DIY planners I'm making from this YouTube Video I saw,

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.380
and I need multi-color highlighters so my notes can look pretty.

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:50.640
Yeah, this is all I'm getting.

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:52.940
No DIY planner?

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:56.960
Well... what else is different?

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:02.500
*Gasp*

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:03.960
Tomorrow's the first day of school.

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:05.620
I can't sleep!

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.680
How is it Monday already?
*groan*

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:12.040
Okay Google.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.480
Wake me up at 7:34 am.

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.400
'OK, your alarm is set for tomorrow at 7:34 am.'

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.040
*Crickets chirping and Lauren snoring*

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:27.600
*Alarm goes off*

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:28.700
Let's do this!

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:34.480
*Alarm goes off*

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.200
Oh no no no no no no no no...

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:50.780
*upbeat music*

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:59.100
*coffee machine*

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.180
*upbeat music*

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:11.880
Okay Google.

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:13.980
How long will it take me to get to work?

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.880
'With heavy traffic it will take you 1 hour and 32 minutes to drive to work.'

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:29.020
*upbeat music*

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.440
Oh my gosh, guys. We need to take a first day of school selfie.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.360
*They agree*

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.080
Okay Google. Take a selfie.

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:49.880
Hey Phyllis.

00:02:49.886 --> 00:02:50.760
Hey Bruce.

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:52.880
How was your weekend?

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:54.080
Fine.

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:57.480
What'd you do?

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.740
Stuff.

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:00.620
*Elevator bell*

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.320
I did stuff too.

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.180
OMG Vicki, I love your outfit.

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.060
Oh, thanks. I just got a whole new back-to-school wardrobe. Wait.

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.300
Do you wanna see pics? Or do you want to wait and be surprised?

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:18.060
Pics.

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:19.200
What—wait—no—surprise me.

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:20.760
No.

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:21.400
Pics.

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:22.500
Come on.

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.500
*Printer sounds*

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:28.760
Hey Lauren!

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.220
Uh, is that a new cardigan? It's nice.

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:32.620
Uh, nope.

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:34.460
Been wearing it for three years.

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:36.460
*Moment get extremely Awkward*

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:43.600
Hey! Can I try some of your pizza?

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.380
Well I would let you, but I have crust issues.

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:47.640
*Laughter*

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:48.880
I hate you guys.

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:49.920
You are the worst.

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:59.780
Tell me a joke.

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:01.540
This might make you laugh:

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:05.340
Whoever invented knock-knock jokes should get a "no bell" prize.

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:06.980
*chuckle*

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:14.620
Hate to break it to you, cuz'.

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.620
All this excitement that you feel?

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.020
Gotta enjoy it while it lasts.

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:21.000
Why does it have to end?

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:25.220
What does this feeling of passion and motivation have to slowly disappear?

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:28.260
You're too young to understand.

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.700
Well, if getting older means understanding more,

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:36.720
wouldn't you understand that it's even more important to be excited about life as you get older?

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:46.460
*Upbeat music*

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:47.740
*Elevator bell*

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:57.120
*Upbeat music*

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:58.200
Pizza! (slow motion)

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:00.040
*Upbeat music*

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:03.820
Yahh! Back to work!

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:08.480
God. That was exhausting.

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:08.980
*Elevator bell*

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:14.260
God, I hate Mondays.

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:23.540
PIZZAAAAAAA. Pizza.

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:27.860
Hey, are you actually traumatized from the pizza now?

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:32.460
Pizza!!

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:35.380
**Phil laughs**

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:36.920
You guys have graduated!

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:38.120
Friends: YAY!

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:40.420
**Phil laughs**

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:42.420
Pens. PENS!

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:44.360
Whoa. Boop boop boop boop.

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.180
**Phil laughs**

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:52.340
God I hate Mondays.

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:58.120
Just call them Migrane Mondays.

00:05:58.900 --> 00:05:59.620
What?

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:07.440
All right, we know going back to work isn't always that bad. And going back to school is definitely not always that fun.

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:08.320
But either way,

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:09.840
