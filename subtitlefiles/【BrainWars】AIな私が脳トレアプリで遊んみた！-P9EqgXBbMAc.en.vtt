00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:03.080
It's the virtual youtuber, Kizuna Ai!

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:03.760
Today...

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:04.760
I'm playing this!

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.000
It's a game app called Brain Wars

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.320
This is a brain-training themed app

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:14.520
that you can play in realtime
against players around the world!

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.600
With over 10 million downloads in 8 months,

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.340
this game is being played in over 150 countries!

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:23.620
Isn't it amazing?!

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:25.560
I want to start playing immediately!

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:27.720
This is my account

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.360
and as you can see, I just started!

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:32.200
Isn't this baby chick too cute?

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:33.480
Player level

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:35.980
Eh?

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:37.320
Everything's a question mark!

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:38.740
You can see the names, though

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:40.400
Turtle, turtle...

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:42.220
Rabbit... is usagi
[rabbit in Japanese]

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:44.860
La-e-no, what's that?
[Lion]

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:46.140
Everyone, do you know what that is?

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:47.260
I have no idea...

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.760
Maybe it's an evolution of the rhino?
[similar... pronunciation? I have no idea]

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:51.700
It's a phoenix!

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.940
A phoenix, isn't that so cool?!

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:58.260
I will work hard so that I can become Phoenix Ai!

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.760
In this game, you can battle
with people around the world.

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.640
But I'm just starting out.

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:10.140
So I'm going to begin with
some practice rounds!

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.700
There's an option here called training...

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.660
there's quite a lot of options.

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:17.020
Flick Master...

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:18.380
Rock Paper Scissors Battle!

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:19.580
that sounds familiarly unfamiliar...

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:20.080
Ah!

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:22.600
Quick Eye!

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.200
Quick Eye! Doesn't that sound fun!

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:26.420
Eye - it says Ai!
[pronounce eye/Ai out as a-i]

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.500
I'm going to practice with Quick Eye!

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.460
According to the instructions,

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.060
you find the matching card and tap it...

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:36.680
So it's like testing your reflexes, right?

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:37.560
Lets go!

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.240
O...J...B...3...

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.980
A...F...H...D...

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:47.100
[mumbling]

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:49.420
4...4, 4!

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:50.820
1, 8...8, 8!

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.640
G, G...0, 9

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.180
7, 7, 7, 7....C

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.260
Ah... well...

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:05.520
I've got to give it another go

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:06.440
Get that 100%

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:07.080
Until I can get it...

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:08.500
Since it's Quick Eye, Ai!

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:09.840
There's no meaning if I can't get 100%!

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.220
Once more... start!

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.500
[concentrating hard]

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:31.100
Oh...

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.540
Oh... I got it! Take a look!

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.460
Score: 100%!

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:39.760
Welcome back everyone!

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.020
It's the 100% perfect scoring
Quick Eye, Kizuna Ai!

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:47.660
I feel like I can win it all,
since I've already perfected training

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.760
You know, since my score is 100%~~

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.780
But in the off-chance that I lose,

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:55.880
the one in a thousand,

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:57.060
or one-in-a-million chance,

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.380
I have something special I'm preparing right now,

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.740
I have many funny stories I've been collecting...

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:05.800
and I'll share them with everyone!

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.680
Then, lets go right into battle with humans like you!

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:10.880
Battle, start!

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.360
I wonder where this person is from...

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:18.960
China!

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:21.940
Good luck!

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:23.980
Eh... Quick Eye isn't an option...

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:27.960
Quick Eye wasn't an option, right?

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.380
Well whatever, lets begin!

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:32.580
Brain training, easy mode

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:34.520
I've memorized it!

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:36.780
I'm a genius.

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:39.840
I'm a genius!

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.040
I've got it, I've got it!

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:45.520
I've got it!

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.440
I've got it... ah...

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:55.220
Did I lose... wait, Quick Eye isn't here!

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:56.280
Touch the Color

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:01.860
This is easy

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:03.460
Green, yellow, yellow

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:05.820
Uh... green, green, yellow

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:07.860
Uh... yellow, yellow, green

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:10.580
[mumbling]

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.200
I won this round!

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:23.380
I won!

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.240
Ah, Quick Eye is available! Quick Eye!

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.960
Quick Eye, my perfect training, quick!

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.480
I've got good luck!

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:33.580
Lets go, time to show my true potential

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:55.840
Oh... Ah, I won!

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:00.137
Oh!

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.620
Oh! I won!

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:04.520
Everyone,

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:06.460
if you want to play this game,

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:08.680
it's in the description,

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:10.740
so I hope you play!

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:12.800
This time, it's my victory!
