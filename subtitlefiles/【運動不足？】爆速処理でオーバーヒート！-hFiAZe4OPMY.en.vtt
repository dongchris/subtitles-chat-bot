The app that I showed you some time ago, called "The Dark Knight and The White Demon King"

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:08.620

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:09.780
(≧∀≦)

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:14.320

13) Added other improvements

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:37.380
I'm tired.

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:38.540
With that being said...

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:39.980
... There are a lot of changes, but...

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:41.320
... I'll show you every single one of them...

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.860
... Although, it is possible that the duration of this video is not enough, so...

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:46.400
Let's do some summonings!

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:49.560
Personally, what I like the most of this game is...

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:50.460
You know...

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:53.300
... I enjoy watching cute girls and...

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.380
... I wonder if I can make them feel what I feel.

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.040
The girls that I want but I don't have yet are...

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:04.460
Heru, Aphrodite, Gabrielle, Leviathan, Freya, Hera, Belt, Wadatsumi, Armaiti, Michael, Ame no Uzume...

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.480
...Amaterasu, Jeanne d'Arc,  Metatron, Ameretat, Tsukuyomi, Nidhug, Paimon, Dorothy.

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.620
Nidhug is the one that I want the most!

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:12.840
In that case, I'll start now.

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.960
First, I'll do the limited summoning of 10 characters per day called "Treasure Summoning"
*The "Treasure Summoning" ends on September 24*

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:16.900
Let's do it!

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.240
I have more chances of getting Nidhug-chan, so here I come.

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:22.500
I can do it!

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.760
Ah, eh? Maybe I won't get her.

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:26.460
Eh?

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:28.520
I will do it, right?

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:29.920
And now...!

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:31.640
Now...! Yes!

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.920
Oh! Oh!

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:33.940
Just a little more!

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:36.320
Ah! Eh? Eh?

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:37.400
Hmm...?

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.580
Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:40.540
Ah! Ah!

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:41.860
This is my chance!

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:42.640
Ah! Ah! Ah!

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:45.520
Aaaahhh!

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.920
That's not the one that I wanted but she's adorable!

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.960
Amazing!

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.400
Amaterasu-chan!

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.200
She's so adorable! She's floating.

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.940
Is she...

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.080
Is she wearing a miko dress?
(Japanese Priestess)

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.900
This kind of...

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.940
... Japanese clothes are amazing, don't you think so?

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:03.980
*Let me hear what you have to say.*

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:05.900
Ah, man. You're so adorable!
*I hope that something good will happen to you*

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:07.020
Thank you very much.

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:09.540
Oh! You also get an extra reward.

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.660
I wonder what will I get. Hoi!

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.480
Ah! I won the big prize!

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:15.780
Amazing, I'm so lucky.

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:17.060
In that case, now...

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.980
I'm going to do the Wizard Summoning.

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:21.340
There she is, right?

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:22.780
Nidhug-chan.

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.500
Come to me!

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:27.480
One, two...

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:28.440
Alright, let's go!

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:30.640
And now...!

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:31.320
Yes!

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:32.380
One more...!

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.680
... Time!

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.760
Eeeehhh? Ah!

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:37.120
AH!

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.800
*Ai-chan is feeling insecure*

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:41.580
I have a bad feeling about it.

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:42.740
*Go for it!*

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:43.860
Wow, she's so adorable!

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.260
She encouraged me.

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.340
I'm encouraged now!

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.520
Aahh... Man...

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.060
Aaahh... Ahhh... Man...

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:53.240
Well...

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.420
... This kind of things happen sometimes, right?

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:58.820
I didn't have enough gems, so...

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:59.820
I bought more!

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:00.360
Tehee~

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:01.560
In that case, and lastly...

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.040
... I'll do the summoning that's limited to one time called "Start Dash: Divine Prison"

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.260
PLEASE! PLEASE!

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:09.540
Nidhog-chan!  Plea...!

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.955
Ah! Ah! Ah! The moon is red! That means...!

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:13.640
Ah, that's right, it's guaranteed that you'll get one character.

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.960
I'll be more than happy if I get more than 2.

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.300
And now...

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.280
And now...

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:24.620
Uuuuhhh!

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:25.760
Alright!

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:26.260
Alright!

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.420
I wonder if I'll get a new character.

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:29.660
Oh! Oh! Oh!

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:31.920
AH! That's not what I wanted but...!

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.460
... Her breasts, her thighs and the line of her butt too...!

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:36.360
... They're amazing.

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:39.400
Ah, oh! Eh?

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:41.920
I already had it! ♪

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:43.680
Well, I had her, right?

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.280
*Let's have some fun.*

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.460
I had intentions of having fun, but...

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.340
In order to have fun with others...

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.560
... You have to have fun by yourself first...

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.080
... And, as I wasn't able to get Nidhog-chan... I didn't have fun, so...

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.980
Well, but even so...!

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:02.540
Even when I wasn't able to get another character, I raised the levels of my abilities. So I'm slowly gathering more power!

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.235
What do you think?

00:04:04.235 --> 00:04:07.355
The content of this update is pretty interesting, isn't it?

00:04:07.395 --> 00:04:10.805
Make sure to read the latest changes in the game, okay?

00:04:10.805 --> 00:04:14.560
You'll be able to get gems if you read it completely.

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.300
Man, definitely...

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.580
A summoning where you can get a lot of cute girls make me feel excited, right?

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:24.340
Alright, alright, alright. Even if I didn't get Nidhog-chan...

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.280
... I got Amaterasu-chan, a new SSR character.

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.940
So I'll keep doing my best from now on!

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:33.440
This has been Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai! See you soon!
