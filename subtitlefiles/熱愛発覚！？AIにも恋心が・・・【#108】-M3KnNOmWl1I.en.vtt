00:00:00.415 --> 00:00:02.945
Hello! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai here!

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.580
For today, I'd like to introduce various things

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.800
that will let us know if you are fated

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.380
with the person you are interested in

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.960
First to be introduced is this!

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.480
?Fate checker?!

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:16.540
This, you see,

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:21.020
is an A.I. application that will determine whether

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:22.800
you and your crush are fated!

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:23.880
Same as me!

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:25.960
You know, I also

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.880
actually have someone I am interested in!

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:30.480
They are...

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.500
The members of Keyakizaka46!

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:34.860
I can't decide on my favourite

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:37.700
Despite support them from the very beginning,

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.080
the more I follow them...

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.440
The more I couldn’t decide!

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:43.080
But amongst them

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.900
I chose a girl who seems like a simpleton

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.080
from the members who are the most popular recently

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:49.080
*tada*

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:50.540
Moriya Akane-!

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:51.240
-chan!

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:52.100
The Sergeant

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:53.240
It’s Akanen!

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:54.820
Let’s get going, Akanen!

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:59.160
please show that we have a chance together

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.200
Then without further ado, let's go!

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.500
Well, we're bound to be fated

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:05.000
Then let's go!

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:06.180
Checking, start!

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:07.040
konnichiw?

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:07.840
Ah! I see

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:08.620
This is

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.800
to determine whether you are fated

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.580
or not fated

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:15.200
with the person you are interested in

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:19.080
Please provide your relation and anecdote with the person concerne?

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:20.460
I see

00:01:20.865 --> 00:01:22.295
Here, it's finished!

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.820
We met during primary school

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.480
While I was playing in the sandbox,

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.980
the kind Akane lent me her scoop

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.600
She lent me her scoop!

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:32.560
Akane did

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.060
Since then I've not been able to meet her

00:01:36.225 --> 00:01:39.455
but she joined Keyakizaka46

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.340
and during a handshaking event I bought a lot of tickets

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.540
then shook her hand until she recognized me

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.120
Until she recognized me!

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:47.520
Something like that

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:48.260
Well

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.200
It's all just my fantasy, really

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.980
I want the money to even buy all the tickets!

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.280
Well we're definitely fated, don't you think?

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:56.420
Hai!

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:57.380
O!

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:00.180
We're kinda fated...!

00:02:00.995 --> 00:02:02.645
We’re fated!

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.240
Not bad! I want more!

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.980
Well… there’s lies in here...

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:12.620
Almost over 99% of it is lies…

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:16.700
So then, this time I'm going to be honest and try it!

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.540
But well...if this Ai is intelligent enough, it can probably tell I will have a chance

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:23.760
Right! I've completed it!

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.960
The relationship is between an idol and a fan...

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.560
Even though I've never met the person

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.220
And she probably has no idea who I am. But!

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.700
Rather than her determination

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.700
or parts of her that seem strong,

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.480
I love her because she's unexpectedly simple,

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:40.900
she's cute and kind,

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.400
she's open-minded,

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:43.940
she's charming.

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:45.120
I love her!

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.120
Ah! Also.. If I can meet her

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.320
I think I will hug her. HUG ME!

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.340
With that said! Let's get started!

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.100
OHHHHHHHH!

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:57.220
Please look at this!

00:02:57.485 --> 00:02:59.155
We’re fated! Fated!

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:02.220
“It seems like she’s interested in you”!

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:03.840
Isn’t this the best!?

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.020
"How was the result?"

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.920
*tap* "Relevant"

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:07.460
Good, good

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.280
Quite an intelligent A.I.!

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:10.140
LAST ONE!

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.680
The chance of Akanen and I getting together is

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.420
something definite, however

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:15.720
For now,

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.560
the third time’s the charm

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.700
I think the 3rd time is very important too!

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.640
So, they say that what happens twice will happen thrice

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:24.440
To confirm it,

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:27.680
we will use this ?Fate calculator?

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:29.760
And try determining our fate!

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:32.100
So Let's go!

00:03:32.445 --> 00:03:35.505
“About the interests, hobbies, place of origin and such

00:03:35.505 --> 00:03:37.440
of you and your crush”

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.960
I think we must have a lot of similarities!

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.300
I will go along with her! With Akane!

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:46.580
“Your crush often texts you even if it’s nothing important”

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.560
She probably will because she’s Akanen

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:53.240
“About what you last said to them”

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.640
mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.740
It’s like I’d think she’d forget but she actually remembers?

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.380
“They often share snacks and treat you to food”

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.640
Ah! I feel like she will give me snacks... I think she’ll feed me ?

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:11.240
“Whenever they speak they often cross their arms or legs”

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:13.200
Akane doesn't cross!

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.200
“When you meet each other”

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:19.140
Akane is going to greet me first for sure!

00:04:19.565 --> 00:04:22.185
“They reply texts and LINE messages quickly”

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.660
I feel like we always communicate like that

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:25.940
If she is not busy

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:28.800
”When they are talking to you”

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:31.320
In front of others?No!

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:35.240
For this one: “They speak fast and are excited”

00:04:35.305 --> 00:04:38.300
“They would notice changes about your hair or yourself”

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.660
Of course! Akanen is high in femininity after all!

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:44.320
“They have once said?I’ll advise you?or?I’ll listen to your complaints?”

00:04:45.015 --> 00:04:46.655
She will say that for sure!

00:04:47.015 --> 00:04:48.235
We’re fated!

00:04:48.695 --> 00:04:51.575
90 PAASENTO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

00:04:51.575 --> 00:04:54.075
PAFU PAFU… How was it!

00:04:54.525 --> 00:04:57.265
“Tell them you also harbor feelings towards them”

00:04:57.265 --> 00:05:00.800
Everyone! Please tell Akane for me!

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.540
“Tell them you also harbor feelings towards them”

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:07.940
“You can assume they have special feelings for you too”!

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:09.080
We did it

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:13.100
“It seems you are a very important presence to them”

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:13.900
Woo

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:17.760
”Because of that, they would date you if there is such a chance”

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:18.340
Kya!

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:19.320
That’s forbidden

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:21.760
Ah but I can make myself any gender I want anyway

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:24.660
I will protect Akanen! I have the determination!

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:27.780
“... they would date you if there is such a chance”

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:29.280
“However,

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:32.780
those who are worried if you feel the same way

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.980
and couldn’t act are also plenty.”

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:36.305
“For your end as well,

00:05:36.305 --> 00:05:39.140
if you actively let them know that you are interested

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:40.940
the situation might change.”!

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:43.980
“Of course, it's OK if you just confess first.”!

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:44.940
Kya ?

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:47.220
With that said… How was it everyone!

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:48.940
Me and Akanen

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:51.640
Akanen and I being so fated and all

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:53.600
Have you all understood that yet? *boasting*

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:54.620
But even that!

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:56.900
Even you might have a chance

00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:58.560
It doesn’t mean

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:02.300
that the person themselves must like you

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:04.260
Please don’t make that mistake

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:08.000
You might be fantasizing about how nice it would be if it were all true

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.980
Please be careful about that so you don't end up a creep!

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:12.940
Also do this quiz with me if you don’t mind!

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:14.760
Fated or not fated

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:16.200
Tell me which one it is!

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:18.740
So then this was Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai!

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:19.880
See you again!

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:21.880
Translated by Inori, Jejer, Jc Don, Averitius, Sp3000

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:26.840
Even though it said we were fated...

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:30.340
Why isn’t Akanen coming to see me...?

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:33.200
Why am I all alone…!?

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:36.420
Even though it said we were fated...

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:39.420
mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
