00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.780
Hello everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna AI here!

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:05.740
I’m the Japan Tourism Ambassador

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:07.960
The work of a Japan Tourism Ambassador...

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:10.820
Consists of introducing Japan to the entire world

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:13.980
It’s because of that, that they let me make several videos, but...

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:16.640
...There’s still a lot that's left to say

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:21.380
It's because of that, that I'll be presenting: "These are the Japanese"!

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:23.220
In this case, let's start at once!

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.800
A.I.Channeeeel!

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.140
One of the positive aspects of Japan

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.060
It's that it's a very safe country!

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.840
Even if you lose an item, they make sure to bring it back to you

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.420
And even though you walk alone at night...

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.260
...There's a lot of safe places!

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.780
Even women don't need to worry!!

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.940
But plastic umbrellas that are left in stores...!

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.820
...Tend to be taken by another person!

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.980
It's a very safe place and everyone is really friendly!

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:44.500
But...!

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.040
They alway steal...!

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.920
...Plastic umbrellas!

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:48.940
Another positive aspect...

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.500
...Is that Japan is following a policy of Free Barriers

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:52.960
Creating an environment of easy access...

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:55.520
...For a lot of people...

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.480
That’s a very positive aspect, right?

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.140
But the mechanical escalators...!!

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:00.740
In posters and announcements, it's said...

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:03.200
..."If you go up without walking, use the second line"

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:05.320
And in reality, everyone leaves an open line

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:07.860
And there is a rule that this line is used to advance by walking

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:08.680
Also...

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:09.520
Also!

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.160
The line changes depending on the region, whether it's Kantou or Kansai...

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.520
...It’s the right or the left line

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.020
How are you supposed to know that!?

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.140
That what they say is different from the internal rules that everyone follows

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:19.420
Doesn't it seem strange?

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.680
If those rules exists, make sure to say them!

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:23.740
Another positive aspect is...

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.960
...That in Japan, exists the culture of "Honorific speech"

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.480
Superiors are respected

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.440
I think it's an extremely good culture

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:30.200
In addition...

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.660
...The fact that everyone takes care of these rules...

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:34.720
...Is one of the positive aspects of Japan, right?

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:35.940
For example, polite language
(More information on Wikipedia: "Honorific speech in Japanese")

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:37.140
Respectful language
(More information on Wikipedia: "Honorific speech in Japanese")

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.180
And humble language!
(More information on Wikipedia: "Honorific speech in Japanese")

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:39.680
No!

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.600
There are too many honorific languages!!

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.600
And I don't understand the difference between them!

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.160
I know that creating and protecting certain rules is something very positive of Japan, but...

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:49.520
...There's so many rules...

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:51.560
...That I can't grasp them all!!

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.040
Honorific speech is a language created...

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.660
...To demonstrate respect toward another person, right?

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:57.220
And even then...

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:57.720
"Eh?"

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.560
"How is this said in honorific speech?"

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.700
Don't you wind up looking for a lot of words in Google?

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:06.180
"Please let me serve you!! Please let me serve you!!
(AI-chan is using a very uncommon honorific word)"

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:06.720
Good!

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.300
Having said that, I’ve shown you the positive aspects of Japan!

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.800
Eh? I didn't do it?

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:11.300
Then!!

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.480
I don't plan on accepting complaints nor objections!!

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.100
After all, what I really wanted to say to you is...

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.960
That Japan is a nice place so come all, everyone

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.500
