00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Hmm...

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:02.860
uhm...

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:04.940
Is the camera on?

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:06.720
Hmm, can you hear me?

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.040
Nice to meet you,

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.060
my name is Kizuna Ai,

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:11.540
Pleased to meet you!

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:13.640
Did anyone notice what that was earlier on?

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:17.020
Well well, that was A.I. Channel's version of a PC wallpaper!

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:20.580
Actually, that can be easily done!

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.140
YES, with the Wallpaper Engine!

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:25.740
Today, I would like to introduce you to...

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:26.600
*drum rolls*

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.320
Wallpaper Engine!

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.120
Well simply put,

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:33.720
it's an application that allows you to create and use live wallpapers!

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.460
As for the price, it only costs 398yen (3.5usd),

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:37.200
it's cheap!

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.360
You can even download live wallpapers created by other users via the Steam Workshop!

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.960
All you have to do (in the app) is just to select a wallpaper from the list,

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:50.460
it's really easy, isn't it?

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:51.980
And click "OK"

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:53.840
After clicking,

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.240
What do you think?

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.740
Just two clicks: Choose and Set

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:01.800
Just like that, you can have a live wallpaper on your screen!

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.580
Super easy, isn't it?

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.820
And, you can also customize the colors!

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.220
Can you see the wallpaper behind (the window)?

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.120
Now, its color is pinkish like me

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:17.420
Now, as I move the sliders on the color selection panel it turns black and purplish!

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.060
You can even adjust the playback speed!

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.460
You can customize it anyway you want!

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:24.100
How's this?

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:25.740
My personal color,

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:26.800
and speed!

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.300
It's unique, isn't it!

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.000
Furthermore, there's not only the default ones,

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:40.720
at the Steam Workshop you can also download and use live wallpapers created by other users!

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.060
At the wallpaper browsing window,

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.200
click the "Browse Workshop" button on the bottom left,

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.920
and you will be able to view the wallpapers created by other users!

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:51.600
This,

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.080
I'm curious about this one!

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.860
In the wallpaper, your girlfriend (or a girl) appears!

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:58.100
Something like that?

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:02.720
When you click the "Subscribe" button on this page,

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.400
the wallpaper will be added to your list!

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:09.720
What do you think?

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:11.440
She's sleeping!

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.040
Right now in my computer,

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.060
a girl almost as cute as me is...

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.060
I can hear her breathing!

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.360
Ahh~! She spoke!

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.300
She's... speaking to me

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:25.900
She's cuuute!

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:26.920
That's great, isn't it?

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.800
So everyone...

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:30.900
after looking at this,

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.960
don't you feel tempted to get this?

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:34.160
Oh dear look at this,

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:39.480
there is also a live wallpaper of Miku-san!

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.220
Ah, there it is~

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.900
And,

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:43.300
OK!

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.060
Look at this!

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.000
She's hopping!

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:47.500
Sofaaa~

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:48.480
Ahh!~

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.440
Haven't we seen this somewhere before?

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.740
Ohh!~

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.420
L-Look at how flowy her hair is!

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:01.880
This is great, isn't it?

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:03.360
So cuuute!~

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.780
I saw this on twitter and was really curious about it

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:09.380
Ah, look at how flowy her hair is,

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:11.940
does anyone understand what I'm trying to say?

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:16.180
See, her hair falls in place nicely

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:18.320
Then she looks over here and pops out right in front of you-

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:19.220
Ahh!

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:20.200
So close~

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.000
Now, let's get down to business

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.960
You know, you can also use your own video as a live wallpaper!

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:28.320
You have to,

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.080
Open the file from here

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:32.860
And then,

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:37.260
you select the video that you want to use as wallpaper

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:42.200
By the way, the video has to be in .mp4 format if you wanna use it, so do take note!

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.080
How's this?

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:45.860
It is me!

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.360
Myself feat. myself~

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:52.640
With this,

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:59.300
I will be able to see the cute, genius, etc. me all the time!~

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:02.280
Not everyone has a video of me, right?

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.280
Don't worry even if you don't have it!

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:05.840
You see,

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.960
even without downloading the video,

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:12.980
you can also link it via the video's URL!

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:17.320
Click the "Open from URL" button,

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:21.260
insert the video's URL and,

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:24.340
tadaa, it becomes a live wallpaper!

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:25.480
And look,

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:27.660
even though this is a wallpaper,

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.620
you can interact with it!

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.580
It's amazing, isn't it?

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:37.180
With that, everyone can also use A.I. Channel as their wallpaper!

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:39.220
Switch to your desktop and you see Ai-chan,

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:41.380
go on to YouTube and you see Ai-chan again!

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:44.900
You will be with me, all 365 days!

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:48.180
That concludes my introduction to Wallpaper Engine!

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:50.980
I would also like to create a live wallpaper whereby

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:54.780
everyone can also download via Steam Workshop!

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:57.620
With that I'll invade everyone's computer!

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.860
We can meet every day, at anywhere and anytime!

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:05.600
When the live wallpaper's uploaded I'll inform you guys on Twitter, so do stay tuned!

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:10.220
Please use it lots and have fun with me when the time comes!

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:11.380
Well then, see you again,

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:12.480
Bye bye!~
