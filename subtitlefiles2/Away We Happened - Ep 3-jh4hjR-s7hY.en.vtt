00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:06.640
Well, we'll definitely be in touch!

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:09.600
Thank you for coming in, Jean!

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.340
Thank you so much! It was nice to meet you!

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:36.900
Yeah, these look great!

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.840
Yeah. Thanks so much for covering me at that park that day!

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:40.840
Oh yeah, no problem!

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:43.220
Didn't end up being so bad!

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:46.960
All right, here's what you need for L.A.

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:56.980
All right, make sure you get there early, because you have to check in with the manager...

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.620
..who's also a very powerful wizard!

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.060
So, make sure you have a 3-and-a half-leaf clover to protect yourself

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:06.860
from his magical spells.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.580
And I'm also moving to Alaska to become a monk and start my own monastery.

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.360
It was nice knowing you.

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:15.940
Hope we stay friends.

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:17.860
DUDE!

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:19.000
Huh, what?

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.320
You're not even listening to me!

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.440
Oh, uh, sorry. I'm just trying to figure out when to meet Jean to exchange bags.

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:24.260
Oh, really?

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.960
I'm just excited to get my stuff back.

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.160
Come on, man! You like this girl!

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:31.200
She's cool!

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.640
And... I mean, we're just talking.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.060
It's never 'just talking.'

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.900
And if it is- you better step your game up.

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.080
Why are you talking like that?

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.800
Listen, unless you want to be "just friends" with her...

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.040
...you have to make your intentions clear from the beginning.

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.500
Otherwise, you're just shooting yourself in the foot.

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:49.780
Well, I don't want to scare her off either.

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.980
You obviously like her, you just have to let her know, cause...

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:54.840
...who knows how many other guys she might be talking to?

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.400
She's not talking to other guys!

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:57.960
How do you know?

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.840
I could be talking to her right now!

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:01.300
Oh!

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:02.220
There she is!

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:04.820
Hey, Jean!

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.000
Yeah! it's Ben!

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.100
Yeah, dinner sounds great!

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:11.020
I'll pick you up after you hang out with your 'buddy,' Daniel.

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:12.160
Shut up!

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.600
Have you even looked at her profile?

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:16.100
What?

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:17.720
Does she have a lot of pics with other dudes?

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:18.600
I don't know, I haven't checked!

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.580
What?!

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.280
Dude you have a girl's full name and you haven't even looked her up online yet?

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.120
Dude, you got to do your homework these days!

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.120
Call me old school.

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.680
Call you lame!

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.280
Tags, status, pics, get with it!

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:31.680
What's her last name?

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:32.200
No!

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:33.400
Jean No?

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:35.720
Jean No

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:37.460
No, not "no!"

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:38.920
Never mind.

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:40.380
It'll be fine.

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.740
When I see her, I'll be very clear, OK?

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:43.240
How?

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.240
I'll figure it out then.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.980
Yeah, right.

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.380
You've been thinking about this moment for the past 3 days straight.

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.980
Tell me what you're going to say to Jean when you first see her.

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:52.840
Pretend I'm Jean No.

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.080
Impress me.

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:00.760
Hi-

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:06.260
Hey, buddy! OMG, thank you so much for being a pal and taking care of my bag!

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:12.100
I can not wait to platonically hang out with you whenever it's convenient for me!

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:13.440
I'm so glad we're friends!

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:15.320
Oh, no.

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.640
See! You want that to happen?

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.380
You have to make your intentions clear!

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:20.260
OK, all right.

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:21.500
Let me try again.

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.040
Hi Jean. I really, really like you and I think about you constantly.

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:29.240
Creepy!

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:30.140
What do you want from me?

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.080
Oh, we got to get you to the airport now

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:34.540
Wait, what am I supposed to do?

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:35.740
Um, just get her something?

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:37.020
Thoughtful!

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:38.980
And be honest.

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:39.880
Not creepy.

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.000
Alright you are going to be late

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.980
Oh, wait, I need to stop by my apartment first.

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:55.040
(ringtone)

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:07.940
Hey...Jeremy.

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:15.140
Uh, yeah, I just got into town a couple of nights ago.

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.960
Hey, hold on, I just got to grab a couple things.

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:24.180
Hey, this really does look like your bag!

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:25.540
It's the exact same one!

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:27.780
Yeah, except with the panda on the side!

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:28.820
Oh, yeah, that's Edgar.

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:30.660
Ok...?

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:31.720
Sorta cute.

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:34.200
Can I have it? Do you think she'll mind?

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:38.560
Um, yeah. I mean I'm staying with a friend right now so...

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:41.920
Hey, where are those documents you were telling me about?

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:43.160
Right here

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:47.380
Are you trying to make me late?

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:48.340
Sorry.

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:57.900
So you packed that 3-and-a-half-leaf clover yet?

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:01.620
What?

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:03.780
You know, for the wizard!

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:05.580
What wizard?

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:08.220
You know when you go to L.A. there's gonna be a wizard waiting for you.

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:09.120
We've been over this.

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:10.000
Ben, what are you talking about?

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.160
He's going to put a spell on you and you need those clovers to, y'know, protect yourself.
