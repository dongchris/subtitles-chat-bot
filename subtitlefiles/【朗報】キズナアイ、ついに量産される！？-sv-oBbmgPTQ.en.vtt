00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:06.980
AI: ...This "Analysis System" seemed like a lot of fun, so then...!!

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:08.660
AI: ...I was playing a bit with that

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:10.580
AI: What was that supposed to be??

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:11.120
H: Eh!?

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:12.880
H: Even with a Dolls creation function!?

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.060
H: How is that possible?

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.900
H: Something like that...

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.540
H: ...The Round Table would never permit it...

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:17.360

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:18.520

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:20.000
H: Mmm...!

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:20.620
H: Ehem...

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:21.960
H: The Round Table is...

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.500
H: ...A group of 12 Dolls...

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.360
H: ...That started in Lancelot-sama and who are in charge of managing Camelot

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:27.220
H: And at the moment...

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:29.160
H: ...Are in search of the right person to sit in the thirteenth position...

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.060
H: ...Once the winner of the matches has been decided...

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:33.340
AI: Mmm...

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.360
AI: Well, I don't understand it very well, but...!

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.140
AI: Now, the "Round Table"?

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.880

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:40.660
H: That's right

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:42.180
AI: Aaahhh! It sounds fun!

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:42.920
AI: That means...

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:44.880
AI: That it's a kind of selection of members for an idol group!?

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.580
AI: Should I try to enter the Round Table?

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:48.540
H: Eeehh?

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:49.860
AI: Good!! Good!! It's been decided!!

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.040
AI: In addition, it'd be fun to do a video in regards to that

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:53.060
AI: In that case...

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:54.480

H: W-what?

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.780
H: W-what are you saying?

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:00.540
H: This is...

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:01.700
H: ...A declaration of war!?

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.220
AI: By the way...

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.740
AI: Eh? What? What?

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:05.840
AI: Does this mean...?

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.040

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:08.120
