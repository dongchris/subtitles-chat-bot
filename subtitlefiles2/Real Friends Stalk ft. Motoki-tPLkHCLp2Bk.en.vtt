00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:09.440
Oh, Elise got a pug!

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:11.020
She's so cute

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:12.320
The pug??

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:13.940
Sure

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.720
Oh, look at this! She was in New York the same time I was!

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.220
Oh, you were in New York? 
No way

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.560
*sarcastic giggle* You didn't know?

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:27.600
No . . . ?

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:28.980
I uh, posted it on my story

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:31.620
Oh . . .

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.860
You didn't watch it?

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.000
I didn't get a chance to check Instagram

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:40.820
For 24 hours?

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.000
I'm still getting used to the new updates

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:46.940
Oh, hey, look they have a fijrito here, your favorite!

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:48.320
You should totally get that

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:50.300
I had that for lunch yesterday!!!

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:51.700
How did you not see that?

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.220
Oh, how was it?

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.300
Delicious, which you would have known, if you saw my tweet

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:59.000
The chef even gave me a mention . . . (sad tone)

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.800
Do you even follow me, bro?

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:03.420
Of course!

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.680
To be honest, yesterday I was just super busy with...

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:07.640
Your grandma!

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.140
I know! You went to Dim Sum. Thanks for the invite!

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:12.680
How did you know that?

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.680
Because! I check your posts!

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.180
I even double tapped! Which apparently, you didn't notice.

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:18.680
Class act, Matt.

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:19.640
*sigh*

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.240
Hey! Kevin, right?

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.800
Elise? What are you doing here?

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.800
Just fighting off some jet lag

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.440
Oh! Where did you go?

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:29.660
New York!

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.840
No way! I was just there too!

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.420
What? We should've met up

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:35.840
You could've met my puppy

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.400
You have a dog?

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.120
Yeah. She's a pug

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.520
She has a pug!

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.200
I gotta go, but, yeah, let's catch up sometime, ok?

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:43.700
Oh! Tots

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.640
You already knew those things!

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.000
Why can't you tell her?

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Oh! That would be creepy!

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
And its not creepy if I do it?

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.520
No Matt.

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.900
Because we're friends and real friends stalk each other.

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.620
You want me to stalk you?

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:09.020
Do I want to see your gym selfies?

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:12.220
Do I want to notice that you wore that same shirt yesterday?

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.820
Not necessarily, but you cared enough to share that information with me

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.380
And if you care, I care.

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:22.040
I stalk because I care.

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.120
You're right. You're right.

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.960
I'm sorry man.

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.900
It's alright.

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:40.700
Yo! Hey!

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:41.440
Oh, hey

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.440
Sorry i'm late, uh, I have so much to tell you

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.440
There was a traffic jam because there was..

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.240
..a truck spilled backpacks all over the freeway

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:48.340
Yeah, I saw

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.080
Oh, my post?

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.080
Yeah thats funny. Hashtag roadkill?

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.080
Oh, yeah, yeah, thanks.

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:56.580
I finally got to try...

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.920
Eric's Donut Bar! You, uh, checked in, so

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.340
Underwhelming

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:03.600
Forgot I posted that

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:04.640
Yeah.

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.560
Uh.. Oh! Well my sister finally had

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.980
the baby, Samantha, six lbs 7 oz?

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.220
Yeah, I saw. Congrats

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:13.280
Oh!

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:15.280
I already saw the photos.

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.280
Oh, okay

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:23.800
Well, what are you, what do you want to do now?

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.520
I guess we can go home?

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:29.520
Oh! Okay. Yeah.

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.440
You should get that

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:38.020
I had that for lundjlksdj

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.760
Tots!

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.720
You already knew all those things!

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.780
*laughing*

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:52.660
Like those,  those like inflatable

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.380
Hey guys! Hope you enjoyed watching that fun and relatable sketch

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:59.780
Yeah, it was a nice return to the real friend series again.

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.020
Yeah, in case you didn't know uh, its an ongoing series we've done

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.040
I was actually in the first one.

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.020
Oh yeah. Its nice to do a more modern take this time around

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:10.300
Wes, admit it, you want your followers to double tap.

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:11.360
Especially your friends.

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:15.620
Yeah, what can I say? I mean why am even posting it if you're not going to double tap?

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:19.000
Hey, yeah I see its okay Wes, I just don't to let you know every time, okay?

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:23.420
Well honestly, it really is hard these days to not, you know, stalk people online

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:24.940
with all the different types of social media

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.580
Too many

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:28.320
Shoutouts to Motoki and Nika for helping us out in this sketch.

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.440
Its always fun to work with new faces.

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:31.800
And all those expressions.

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:32.440
Yeah.

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:35.120
And also we got a brand new shirt design inspired by this sketch

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:37.840
Yeah, don't be like my character, and let your friends know

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.960
I don't just like you, I like for like you

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:42.400

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:57.220

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:59.220
