00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:06.520
Dude! Yes!

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:07.720
Perfect bro!

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:10.440
Absolutely! I'll definitely bring the kettle cord!

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:13.720
Yeah! Of course! Of course! Can't wait to see you.

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:16.420
I'll talk to your later. Love you Pops

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:19.480
That was your dad?

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:21.480
Yeah! He was just confirming some plans for dinner.

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:23.760
My whole family's in town for the holidays so

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.940
just kind of making it a big deal

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:26.980
That's cool

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.380
It just kind of sounded like you were talking to a friend

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:32.300
My dad is my friend

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.820
He's my best friend

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.860
Isn't your dad your best friend?

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.680
Yeah um...sure

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:43.860
I..I mean we just really don't communicate it that way

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.520
I think Asian people we're not as open and casual

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.140
when we talk about our emotions, like.... you are

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.540
So your parents don't say what they really feel?

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:53.100
No

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.220
They don't say "I love you"?

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.400
HA!.....No.....

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.960
When you told your dad you were visiting home, what did he say?

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.120
But what do you think he REALLY meant?

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.100
See?

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:16.580
That's nice!

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:17.580
Yeah...I guess?

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.340
What about when you were growing up?

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.480
That's really interesting

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.060
Why do you think they don't say what they feel?

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.000
I don't know. Maybe they're just not really use to it?

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.600
Maybe they didn't hear much when they were growing up?

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:50.280
They can hear it now...right?

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:55.200
Zhe Xiang come help me with the groceries

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:56.340
Hey ma

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.600
The grocery store was so busy today!

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.720
But I got everything to make your favourite dishes

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:03.180
Did you eat yet?

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.320
I love you too mom

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:11.500
I love you

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:17.420
Awww!

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:18.880
Hi Mrs Wang

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:20.040
Oh hi Jack-e

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:24.280
His name's Jake ma. The e's silent I've been telling you this since middle school

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:25.680
Sorry Jack

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.620
We're at State College, Pennsylvania on our way to

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:31.860
Heather's place

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:34.240
I'm going to deliver food to Christina

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:35.880
she lives in Martinez

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.220
Alright I'm in the sunset district on San Francisco looking for Lisa

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:41.560
Here in Las Vegas

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:42.500
Jie

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:46.680
- What?
- I love you too

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:50.640
Are you being dared to call us?

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.720
- Jie! I've just been...
- Why are you....

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.960
We were just talking and we just realise we never tell our siblings we love them
