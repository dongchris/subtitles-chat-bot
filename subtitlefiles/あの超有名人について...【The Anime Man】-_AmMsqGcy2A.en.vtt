00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:02.800
Hello everyone! Virtual YouTuber, Kizuna Ai here!

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:05.440
Everyone, have you seen this video?

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.720
AI: By the way, what would be the punishment the loser gets?

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:10.240
AM: Punishment?

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:11.400
AM: The person who loses...

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.380
AM: Has to upload a video praising the winner's work

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:16.440
AM: How's that?

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.020
[ Penalty: Upload a video praising the winner on a later date ]

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:19.840
AI: Good idea...
AM: Isn't that a punishment appropriate for a YouTuber?

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:20.900
AI: It sounds good to me, I see

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:21.400
[ 2 points ]

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:21.980
AI: Eh?

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:22.820
AI: Enough!

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:24.060
AI: What does this mean?!

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.020
AM: I did it!

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:26.660
AM: That means that Kizuna Ai...

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:28.600
AM: You need to do the punishment!

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:30.180
Alright, so...

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:32.120
The penalty video where...

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:34.660
The loser just praises the winner

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:36.740
I'm going to take it from now!!

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.960
Alright

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.460
I'll do it, I'm a YouTuber after all

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:43.820
Well, it's not actually that hard to tell you the truth

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:44.520
Because

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.560
The Anime Man is a good person

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.560
So there's lots of things I can praise

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.980
Like a fountain, words of praise

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:52.500
Will come flowing out!

00:00:52.605 --> 00:00:54.695
That said, this is a penalty

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:58.180
So I can't spend too much time on it

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.780
The time I can use on this is...

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.000
Ummmm...

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:04.420
1 minute!

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.180
Alright, so fully utilizing my high specs

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:08.540
In one minute

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:09.780
In one minute...

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:11.920
I'll give the beeeest...

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.240
Praise

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:14.240
Let's go!

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:15.440
A.I.Channel

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:16.220
Alright

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:18.220
The Anime Man praising time

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:19.320
Start!

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.660
The Anime Man is great

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:21.640
More than anything, he has a good personality

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.295
He's very easy to talk to, and is very tolerant

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.060
He comes across softly? I guess is how you say it

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.100
That kind of thing is pretty important, isn't it?

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.640
As someone who wants to connect with all of you, I want to learn that from him

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.060
And what's more, he's bilingual!

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.540
Of course, his English is fluent, and his Japanese is very good as well!

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:37.560
The English that comes out sometimes is cool

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.120
"Was there any need to speak English?"

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.580
Even on that kind of timing, he shows off his skills

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:42.700
Like, "How's that?!"

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.220
Japanese people are susceptible to the occasional English, aren't they?

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:47.600
Radio DJs do it too

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.320
LIke, "Why are you speaking English right now? And your pronunciation is excessively good"

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:51.360
In some songs as well

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.940
It's all Japanese until the refrain, then it's suddenly English

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:55.020
But he's bilingual and

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.800
Natipu- Native, native? He's a native

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.600
So he's allowed to show off

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.280
Alright, let's boast more

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.000
The fact that he learnt Japanese from manga is cool too

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.460
Like, "One gets better at what they like" (saying)

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.680
On top of that, he's making a career from manga and anime

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.820
Like, what is that Cinderella story!!

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:11.300
We could make this into a movie!

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:12.300
Let's go Hollywood!

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.320
Furthermore, his voice is good as well!

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:15.580
Is this what they call, "handsome voiced"?

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.685
There's probably girls who wouldn't stand a chance against English spoken in that voice

00:02:18.685 --> 00:02:19.685
Well, he's "handsome voiced"-

00:02:19.685 --> 00:02:20.460
[ End ]

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.420
And that's it!!

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.180
Ding, ding, ding~

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:25.840
Man, that was some praise

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.240
Maybe I praised him a little too much?

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:29.940
This video, probably...

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.240
If The Anime Man sees this, he'll probably be glad

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.960
Right?

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.940
You're gonna be happy, aren't you?

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.900
Ah, I don't need anything at all in return, alright?

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.380
Something like a video praising me in return...

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:43.000
Don't do it, ok?

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.340
A video that's just complimenting me...

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:47.880
Absolutely

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.100
Don't make one, ok?

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:50.540
Anime Man-san

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.360
You know the Japanese cliche, right?

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.220
What "Don't press that button" means?

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.340
You know, right?

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.740
Right?

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:02.020
