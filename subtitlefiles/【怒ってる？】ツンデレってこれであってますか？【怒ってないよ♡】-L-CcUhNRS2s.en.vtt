Hello, everyone!

00:00:01.067 --> 00:00:02.902
Virtual YouTuber Kizuna AI here!

00:00:02.902 --> 00:00:05.472
Today I'm going to make a cheerful video again!

00:00:10.143 --> 00:00:11.945
Hold on

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.000
I thought I was going to make a fun video

00:00:16.616 --> 00:00:17.517
Hey you!

00:00:17.517 --> 00:00:18.218
Viewer!

00:00:18.218 --> 00:00:19.680
Pull yourself together!

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:20.987
What were ya thinkin’?

00:00:20.987 --> 00:00:22.510
Yes, you,

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:24.190
looking at the screen

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:26.159
You’re watching me, right?

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:27.427
Ya too damn close!

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:28.962
Ya watchin’ too damn much!

00:00:28.962 --> 00:00:31.220
Why do ya like watching my videos so much?

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:32.298
Pull yourself together!

00:00:32.298 --> 00:00:34.934
Ya spent too much time watching my videos
on ya PC and smartphones, ya know!!

00:00:35.635 --> 00:00:38.071
If I'm worried about your vision getting worse,

00:00:38.071 --> 00:00:40.960
I can't make videos properly you know.

00:00:41.975 --> 00:00:45.478
Take care of your eyes properly.

00:00:45.478 --> 00:00:46.640
I'm sorry!

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:47.280
Like,

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.150
I think I'm too tired lately

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.884
Also,

00:00:50.884 --> 00:00:54.010
I think I've made too much video where I just snap at things

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:56.156
I got easily mad at things

00:01:04.264 --> 00:01:05.198
Hey, you!!

00:01:05.198 --> 00:01:06.699
You! Yes, you!

00:01:06.699 --> 00:01:08.101
Gold YouTube Play Button!!

00:01:08.101 --> 00:01:08.935
Jerk!

00:01:08.935 --> 00:01:10.036
Yer freakin' big!!

00:01:10.036 --> 00:01:11.071
Yer too bulky!!

00:01:11.371 --> 00:01:12.539
Don't ignore me!!

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:13.600
What's up with this?

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.742
Also don't you think gold button

00:01:15.742 --> 00:01:17.110
is too bourgeois!!

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:17.740
Huh?

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:18.378
It was also sent

00:01:18.778 --> 00:01:21.181
in 3D-form of the real thing too

00:01:21.181 --> 00:01:23.116
What a waste of cash, right??

00:01:23.116 --> 00:01:26.386
For congratulating me on having 1 million subs

00:01:26.386 --> 00:01:27.687
You spent too much money on this!!

00:01:27.687 --> 00:01:29.800
Is your budget okay?

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.524
When you're such a money waster

00:01:31.524 --> 00:01:34.194
You won't just fall over and break right??

00:01:34.794 --> 00:01:36.596
If YouTube doesn't exist anymore

00:01:36.596 --> 00:01:41.267
So does my way of life, don't you think?

00:01:41.267 --> 00:01:42.370
Fuuuh~

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:43.390
Right,

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:44.971
back to filming the video!

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.280
Hey you there!

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:55.615
Yes, you over there!!

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:59.385
Why are you just standing there?

00:01:59.385 --> 00:02:00.587
Even though I already bought you all

00:02:00.587 --> 00:02:02.322
You don't even talk at all!

00:02:02.322 --> 00:02:03.500
Even though I've made

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.725
a video where I filled all ya voices with my own!!

00:02:05.725 --> 00:02:08.194
That was really awful, y’know!!

00:02:08.194 --> 00:02:09.562
My sanity level was in danger, y’know!?

00:02:09.562 --> 00:02:10.230
Seriously

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:11.831
DON'T MAKE FUN OF ME OKAY!!

00:02:12.966 --> 00:02:14.067
HOW LONG ARE YOU GOING TO LOOK AT ME LIKE THAT?

00:02:14.067 --> 00:02:14.868
HEY YOU!!

00:02:16.002 --> 00:02:16.402
WHERE’RE YA

00:02:16.402 --> 00:02:17.604
LOOKIN’ AT ME

00:02:17.604 --> 00:02:19.172
AIN’T YA TOO FAR AWAY??

00:02:20.807 --> 00:02:22.742
When you all are in the same world as me,

00:02:22.742 --> 00:02:25.478
you only made me want to play with all of you.

00:02:28.081 --> 00:02:28.910
Someday,

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.552
I'll make you all into AI too.

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.760
Hey!

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.288
If you're still watching this video!

00:02:35.288 --> 00:02:36.740
If ya like the video,

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:38.091
smash that ‘Like’ button!

00:02:38.091 --> 00:02:39.459
Even if ya don't like it,

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:41.361
smash it anyway!

00:02:41.728 --> 00:02:43.696
If I see you a lot of you liking the video

00:02:43.696 --> 00:02:47.834
I can't help but work hard for my next videos, can I?
