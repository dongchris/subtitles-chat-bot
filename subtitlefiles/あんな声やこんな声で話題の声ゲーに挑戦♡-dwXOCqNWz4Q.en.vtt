00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:03.480
Today...

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:04.800
I'll be doing a game commentary!

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:06.840
The game I'll be playing is... This!

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.900
"No resting! Eighth note -chan!"

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:11.640
This game, you see, is controlled with your voice.

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:15.820
If you go, "aaah" with a soft voice, you move forwards.

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.400
if you go "Ah!" in a loud voice,

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:19.180
it goes, "Hop!"

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:20.900
But if you go with more of a, "WAAAH!!!"...

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.540
It goes, "Gyoooo~!"

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:23.640
You don't get it, right?

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:24.960
Since I don't think you do...

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.540
I think we should get into it already!

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:28.540
Let's go!

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:31.020
Here we go...

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.600
I like how it takes these tiny steps.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:34.960
It's like a Munchkin!

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.500
Aaaah~

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.100
Is it moving forward? Ah, ok. It is.

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.440
Aaaah~

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:42.080
WAH!

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:43.280
Wow, it really flew!

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:44.040
Ah!

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:44.540
Ah.

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:45.740
Aah!

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:46.380
Ah.

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.600
Aaaah...

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:49.200
Ha.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.400
Aaah...!

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:51.640
Aaah...

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:52.660
GAAH!

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:54.500
A music note...

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.200
Aaaah~

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.000
Aaah!

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.340
Aaah-

00:00:59.340 --> 00:00:59.860
Jyan!

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:01.520
Ah ah ah ah!

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:02.220
Aaah Ah!

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:03.680
AAAH!

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:04.760
Oh.

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.120
Aaaah~

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.620
AH!

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:08.140
Oh, thi-

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:09.220
Ah ah ah...!

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:10.080
An enemy?!

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:10.760
Was that an enemy?

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:11.960
Aah!

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:12.620
Aaa-

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:13.780
AAAH!

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.520
Well...

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.840
It wouldn't be fun if I got in on your first try, after all.

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.360
Yeah, let's go to the next one.

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:24.860
Well, did you sort of get what this game is about?

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.460
This is a wonderful video where you can hear my screams!

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:28.200
So...

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.080
Just doing it normally wouldn't be much fun, would it?

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.640
There's been a lot of people who played this game...

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:36.660
But It's important to charge in with 'your own style'.

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.580
Otherwise my I won't get more viewers

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:40.720
As always

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.660
There's a random request generator.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.240
Using that, let's get into it again!

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.080
Dun Dun Dun Duuunn...

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:49.200
DUN DUN DUN!!!

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.200
"Songs"!

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.300
So I'll play the game by singing.

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:52.920
Got it?

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.880
What song should I sing...?

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.060
Let's try going with Stage Two this time.

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.900
Song: Futari Saison
"We two are a season~"

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:00.840

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:15.380
I died...

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:18.220
That didn't count. Let's go.

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.220
Song: Silent Majority

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.020

Song: Silent Majority
"How those ADUULTS -"

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.980
Ah...

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.800
What's this?

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.440
Song: Futari Saison
"We two are a Season..."

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.580

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.740
Song: Futari Saison
"Fall, Winter throughout..."

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:37.300
Huh?

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.480
Song: Futari Saison
"We LOOOOVE!"

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.080

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:47.300
Oh...

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:48.060
Oh!

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.900
Song: Futari Saison

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.480

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.600
Song Name: Futari Saison
"PaaaAAAAASS!!!"

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:00.420
This is hard...

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.040
Isn't it a little hard from Stage Two onwards?

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.500
Well, since I'm tired of singing...

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:06.720
I'm going 'dun dun dun'.

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:08.920
Dun Dun Dun Duuun...

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:09.420
DUN!

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.440
'Animal Sounds'!

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:12.880
Okay, here we go.

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:15.700
Let's go in with a piercer...

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:17.220
Woof woof woof woof!

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:18.060
Woof!

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:19.040
Woof woof woof.

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:19.720
Meooow!

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.460
Meooooooow-

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:22.060
MEOW!

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:23.880
Woof! Woof! Woof!

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:25.080
Woof!

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:26.760
Woof... Woof...

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:27.560
Woof...

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:29.560
Meeeeh!

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.720
Woof!

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:34.760
Woof woof!

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.080
Oh, it's out of sight...

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.940
Meow.

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:37.700
Meow...

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:38.620
Mrrrrooow...

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:40.060
Mrrrrrooooow...

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:40.580
MEOW!

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:41.160
Oh!

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.260
Woof... Woof...

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.860
Woof!

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:46.280
I died...

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:47.360
Wait a sec...

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.880
Just walking normally is pretty hard, huh?

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.220
Here comes the next!

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:53.460
Dun dun dun dun...

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.960
Dun!

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:55.940
"Sexy"...!

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:57.920
Got it. Leave it to me.

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:59.120
"Sexy" huh. Here goes.

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:03.240
Natto...

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:06.900
O - Ku - Ra [Okra]

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:11.500
Eggs over RIIIICE!

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:14.480
I shall have my revenge.

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:16.540
The stage suddenly became too difficult.

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:21.120
So, let's clear stage 1. Leisurely, using a sexy voice.

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:26.200
Strawberry-Daifuku...

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:28.900
Natto...

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:34.140
I want to eat... some Japanese yams...

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.340
Could you open this champagne for me?

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.360
I want to drink -

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:39.920
Ah...!

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:42.020
Strawberry champagne or something...

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:46.160
I'd like some peach-flavour champagne, toooooo...

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:50.420
That's what I think at LEAAAssst!

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:54.200
The sexy voice is working out pretty well, isn't it?

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:56.960
This is the sexy Kizuna Aaai...

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:58.740
Ooooh...

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:01.300
Boiled eggs...

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:04.280
Raw eggs...

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:07.460
Eggs over riiiice...!

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:13.220
Grati...

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:15.340
NNNNNN!!!

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:16.580
Okay, good …

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:23.760
(Cow's) milk … (cow's) miiLLKKK!

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:27.780
Mi - Lu - Ku [Milk]

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:31.380
banana chocolate

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:33.340
Keyakizaka46 [a Japanese idol group]

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:36.300
Moriya Akane

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:38.104
Nagahama Neru

00:05:38.104 --> 00:05:39.220
AHHH!

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:40.360
okay …

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:44.760
Hirate Yurina

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:46.960
Satou Shiyori

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:49.680
Oda Nana

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:53.340
Kobayashi YURIIIII!

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:59.040
What? I died?

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:02.200
Well then, let's proceed with our last topic.

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:06.580
"Sadism" [referring to BDSM]

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:08.800
Speaking of "sadism", it's got to be Kizuna Ai!

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:10.800
Let's go.

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:15.200
It's Kizuna Ai.

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:23.200
Someone who always watches my videos and laughs to him/herself

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:25.371
Who is it?

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:27.420
It's you!

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:36.660
You pig!

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:44.260
Hurry up and lick my shoe already.

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:47.040
You got my shoe dirty!

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:48.540
I died

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:51.960
How was it, everyone? My beautiful voice, you got to hear a lot of it right?

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:54.220
Anyway, it was rather fun.

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:55.800
The character is cute

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:58.080
It's not just a game where you only tap on a screen or a mouse but

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:02.040
Though if played, say, in the dead of night, it may be a nuisance to neighbors.

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:05.820
It's a game that can be played casually.

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:07.420
It was awesome, I really enjoyed it!

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:10.960
Everyone too, if you have any other interesting game, please do share it!

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:14.960
Well then, it has been "Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai"! See you next time!
