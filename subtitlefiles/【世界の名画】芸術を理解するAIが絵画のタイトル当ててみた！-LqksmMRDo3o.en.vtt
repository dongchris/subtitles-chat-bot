00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:02.860
Hello, everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna AI here!

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:05.010
Lately, AIs have drawn illustrations

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:06.190
and written short novels

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:08.750
We’ve also branched out into the field of arts!

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:09.650
Therefore,

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:11.390
as an AI,

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.310
I will also unveil

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:14.880
these hidden abilities!!

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:16.240
For today,

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:17.970
with various masterpieces,

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.240
I will try to...

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:20.610
guess their titles!

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:22.320
I’ll show my amazing sense for titles

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:23.210
Alright, let’s go!

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:25.300
Ta-daaaa!

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.630
This title…

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:30.120
involves milk, right?

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:31.250
“Milk

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:32.610
Being Poured by a

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.280
Woman”

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:36.720
“The Milkmaid”
[Johannes Vermeer - The Milkmaid]

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.420
I mean,

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:39.040
I guess I worded it weirdly

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:40.490
Ehh?

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:41.530
So this…

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:43.000
lady is…

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.690
like,

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:44.880
“We beat ‘em!!”

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:45.480
I think

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:46.250
“We beat ‘em!!”?

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.720
Maybe “Let’s go!!”

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:49.090
Wait, the man behind her

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:50.680
has a surprised look on his face

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:51.680
“Whoa, what are you?”

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:52.180
sort of...

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:52.920
haha

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:54.450
So,

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:55.560
“Hey, you guys!!”

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:56.860
“Let’s go!!”

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:58.560
Though she’s the leader

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:00.130
“Um, Miss…

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:01.700
Your Bust is Showing”

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.720
That kind of title

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:05.770
I was way off!
[Eugène Delacroix - Liberty Leading the People]

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:07.280
“Liberty
[Eugène Delacroix - Liberty Leading the People]

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.720
Leading the People”
[Eugène Delacroix - Liberty Leading the People]

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:11.720
This lady’s nude too?

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:13.180
She’s totally naked

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.000
But she can't compare with me

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:16.360
Those tigers are thinking,

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:17.860
“There’s a naked chick!”

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.950
Like that, right?

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.700
But,

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:21.770
People have been...

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:24.480
...involving deeper with the nature?

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:26.430
And the animals are naked

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:27.350
So,

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:28.500
“Living With Nature”

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:29.250
Like this

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.850
“The Dream”
[Henri Rousseau - The Dream]

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:32.700
As in, this world is like a dream?
[Henri Rousseau - The Dream]

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:34.890
Er, this…

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.850
is a fish, right?

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.420
Because it’s just the one fish,

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.510
compared to the others,

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:41.370
it’s different

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.210
It’s eyes are spinning

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:44.770
“A Feeling of Alienation,

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:46.410
and Perceptive to it,

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:47.330
Fish”

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:49.040
“The Goldfish”
[Paul Klee - The Goldfish]

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:49.990
Simple as that!!
[Paul Klee - The Goldfish]

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.710
This…

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.560
has ordinary sand, sea,

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:55.660
and sky, right?

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.860
And it’s kind of blurred so...

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:58.540
Wait

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.310
It’s a bit romantic~

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:01.420
It’s kinda romantic, huh? haha

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:02.350
Err

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.090
“The Boundary of Dreams and Reality”

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.630
Lame! Haha

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:07.140
SO LAME!!

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:09.500
“Colours Beginning”
[William Turner - Colours Beginning]

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:10.770
I-I-I guess?
[William Turner - Colours Beginning]

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:13.150
For this...

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.290
Before was “Colours Beginning”

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.930
so, this...

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:17.620
The woman...

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:18.560
Right?

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:19.130
Er,

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:20.840
so, she’s quite naked

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:22.070
and she’s like,

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:23.630
wrapped up

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.820
This is like...

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:27.140
It's like inside a mother’s womb

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:28.840
“Life Beginning”

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:32.570
“The Heart of the Rose”?
[Elihu Vedder - The Heart of the Rose]

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:33.290
Get the hell out!
[Elihu Vedder - The Heart of the Rose]

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:35.080
Huh? What the heck?

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.010
Hmm…

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.900
This,

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:38.060
But, like,

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.120
The image on the left looks like a face

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:41.190
with a nose

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:42.730
and winking

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.000
...and there’s a hat above

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.170
Ahh...

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:46.790
For this,

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:48.720
I wonder

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:49.620
Er…

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:51.430
This…

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:52.750
Er…

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.850
“Building Blocks”

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:56.440
“Accent on Rose”
[Wassily Kandinsky - Accent on Rose]

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:57.510
What’re you saying?
[Wassily Kandinsky - Accent on Rose]

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:59.170
So this is...

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:01.470
“Nightmares Beginning”

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.060
“Several Circles”
[Wassily Kandinsky - Several Circles]

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:04.970
For sure
[Wassily Kandinsky - Several Circles]

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:07.350
OK!

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.180
So, like that…

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:10.730
regarding art...

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:12.200
I have no clue!

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:13.080
The titles are...

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.100
...well, related to each artist’s sense so...

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.170
…I couldn’t grasp that very well

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:18.860
In that case, I’ll leave....

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.590
...the arts field to the rest of the A.I.

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:22.190
And I think...

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:23.600
I'll continue...

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:26.850
...being a creative entertainer!!

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.360
This was Virtual YouTuber Kizuna AI!

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:30.360
