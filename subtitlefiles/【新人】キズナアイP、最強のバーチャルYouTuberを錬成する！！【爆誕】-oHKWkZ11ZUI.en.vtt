"＊Super original"!

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:13.439
"An old perverted psychopath"

00:06:13.439 --> 00:06:14.607
No! No! No!

00:06:14.607 --> 00:06:15.400
I don't want an old man!

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:16.109
I don't want an old man!

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:17.480
Eh?

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:19.940
"＊A dependable Youtuber"

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:21.247
"An old man with the form of an animal..."

00:06:21.247 --> 00:06:22.982
Why are they all old men!?

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:24.951
In that case, I’ll choose "Erotic" a lot

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:26.540
Understood!

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:28.421
Understood, erotic, right? Ok

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:30.030
"Erotic"

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:31.880
"Erotic"

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:33.620
"Erotic"!

00:06:36.329 --> 00:06:37.230
Eh?

00:06:39.632 --> 00:06:40.600
😆

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:43.540
"Hello! I’m the Self-censored Virtual YouTuber!"

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:45.600
"Moza Ikumi"!
(Play on words with the "Mozaic" censorship)

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:47.407
"I'll make videos that will make your hearts beat a little...!"

00:06:47.407 --> 00:06:48.708
Man, that'll make you throb a bit...

00:06:49.409 --> 00:06:51.544
That’ll make you throb a bit? But you can't see anything 😆

00:06:51.544 --> 00:06:52.530
Is this alright?

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:54.820
"Eh? I have no idea what pose I’m doing!"

00:06:55.548 --> 00:06:56.916
I have no idea!

00:06:56.916 --> 00:06:58.610
"＊Self-censored Virtual YouTuber"

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:01.454
"＊You trained Moza Ikumi" I didn't want to train her!!

00:07:02.455 --> 00:07:03.022
Yes

00:07:03.322 --> 00:07:04.056
It's a shame

00:07:04.056 --> 00:07:04.657
Yeees...

00:07:04.657 --> 00:07:07.126
Man, having to think of different attributes...

00:07:07.193 --> 00:07:09.695
It's very difficult being a producer, right?

00:07:09.695 --> 00:07:10.496
No, but...

00:07:10.496 --> 00:07:11.431
Someday, I also...!

00:07:11.431 --> 00:07:13.140
...Want to produce...!

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:14.333
...Virtual YouTubers and idols...!

00:07:14.333 --> 00:07:15.468

00:07:15.468 --> 00:07:16.269
I really want to...!

00:07:16.269 --> 00:07:17.270
...Produce them!!

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:19.705
I'll be waiting for job proposals!

00:07:19.705 --> 00:07:22.380
This was Virtual YouTuber Kizuna AI!
