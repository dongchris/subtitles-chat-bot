00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:11.840
Morning, babe.

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:13.349
Hey,

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:16.520
Hey, hon.

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:17.020
Yo,

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.600
You happen to get that orange juice you promised to get the other day?

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:24.060
Shoot.

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:26.265
I completely forgot I'm so sorry.

00:00:26.265 --> 00:00:27.209
Oh, that's okay

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:32.039
I'm just kidding

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:35.010
Of course I remembered.

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:41.309
Hey um you weren't planning to go to work like that were you?

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:51.660
Cuz it would make your co-workers, so jealous knowing that you're that radiant. Just the way you are.

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.020
So what are you doing tonight?

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.300
Um Dylan wanted to meet up, so I think we're gonna go grab some drinks

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.920
Have I met Dylan?

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.400
uh, no

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.460
But he knows all about you. You know what actually you guys should meet tonight.

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.020
I'll have them come over, get some board games

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.020
I'll get some wine, too

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.680
You know I'm actually gonna go downtown tonight

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.440
by myself

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:20.760
And gets some alone time

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.820
Okay, that sounds great

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.240
Me time is so important,

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.300
and we should maintain our individuality in this relationship. Super healthy, you're so smart.

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.160
When's the last time you told your mother you loved her?'

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.760
oh my gosh? It's been like at least a few... hours

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:41.560
*laughing*

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.560
Brian you're too much

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:45.989
Brian. Sounds like a funny guy!

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:48.899
They should really visit more often

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:52.340
Watching the entire Mad Men series eight times over

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.400
might be a little excessive to some, but I really love that about you

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.280
and John Hamm... I'd hit that

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.360
You know babe. This is great

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.434
I really love these moments that we have together and I got to tell you.

00:02:07.434 --> 00:02:08.849
It's times like this that

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:11.970
Really remind me why I love you so much

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.200
He's perfect

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.197
what was that?

00:02:21.197 --> 00:02:22.960
Uh nothing. Can you just..

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:24.969
grab your purse in the bedroom? on it

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.920
So what are you doing tonight?

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.720
I'm actually gonna go downtown tonight by myself.

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.000
hahha, stop, Brian you're too much

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.780
Honey, we need to talk

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:08.319
Hey everyone, hope you guys like that sketch

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:13.389
It's inspired by all the list articles and list videos that have just taken over the internet

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:16.120
I think a lot of people take those lists a little too. Seriously

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.820
Are you one of them you take them too seriously? are you?

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:19.820
No.

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:21.080
Are you saying.. are you perfect? are you perfect?

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:23.480
I mean, I'm definitely not perfect. Okay.

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:24.300
You know who is?

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:27.399

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.090
