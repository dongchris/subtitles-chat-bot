00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.380
Hey everyone! Welcome to another episode of Comments in Cars!/the Car!

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:05.840
No, there's no "the."

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:08.320
Hey everyone, Alisa Allapach is our special guest today.

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:11.100
She's in our YouTube Red series, Single By 30.

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:13.460
And one of her episodes actually just came out this past week.

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:15.040
So we thought it was only appropriate

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:16.780
to read comments from another project she did with us,

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:17.540
Untouchable.

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:18.560
Thanks for being here, first of all.

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:19.280
Of course.

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:23.580
BIJAH L says, "Blue Moon is a twist off. No opener needed, yo."

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.720
There were a lot of people that called me out on that.

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.080
You're right. I can't believe they saw that.

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.080
Our fans are very, very smart.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.320
Or they're alcoholics.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.840
Cudencuden?

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.760
"Dang, so no dinner next week, dot dot dot."

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:38.320
 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:39.560
What? Oh, haha.

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:41.620
Wanna grab dinner sometime next week?

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:44.800
See, I guess that's a hard "No."

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.420
As hard as it gets.

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:48.420
Yeah, that's true. I was like, wait, where does that come--

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.420
Oh, it's 'cause, yeah, I was asking you to have dinner.

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.420
And you had a very, very long rejection.

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.420
Don't do it, it's a trap.

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.920
You could've just said no.

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.120
You could've just said no.

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.700
There was a lot of comments that were like,

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.160
"Why is she lecturing him?" -"Yeah."

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.700
And, and uh, "She's being so hard." -"Yeah."

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.600
The thing is, I made you say that stuff. So-it's not her.

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:05.100
I mean,

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.520
Evan needed to hear it.

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.380
Evan needed to be beaten down a little bit.

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:13.940
Bryan says, "Dang it Wong Fu, I don't even have any romantic experience to compare this to, but I still feel it."

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:15.380
Whoa. -Awww!

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.260
It's like VR. Wong Fu is basically relationship VR.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.260
We give you that feeling even if you don't actually know it.

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.380
Azncarlpk? AZN.

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.080
AZN.

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:26.880
That's old school.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.560
You know shit's about to go down when Wong Fu starts swearing.

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.680
You know we're so hardcore!

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:32.760
Sooo hardcore.

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.560
'Cause we had 3 swear words.

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.080
There weren't even that many, I feel like.

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:37.600
But a lot of people were actually really surprised.

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:39.620
But we've had videos in the past, actually, that-

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:40.600
Where you do swear?

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.440
That we-yeah. There was one called, To Those Nights.

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:44.780
And...umm...

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.640
I guess hearing Wong Fu swear is different?

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.480
Well, you know, it's a part of...the emotion of...the piece.

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.300
Trin Lovell?

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:55.680
"The most frustrating part of this

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.940
Was her jacket that wasn't fully put on."

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.700
You're such a tease.

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.700
Is this girl like a fashionista or something? Like-

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.700
She's very pretty in her, uh, picture.

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.700
And for that night that was so cold

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.700
I wouldn't have brought a denim jacket.

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.700
I would've brought like, a down jacket.

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.940
In your defence, I think what happened for Wendy, your character,

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.940
She thought she was on her way out, right?

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:17.740
That is true.

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:20.020
And then she's like, "Oh wait, I have to get into this long conversation."

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.620
You weren't ready to put that all on.

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.620
And I think it would've been awkward if I was like,

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.260
Hold your thought, Evan. -Exactly.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:27.740
Let me put my purse down.

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:28.700
Tina Wang says,

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:30.620
"Give that girl an Oscar."

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:31.400
Aww.

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:32.280
Hell yeah!

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.140
Very good acting.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.540
Alisa's amazing. (Too kind.) We first started working with her on Single By 30.

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.280
She's in an episode of Single By 30,

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.280
And we were like, "Man, we gotta keep working with her, outside of Single By 30!"

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.280
She's crying, all the time!

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.280
Whenever we need a crying girl,

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.280
We can call her up.

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.280
I appreciate those words.

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.940
Reuben Ravelo says, "This video has really touched me. Oh...wait...?"

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:55.240
Ohh!

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:59.360
Ha! Ha, 'cause it's called Untouchable.

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.360
Points to you.

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.360
Cindy Le

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.360
