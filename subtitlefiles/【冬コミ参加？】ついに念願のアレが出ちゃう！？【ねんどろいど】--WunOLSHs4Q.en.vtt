Very good

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:05.100
I’ll look for myself on the internet

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:06.200
Hmm...?

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.900
Is someone talking about me?

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.480
Is it over here?

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.540

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:16.280
Hmm...?

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:18.560
In Tokyo...

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:20.460
...Akihabara?

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.240

Aki: Hmm...

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:35.960
Aki: It’d be good if it was of someone currently popular, right?

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.360
K: If we’re talking about someone popular...

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.400
K: For example, well... Instead of an anime character...

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.260

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:43.980

K: That's right
Aki: Right?

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:50.540
Aki: I wonder if the kids will like it

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:54.140
K: It is possible that the kids will like it and that other people will also...

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:55.240
Aki: The rest of the people as well... I see...

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:57.480

Aki: Who could it be? Hikakin?

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:16.060

Aki: Hikakin?

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.080

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.580
AI: I'm like a wife who hounds her husband, right?

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.140
AI: Aki-san...

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:18.240

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.700
AI: Well, having felt being called, I came here and I find myself in front of a director...

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:45.440
AI: ...Really, well...

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.020

Aki: Yes

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.660

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:19.360
Aki: So then?

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.740

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:53.000

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.620
K: Colon-san?

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:58.660

AI: ...That way, I'm still alive after starting publishing such difficult content...

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:00.720
AI: I’m trending...

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:05.540
AI: I'm doing it with a lot of energy but I'll continue doing it this way, I'm not going to step on the brake

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:07.160
AI: Also!

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:16.000
Aki: Right?

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.820

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:32.100

AI: And also, well... although you said you like to create something of mine...
K: Yes
Aki: Mmm...

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.440
AI: ...The visual is very important to make a figure

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:41.100
K: Yes
Aki: It’s true, the visual look...
AI: I...

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:43.240

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:48.980

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:51.440

Aki: I see
K: Ooohhh…

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:55.620
AI: And also, still...
Aki: After all, the figures don't talk, right?

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:56.580
K: It’s true
A: Still...

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:58.280
AI: ...I don’t have a figure!
*Reason 4: I still don’t have a figure*

00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:59.640
K: Ah
Aki: Oh
AI: It’d be the first time!

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:00.820
K: I see
AI: Definitely...

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:04.940
AI: ...Everything has a certain special value  when it's done for the first time

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:06.740
K: It’s true
Aki: Even though there still exists a risk, right?

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:08.020
AI: Ah, mmm... but...!

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:09.420
AI: Well... you know... eh...

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:13.760
AI: With the power of the Good Smile company, we could do something...

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:15.300
AI: I think we can do it

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:19.020
AI: It’s because of that, that there's still time!

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:19.900
AI: It’d be my first time!
K: Still on time

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:23.400
AI: We could be the first in making it with Kizuna AI, What do you think?

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:26.680
Aki: It sounds fantastic, right?
K: It sounds great, right?

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:28.020
Aki: Right? Yes
K: It was a great discussion

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:30.080
Aki: It’s possible it’d make my son very excited

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:35.220
AI: W-w-what do you think? Will you do a figure of me?

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:36.240
AI: What do you think?

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:37.480
Aki: Should we do it?

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:38.420
K: Should we do it?

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:39.180
Aki: It’s somewhat hasty?
AI: Eh?

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:40.160
AI: Recently... Eh?

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:41.440
AI: You said... Eh?

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:44.540
AI: Did you say: "Let's do it"?

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:46.000
K: Yes
Aki: We’ll do it?

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:47.280

AI: Eh? Rea...?

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:51.540
AI: R-r-r-really, are you certain?

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:53.080
Aki: Do you think it won't work?

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:54.180

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:55.740
AI: No! Ah! No!

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:57.940

AI: No, well, of course, but...

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:05.000
AI: Well, here
K: It’s incredible, you really seem agitated

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.660
AI: If it was rejected here by the director...

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:09.700
AI: ...I’ll do a challenge with Kahotan-san
K: Yes

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:10.660
AI: And if I win...!
K: Oh!

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:15.780
AI: ...Well, I could go propose toward my Nendoroid or my figure

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.880
AI: That was a calculation I made as a Super A.I, but...
Aki: Ah, you see those kinds of things on YouTube
K: It’s true

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:21.000
Aki: Calculating...

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:25.220
AI: Eh? Are you really on board on this?

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:26.620
Aki: Man, you seem rather insecure, right?

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:27.140
K: It’s true

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:30.320
AI: NO! NO! NOT AT ALL! I’m not at all insecure!

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:33.620
AI: Up to now, everyone calls me a piece of junk, so then...

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:36.020
AI: Generally I tend to fail in what I do...

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:40.500
AI: ...So seeing everything progressing so well, well, suddenly I feel rather unsure

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.220
Aki: In that case, well...

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:45.740
Aki: Well... if you're unsure...
K: Yes

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:47.620
Aki: Well, before making your figure...
AI: Yes

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:49.800
Aki: In the Winter Comiket... right?

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:51.840
Aki: We’ll be launching your products in the Winter Comiket

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:53.600
K: Ah, sounds good
Aki: What do you think? Should we attempt it?

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:54.460
AI: Eh?

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:58.315
AI: The Winter Comiket… you’re referring to Comiket, right?

00:06:58.315 --> 00:06:59.745
Aki: That's right, "Comic Market"

00:07:00.535 --> 00:07:01.540
Aki: You like it, right?

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:03.440
AI: I wanted to appear there!

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:05.000
AI: Well, please, please!
Aki: Ooohh...
K: Ooohh...

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:07.280
AI: Can I have your help?

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:10.520
AI: Please bring me to Makuhari!
Aki: Very good, very good
(Makuhari = Event Hall)

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:11.320
Aki: That was long time ago

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:12.560
Aki: Now it’s in Ariake
(Tokyo region)

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:13.680
AI: Ah! Ah! Ah! It's true!

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:15.260
AI: I learned it in the previous video

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:15.860
AI: Ah...

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:18.400
AI: Please bring me... bring me to Ariake!

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:19.260
AI: Eh? Really? Eh?

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:20.300
AI: Y-you sure?

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:21.520
Aki: What do you think?

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:22.500
K: It”ll be fine!

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:24.060
Aki: Ah, will it be fine? Surely?

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:25.480
K: No, if you ask me why I think that, well...

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:29.580
K: Well, I thought that I’d like to make products of Ai-chan, so then...

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:31.300
Aki: Ah, with the planning team?
K: That's right

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:33.500
K: I’ll make the documents with the planning team

00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:36.880
AI: EH? This is the right moment!
K: C-can I show them?

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:39.800
Aki: It's true, it's the right moment, I didn't think we would meet with you
K: That's right, it's the right moment

00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:41.100
K: Here it is!

00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:41.780
K: Jhan!

00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:42.660
A: Eh? Eh? EEEEHHH?

00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:44.940
A: Eh? Waaahh! Eh?
Aki: Let me see

00:07:45.195 --> 00:07:46.195
K: What do you think?
AI: Incredible!

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:47.880
Aki: That was fast

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:48.500
AI: Ah!

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:49.380
K: That's right

00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:51.780
K: You have from a gift bag up to a binder
AI: Eh? Eh? Eh? Eh? Eh?

00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:52.740
AI: There's... there’s...

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:55.860
AI: ...A "me" with a Nendoroid form!
K: That's right!

00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:59.240
K: We use a deformed illustration Nendoroid style to make this product

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:00.380
Aki: Haven't you started manufacturing it already? (lol)

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:03.300
AI: Eeehhh? It's so adorable!
K: Ssshhhh! That's right...

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:06.620
K: Well, we suggested this design in secret
Aki: In secret

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:08.400
AI: Incredible! Incredible! Eh?

00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:09.360
AI: Also...!

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:12.220
AI: ...I have my pins with my Install face!
K: That's right!

00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:12.840
K: These...

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:14.620
AI: Incredible!
K: It’s really cool, isn’t it?

00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:18.220
AI: Everything has something different in between them!
K: That's right, there's small differences

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:24.840
AI: Well, normally in Comiket, there’s people that take a lot of bags, right?

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:26.780
AI: The bags...
K: That's right, that's right, this...

00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:28.380
Aki: Ah! They’re bags that match with the products, right?
K: That's right

00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:28.880
Aki: It’s true

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:31.780
K: When the people go walking with this on their hand, everyone will say: "Ah!"

00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:33.600
K: "It's Ai-chan!" or something like that
Aki: "It's Ai-chan!"

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:35.460
Aki: Ai-chan, you’ll do a ceremony for the delivery of products, right?

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:38.360
AI: Ah! I’ll do it! I want to do it!

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:39.420
Aki: How can you do something like that?

00:08:39.420 --> 00:08:40.260
K: A delivery ceremony?

00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:41.340
AI: Well... I could...
K: But...

00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:43.360
AI: ...Say "Thank you!"

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:45.755
K: Ah, but I think that's a good option

00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:47.440
K: You can do an event where you greet with your hands, right?
Aki: Right?

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:48.460
Aki: You can do it while there’s a monitor
AI: It’s true!

00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:51.980
AI: Eh? Eh? But, I think that... it's so marvelous...

00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:53.600
AI: I feel like as if it was a dream... I... I don’t...
Aki: Right?

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:55.480
AI: I don’t have words to describe it!

00:08:56.860 --> 00:08:58.160
Ai: Well... you know...

00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:00.020
AI: I... you know...

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:02.460
AI: It’s a pleasure working with you guys!

00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:03.840
Aki: The pleasure is ours!

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:05.380
K: It’s a pleasure working with you!

00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:07.680
AI: Listen, director...
Aki: Yes, yes...

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:11.340
AI: Can I do a video about what happened here?

00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:14.260
Aki: You’re... you’re recording this?

00:09:14.855 --> 00:09:16.280
Aki: You’re recording?
AI: Ah, it's true!

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:18.120
AI: Since I’m a Super A.I....!

00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:19.620
Aki: How adorable
AI: ...It’s a piece of cake for me

00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:22.820
AI: I did it in case we had an agreement

00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:24.720
AI: To have evidence of that! Right?

00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:27.580
Aki: To test what we promised, right?

00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:29.040
AI: That's right! That's right!
Aki: Good

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:30.940
Aki: Even though we haven’t said "Ok", right?

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:31.820
AI: Eh?

00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:33.280
Aki: Ok!
AI: W-wait...

00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:34.600
AI: Aaaahh! Yaay!

00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:36.020
AI: Yaay!

00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:37.580
AI: Did you all hear?
K: How adorable

00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:41.060
AI: The executive director gave me the "OK"!

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:42.540
