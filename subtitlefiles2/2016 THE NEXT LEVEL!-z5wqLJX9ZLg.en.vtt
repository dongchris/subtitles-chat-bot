00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
Phil: Hey everyone so 2016 is over and Wow! it was definitely one for the history books

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:06.760
Wes: I know we literally say that every year

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:08.640
Phil: no joke like every year we say that

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:10.300
This year was truly our biggest yet

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:14.340
2014 may have been one of the biggest and most important years in Wong Fu's hist...

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:15.880
what an amazing year 2013 was

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:17.860
Wes: but this year was the biggest year yet

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:21.240
So much has happend and we know it's hard to keep up with everyhing

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.240
so we made this quick recap of all the big news and videos you might have missed

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.360
Phil: and if you did miss anything you can find a link to it in the description below

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.820
also be sure to follow us on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Snapchat for all the updates

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.900
Turn up!

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.580
So we hit the ground running by celebrating the 10 year anniversary of one of our classic shorts

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:38.480
''Yellow Fever''

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.980
We made a sequal to showed that nothing has changed …

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:42.300
or has it?

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.520
Wes: one thing though ... has changed for sure

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:46.140
Ted got married!

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.180
Video: "You may kiss the bride"

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.200
*Cheers*

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.560
Wes: It is truly surreal to be a part of Ted and Caty's big day

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.600
We both spoke and um... well one of us ugly cried

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.440
Phil: uhhh it wasn't that ugly

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.160
Wes: We're so happy for them and their bright future together

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.900
Phil: Megan Batoon showed us the smellier side of relationships in our sketch, "My Girlfriend Farted"

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.340
Wes: Then Yoshi and Noah how cutthroat auditions can be like in "The First Asian Jedi"

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.740
Phil: In March we started a new show where we responded to Youtube comments

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.740
Proving that we read all the comments

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:19.640
Wes: First!

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.340
Everyone: aaaahhhhh

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.420
Ashley: The fan interaction continued on More Wong Fu

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.580
when we launched a new series called "Failed It!"

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.800
Phil *in video*: When I'm done here, you're gonna be a whole new you

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.920
Ashley: A show where we try unique challenges

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.920
and let the fans vote if we nailed it...

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:34.200
or...

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.180
failed it :(

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.180
*In video*: OOHHH *laughs*

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.860
Wes: We teamed up with Nigahiga to do the unthinkable

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.600
Ryan *in video*: Why don't we make a k-pop band?

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.300
Wes: Ryan, Philip, David, Justin and Jun

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.060
formed Boys generally Asian or BgA

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:49.300
The greatest k-pop group of all time

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:51.660
Phil: But really it was just fun to pretend to be k-pop stars

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:53.460
and give the fans the full experience

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.720
composed of trailers, countdowns, member bios, dance version, practice versions

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:00.120
our song even ranked on the k-pop charts!

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.600
BgA mania definitely spread around the world

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.920
Wes: Then went out of this world with our Star Wars fanfilm "Way to the Rebellion"

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.160
Starring Chris Dinh and Brandon Soo Hoo

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:11.840
We've been such huge fans of the saga

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.200
so it was really exciting to create an original story in the Star Wars universe

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.120
Phil: In April, our first feature film "Everything Before Us"

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.960
finally made its way to Netflix!

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.460
*In video*: Hey there Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.240
we're your new neighbors

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.700
Phil: and it's still there for everyone to watch so

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.700
go watch it and give a good review!

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.400
Wes: Big steps continued as we started production on our first original series "Single by 30"

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.340
Wong Fu's largest production to date

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.040
and spend months of work behind the scenes

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.760
Phil *in video*: Got it

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.720
While Phil and Wes were busy shooting, the rest of the team held down the fort and

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:51.320
produced: "My Best Friend is Hot", featuring Victoria Park, Mike Bow, Elva Ni and … Taylor's guac.

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:56.020
In June I went back to my old University UC San Diego for one of the highest honors of my life

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:57.900
giving the commencement speech at graduation

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.800
There are two subjects that everyone my age talks about throughout your twenties.

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:07.080
It was the most nervous I've ever been but the speech actually ended up teaching millions of people online.

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.220
While we were down in San Diego we realized that it's been 10 years since

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.380
the last time Wong Fu made a lip-sync video

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.600
so the whole gang got together to make a lip-sync to Justin Timberlake's "Can't Stop The Feeling"

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.880
all around UCSD, just like old times back in college.

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:24.140
Back on our second channel Christine produced and starred in her own show "XOXO Christine"

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:28.800
where she covered everything from making flower crowns to … asking the tough questions.

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:33.600
What are your current thoughts about love like right now, 30-year-old Phil?

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:36.720
Joanna and Eric couldn't stop touching each other.

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:38.380
Why would we want that?

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:42.860
While Phil and Alisa showed us that some people in our lives will always be untouchable.

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:49.020
In August "Single by 30" was released on YouTube Red starring Harry Shum Jr., Kina Grannis

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:51.740
and a bunch of familiar faces from the Wong Fu family.

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.320
That was unreal.

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:57.480
It's Wong Fu's biggest project to date with eight 30 minute episodes

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.080
It's a show that has taken Wong Fu Productions to new heights

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.220
literally the show was up on billboards!

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:07.140
We were even featured on Entertainment Tonight, NPR and the LA Times to name a few.

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.260
LaurDIY and Alex Wassabi had to pretend that they couldn't kiss each other

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.440
for our short "This is how we never made out".

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:17.420
And we partnered with Vitasoy to make "From Here on Out"

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:20.920
a story about leaving home and seeking adventure starring Lawrence Kao and Julie Zhan.

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:26.000
And that inspired us to leave our office and start a new show "Wong Fu Recess"

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.480
where we competed in different sports and playground games

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:33.360
A rivalry was born between the Passive Pandas and Respectable Rhinos

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:37.260
We even designed som e slick team shirts for you guys to rep your favorite team

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:40.820
if you liked those, stay tuned for some more merch campaigns coming soon.

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:43.380
In more news about our movie "Everything Before Us"

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:47.960
it became available for everyone on DVD and Blu-ray. You can get your own piece of Wong Fu history today!

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:50.560
and there's even a bonus short starring Randall Park

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:56.400
In a fun sketch "Girls Can't take a Hint", Taylor proved that maybe guys are the ones that can't take a hint.

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.140
Point of view?

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:02.060
In one of the most random but awesome highlights of the year we went to Florence, Italy

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:04.220
to meet Ron Howard and Tom Hanks

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:07.860
Somehow rapping happened and it was so epic that the Today Show mentioned it

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:09.720
and even Snoop Dogg shared it on Facebook.

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:12.020
Rapping wasn't all that happened in Italy though,

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:17.040
we also went to Rome to shoot a short about love locks. It was our first time shooting in Italian.

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.060
Our show "Lunch Break" went on the road in partnership with McDonald's

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:23.280
and we got to shoot with our first ever live audience.

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:28.440
It was a blast meeting our friends in Katy, Texas and we even got a surprise visit from KevJumba himself!

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:37.100
Lily from ClevverTV showed us why you can't trust your friends with your phone. Not even for a second.

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:39.340
No! You can't put a period after sorry!

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:41.520
That makes 'I missed you' a completely new thought.

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:46.280
And YouTube gave us our half second of Fame in their annual Youtube Rewind Video.

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:47.440
Thanks YouTube!

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:53.440
In the spirit of the holidays More Wong Fu revisited all of its shows by releasing holiday specials from each of them

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:55.800
Happy Holidays and a Merry Christmas!

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:57.560
Cheers guys, cheers

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:00.700
then Randall Park exposed Santa for what he really is

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:03.020
Santa … is asian

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:05.280
O … kay?

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:10.660
To cap off 2016, Kore Asian Media honored us with the Digital Influence of the Year Award

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:13.040
along with many other Asians in entertainment.

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:15.560
Our community has seen a lot of achievements this past year

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:17.960
none of which would have been possible without your support

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:21.880
So thank you for sticking with us in 2016 and we hope you join us in the new year.

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:26.920
If history has taught us anything 2017 will be our … biggest year yet!

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:28.520
Bye!
