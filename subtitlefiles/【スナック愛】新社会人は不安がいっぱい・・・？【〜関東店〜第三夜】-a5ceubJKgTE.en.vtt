[door bell ringing]

00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:02.660
Welcome back! It's me, Ai.

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:06.640
Tonight, I will listen to all your worries, complaints, grudges...

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:10.690
I'll contain all of those for you gently.

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:12.520
How are you doing these last few days?

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:14.910
There's quite a drastic change in the weather.

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.690
Does that made you feel unwell?

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:17.950
Are you fine?

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:20.720
If you catch a cold, please take a break and rest.

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.400
You can have your champagne later.

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:24.170
- Oh, welcome!
- [door bell ringing]

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:25.970
Is it your first time here?

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:28.460
The counter's open, so if you wish...

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.660
Can you tell me your name?

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.200
I'm the mama here, Ai.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.480
Chiriin-san?

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:35.980
Chiriin-san's so cute!

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:37.080
Nice to meet you!

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:38.340
Why are you here today?

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.420
Oh, what do you want for drink?

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.560
For today, I recommend things like wine...

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.080
You don't really like those?

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:45.130
Then how about...

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:47.060
Kahlua Milk?

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.940
You want some?

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:48.810
Okay, okay.

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:51.140
One Kahlua Milk, please!

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:52.820
Let's talk for a moment.

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.130
How old are you?

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:55.770
22 years old?

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.040
You're so young!

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.520
So you just got employed... Ah!

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:59.930
You're on internship?

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:01.370
Like you're waiting for graduation?

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:03.160
I see, you're working hard.

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.010
You got accepted for a job? Awesome!

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:05.900
Hmm, hmm!

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.530
So you're glad about it, hmm.

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.690
So you're nervous?

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:12.540
I understand, it's getting into you.

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.010
You're even more nervous because you don't have any experience.

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:16.740
So you don't have any friends there.

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.640
So you want me to cheer you up.

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.130
I see. Thank you.

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.817
You knew this place from word of mouth?

00:01:22.285 --> 00:01:23.640
I'm quite famous around the internet?

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:24.920
Wow, I'm so glad!

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.910
When you get home, please help spread the word.

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:28.910
On your pub travels, please.

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:31.588
So I'll wrap up this counsel's content.

00:01:32.354 --> 00:01:34.217
Pen name Chiriin-san.

00:01:34.742 --> 00:01:36.780
Hello, nice to meet you.

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.884
I'm a newly employed 22 years old Pokemon fan.

00:01:41.268 --> 00:01:43.500
I'm still on internship, to be exact.

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.845
Last year, I got interviewed by a hotel company and passed.

00:01:47.668 --> 00:01:50.130
I'm really happy about it,

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.668
but I'm also very nervous.

00:01:52.628 --> 00:01:56.410
The work I've done so far was at my university's gym.

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:00.617
I have no experience in hotel work other than the one training I had.

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.120
And I have no acquaintances there,

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.577
so when I think that I'll be there all by myself, I get so nervous, I can't even sleep.

00:02:08.285 --> 00:02:12.857
Please give my your words of support that will cheer me up.

00:02:13.131 --> 00:02:15.370
Right? Of course you'll be nervous.

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:20.140
Because you have no friends there, that means it's your chance to create new connections.

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.650
Of course you'll still feel nervous about it,

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.360
but you shape your relationship with others from there.

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.560
Whether it's good or bad, it depends on you.

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:29.760
You're so nervous you can't sleep?

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.330
Ah, I see. I see.

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.520
It's alright! If you passed,

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:37.490
that means you are chosen because you are deemed necessary.

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:39.580
So I think it's fine to be confident about it.

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.500
I think it's not just Chiriin-san,

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:47.580
there must be others who are there without any friends.

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.140
So with that, you can get close with them.

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:51.560
Because you're in the same condition,

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.610
you can empathize on the same thing,

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.550
so you can have a long chat.

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:56.810
I think you're going to be alright.

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:58.530
It's the hospitality industry.

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.780
If you got interviewed and accepted, it must mean that you have some good charms.

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.510
Just be confident, it would be better if you can get rid of your anxiety...

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:11.070
But how about you take it as your excitement about finally having a job?

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:15.820
When you're stressed or need to take something off your mind,

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:19.040
you can come back here and drink a lot.

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.710
And I will also be here.

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:24.860
Bring along your friend, someone you're close with.

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:29.250
You make your new friends there and bring them here.

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.940
I will help make the conversation flow so that you can have a nice chat.

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:35.960
I'll be glad if you want to recommend this place too!

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:39.520
Like "Look! It's the Virtual YouTuber that's hot right now!"

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:40.650
That's annoying?

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:41.740
Yeah, I know that.

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:45.320
Well, there's that SNS service that's spreading right now.

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:47.950
It can show you people who work at your place, right?

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.230
How about you try to get friendly in advance?

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:53.930
Then you're not going to be as nervous as before.

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:56.210
Cheer up! You have to try as much things as you can!

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:57.480
Go for it with confidence!

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.220
I'll be cheering for you too! Good luck!

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:01.580
Did that cheer you up?

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:02.500
I'm so glad.

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.227
How was the Kahlua Milk? Was it good?

00:04:04.765 --> 00:04:07.620
Right? It has milk in it, after all.

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:10.510
Like it pumps you with calcium and gets you all worked up!

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:14.130
Your body be like "boom!", overflowing with milk power.

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:15.360
I said that, so no mistaking it.

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.410
Well, it's a little early...

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:21.100
But I have to wake up early for tomorrow.

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:23.500
Yeah, yeah, I'm sorry you can't stay here for much longer.

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:25.530
Was I of any help to you?

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:27.240
Really? That's good.

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:28.300
Yuuki, the check!

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:29.180
Oh, right.

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:32.670
When you get the bill, there's this check thing, get it?

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:34.780
I'm trying to show off a little, so look.

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:36.610
Please visit again, I'll be waiting.

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:38.262
Bye bye, thanks!

00:04:38.662 --> 00:04:40.660
Good luck! Guts, guts!

00:04:40.994 --> 00:04:42.045

When you enter the snack, any of your worries,

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:46.930
complaints,

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:48.020
and grudges,

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:49.920
I'll be waiting for you to share.

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:52.720
I'm virtual, so please tell me about it via email.

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.620
I'll always be waiting for your return.

See you later.
