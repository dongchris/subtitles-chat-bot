00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:10.880
[Girl voiceover:] Hmm, who do we have here?

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:14.820
[Guy voiceover:] Yeah, I'll definitely get a much better view of her over here.

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:16.840
Of all the empty benches here,

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:21.360
he chooses the only one in front of me. Could he be any more obvious?

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:27.920
Shoot! Of all the empty benches here, I chose the one in front of her. Hope it wasn't too obvious.

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:29.140
Well, I can't move now.

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:30.600
At least he's cute.

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:31.780
Man, she's cute!

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.400
Well-dressed, well-groomed, nice shoes, looks tall!

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.420
So cute! I better sit in a cooler pose!

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.140
Nope...

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:47.440
But not slick.

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.200
Oh yeah! I look good now.

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:56.260
Dang! Is she lookin' at me? Pshh! Well if she's not gonna look, I will.

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.040
Hmm... reading health magazine. Guess that means she's...

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:03.320
healthy.

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.120
What's he reading?

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:08.579
The New Yorker? Who the hell reads that?

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.460
I guess he's cultured, intelligent.

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:13.340
We could go running together.

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.400
Smart and hot? That's fair.

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:21.700
I wonder what she's doing here in the middle of the afternoon. I guess Parsons is close by. Maybe she's a fashion student. Cool.

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.560
That'll explain her floral pants.

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.480
It's the middle of the day. What's he doing at this park?

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:32.429
Ooh, maybe he runs his own business!

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:37.840
Okay, now you HAVE to say something. She smiled at you.

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.880
All right, that was definitely more than a glance. He smiled.

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:43.080
Come on, say something!

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:47.740
There's no one else here. There's nothing to lose. No one would see you get rejected.

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.820
Oh my gosh! even in your imagination you get rejected. Loser!

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:53.720
Okay, how should I start?

00:01:54.280 --> 00:02:00.240
I've never seen you here before. Nice day, huh? Excuse me, where'd you get those awesome floral pants?

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:02.100
Hello? Anything?

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:03.120
Hmm...

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.880
Oh my gosh. I've been reading this same paragraph for ten minutes.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:08.980
Oh, I got it! This will be perfect.

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:10.820
[phone rings]

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:13.660
Dang it!

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.820
[girl voiceover:] Okay. Be sure to look cute while you're talking.

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:17.220
[girl not voiceover:] Hello? Hey!

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:18.440
I wonder who that is.

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.700
Boyfriend? No, maybe just friend.

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.040
[girl voiceover:] Laugh, it'll show you're fun.

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.730
Okay, too much, too much.

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:29.860
Stupid funny friend.

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:38.480
Finally! Shoot, she probably thinks I'm alone. I know. I'll pretend to text someone.

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:47.450
Fine - if he's not gonna have the guts to say something first, I will. It's a new year, new you, girlfriend!

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.720
Why, why did I just call myself girlfriend? Okay, focus! Just say hi.

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:58.640
You know, she could say something to me first. Why does it always have to be the guy who makes the move?

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.780
Holy crap, this is scary. Guys have to do this all the time?

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.640
Okay, girlfriend. Let's do this.

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:13.040
Oh, my gosh. Did he seriously just check her out right in front of me?

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:15.280
Did that girl just fart as she ran past me?

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:16.980
[sniffing]

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.380
Eww. And he's like trying to take in her scent?

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:24.950
What the hell. Creep.

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:30.700
Okay, that was rude. I was trying to connect over teasing this smelly girl, and she gives me attitude.

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:35.580
She's probably one of those girls who thinks every guy looking her way thinks she's hot stuff.

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.600
Typical guy - just into any girl that moves.

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.420
She's not even that special. Looks high-maintenance.

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:48.189
I bet that was her boyfriend, or sugar daddy calling earlier. Probably buys everything for her. Like those ugly floral pants.

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:51.878
It's, like, four in the afternoon. What's he doing just at a park reading?

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:54.900
Probably doesn't have a job and comes here to creep on girls.

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:59.200
It's four in the afternoon, her boyfriend probably just lets her use his credit card.

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.340
Reading health? Just into her image.

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:03.180
Poseur.

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.940
Spoiled.

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:07.920
So glad he didn't say anything. It would have been a huge waste of time.

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:09.740
I could totally do better.

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:35.639
Oh my gosh, did he just check out that girl right in front of me?
