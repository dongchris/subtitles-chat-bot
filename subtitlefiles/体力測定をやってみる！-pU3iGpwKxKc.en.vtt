Yahoo-! Hi!

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:07.760
Is everyone watching?

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:10.040
I'm Virtual Youtuber Kizuna Ai

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.280
I can move around freely~

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:15.540
Did you think I'm just a picture?

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:16.940
Sorry to disappoint you

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:18.340
I can move a lot!

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:19.180
Look Look~

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:20.400
Ah

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.180
By the way

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:21.860
I will keep doing this

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:23.080
until everyone is bored, or rather,

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:24.220
until I'm bored of it~

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:25.520
Please stay tuned!

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:26.020
Okay!

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:27.560
Let's get down to business,

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:28.200
Tada!

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:31.420
I'm gonna conduct a physical strength fitness examination~

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:33.320
In elementary schools or middle school

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:34.640
haven't you guys

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.460
done something like that too?

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.000
A, B, C, D

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.520
Something like that

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:39.500
Even though I think that

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.520
the physical fitness examination is something that only humans do,

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.700
who knows what would happen if an AI like me does it?

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.120
I'd probably break a World Guinness Record or two!

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.360
I totally think I can do this! (Guinness record)

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:49.500
The physical and fitness examination items that

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.000
I would like to challenge this time are,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.600
here they are!

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.640
Tada!

and Side-step test!~

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.400
I shall conduct the examination

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.080
with these four items!

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.360
First, I gotta do some warm-ups

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:12.260
Ready, and-

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:13.160

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:17.240

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:18.200
seven,

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.820
eight

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:20.000
What else do I do?

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:20.900
I guess it's something like that?

Alright!

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.080
I've completed my warm-ups!

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:33.200
Now,

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.900
let's get started with

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.020
the Trunk Lift!
(Joutai sorashi)

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:37.340
Officially,

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.740
this item is supposed to be called Abdominal Trunk Lift!
(Fukuga joutai soroshi)

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:41.580
This one uses the back muscles, yeah?

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:42.640
Here, something like,

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:44.000
that, yeah?

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.940
By the way,

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.180
I've checked out the average score for females and

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.360
it seems to be around 55cm!

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:51.640
It'll be a piece of cake~

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:53.780
I think I'll probably reach a metre easily~!

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:54.680
Ah- uhh,

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.060
I think you guys aren't able to see it but

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:58.500
There is a magical-

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:00.500
mat over here

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.340
AI Channel's Physical Fitness Examination,

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:04.840
Trunk Lifts,

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:05.920
Start!

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:08.300
With that,

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:09.620
I would like to start

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:11.560
Ready and,

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:12.340
fuuuu!--

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:14.100
Ugh

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:14.880
uhhh

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.700
Urgh-

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:16.640
Ughh-- (laughs)

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:18.080
Urgh-

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.860
Are we

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:20.080
done yet?

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:21.220
Can you

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:22.000
measure?

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:23.280
T-This,

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.780
Is there anyone

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.160
who's going to do the measurements for me?!

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:27.460
Urghh

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:28.000
Guh...

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:29.480
(pants)

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.760
(pants)

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.200
These Trunk Lifts are

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:34.440
unexpectedly

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:36.620
tiring, aren't they?

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.960
Argh-

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:39.540
Okay

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:42.460
Well,

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:44.020
what's my record?

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.840
This...

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:49.340
The record is...

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.720
Okay let's see, the record is...?

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:55.520
Uh, it's approximately...

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:56.880
around 2 metres, yeah?

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.100
Though it's longer than my own height

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:59.520
Okay, next is~?

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:00.740
Vertical Jump!

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.260
Instead of running, I'll do a jump in place.

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.340
I'll determine the measurement from my jump

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.540
I'll swing my arms like this for the momentum.

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:08.820
I guess around like this.

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.640
The average for high school girl is 41 cm to 43 cm.

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.300
The World Guinness Record is 112 cm.

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:17.440
I intend to break the World Guinness Record...

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:19.440
So maybe up to about 200 cm.

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.680
With this mindset, I want to give it a shot.

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:23.840
Vertical Jump! Let's challenge!

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:24.760
Then, let's jump.

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:27.560
One, two ~

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.040
... what?

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:31.260
One, two ~

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:33.940
Uh?

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.480
One, two ~

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:37.480
what?

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.980
Is this...

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.900
...the feeling of being unable to  jump?

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:43.880
I'll try it once more!

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.020
It must be some kind of mistake.

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:47.520
One, two ~

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:52.000
Is this considered as a jump?

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:54.260
Is it a jump?

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:56.740
Could it be that I cannot jump?

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:58.420
Ehh?!

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:00.700
Why...

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:02.120
... is this function installed inside? (Note: VR plugin)

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.120
which means I can't jump?

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:08.340
Ehh?!

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:09.600
Okay back on track,

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.220
Next is Standing Forward Bend!

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:12.080
In here(room)...

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:15.280
Just like before, you guys won't to see this measure device, Sokuteiki, in this space.

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.120
I think I'll try on and use it.

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.380
In fact,  people with good eye could see it. (Note: look up Sokuteiki to see it and how it work)

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.320
Let's do a flexibility test on the softness of the body

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.560
Take a deep breath

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:26.660
and let it out slowly.

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.440
Don't exhale too hard. NG(No Good)

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:33.380
By the way, the average for female is also about 12 cm.

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.340
A.I.Channel 's Fitness Test!

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:36.720
Standing Forward Bend!

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:37.680
Start!

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:41.460
... what?

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.100
I can't reach my feet...

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:47.780
It's that. This is for sure...

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:49.420
because my legs are too long.

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:56.400
Uhh....

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:57.680
One more time!

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:01.940
This is...

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:04.140
This is is my limit.

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:06.900
I cannot reach it.

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:11.300
Well...

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:12.880
My legs...

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:16.220
I know how far I can reach down to my feet now. Let's move on!

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:17.520
Side Jumping!

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:19.260
The time set is 20 seconds.

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.360
Repeatedly jumping side to side. *pyon pyon pyon*

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:25.980
And then measure of how many times I jump.

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:28.260
During the time I make a side stepping,

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:30.420
There are three lines on the ground...

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:34.040
I have to properly side-step and cross the lines or else it does not count.

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:37.240
Base on how many time I pass these lines, it will be my record.

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:39.240
Honest, I am serious...

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:42.500
Because I appeared to be moving so well all this time. (Note: VR motion)

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:45.800
If I do not move here, then...

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:50.800
...I would feel like questioning myself, "How did I appear to be moving all this time?"

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:19.480
FORTY!

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:36.580
I'm not trying to catch a deep breath.

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:37.860
I'm not out of breath.

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:40.480
I am...

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:42.180
...an A.I. after all. (Note: Artificial Intelligence)

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:44.900
I don't do something like breathing.

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:47.500
That’s it,

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:49.140
My record is...

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:51.100
40 times!

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:53.840
Hurray!!

00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:57.120
I've tried my best.

00:06:57.380 --> 00:06:59.780
It can't be helped that I'm not more than the average female...

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:02.480

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:03.480
I'm just virtual.

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.140
It's cuter if I can't do it, isn't it?
