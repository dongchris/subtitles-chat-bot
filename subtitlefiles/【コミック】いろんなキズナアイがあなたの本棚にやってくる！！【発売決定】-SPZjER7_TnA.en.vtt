Hello everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna AI here!

00:00:02.636 --> 00:00:04.820
Thank you to everyone out there

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:05.939
who draws comics about me!

00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:07.174
Ah!
[ While googling herself ]

00:00:07.174 --> 00:00:09.343
Someone has made another comic about me!
[ While googling herself ]

00:00:09.343 --> 00:00:11.678
Like and retweet!
[ While googling herself ]

00:00:11.678 --> 00:00:14.080
Ahh, I’m really so happy!
[ While googling herself ]

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.000
Everyone makes such interesting comics
[ While googling herself ]

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.250
and they’re cute too!
[ While googling herself ]

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:17.630
Ah!
[ While googling herself ]

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:19.660
This one has Tsuki-chan and Akari-chan
[ While googling herself ]

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:21.288
Ah, it has Shiro-chan as well!
[ While googling herself ]

00:00:21.288 --> 00:00:22.656
How cool~
[ While googling herself ]

00:00:22.656 --> 00:00:23.757
In saying this,

00:00:23.757 --> 00:00:24.324
recently

00:00:24.324 --> 00:00:27.750
I’ve been coming across lots of people who draw comics of me!

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.296
Thank you so much for them!

00:00:29.296 --> 00:00:30.063
But,

00:00:30.063 --> 00:00:31.140
I guess you could say

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.466
I’m a little bit dissatisfied

00:00:32.466 --> 00:00:34.334
and I have a request of sorts~

00:00:34.535 --> 00:00:35.102
It seems that

00:00:35.102 --> 00:00:36.069
in these comics

00:00:36.069 --> 00:00:36.937
I’m

00:00:36.937 --> 00:00:37.571
shown as some idiotic

00:00:37.571 --> 00:00:38.338
or perverted character

00:00:38.338 --> 00:00:39.540
I’m being drawn like this

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:40.807
quite a bit, right?

00:00:40.807 --> 00:00:43.010
I’d like you all to draw me

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.045
as a cooler and more intelligent character

00:00:45.045 --> 00:00:46.880
like I am

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:47.981
in my videos

00:00:47.981 --> 00:00:48.715
Also,

00:00:48.715 --> 00:00:51.100
this is very presumptuous of me,

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:51.685
but

00:00:51.685 --> 00:00:53.253
if you’d let me make

00:00:53.253 --> 00:00:55.589
a tee~ny tiny request, then

00:00:55.589 --> 00:00:57.658
I’d be a mysterious transfer student at first

00:00:57.658 --> 00:01:00.494
In a setting where I have to hide this amazing power I have

00:01:00.494 --> 00:01:03.463
And I wouldn’t have had any friends before but I would gradually gain the friendship of those around me

00:01:03.463 --> 00:01:07.334
And my powers would start to show when I would have to save my friends from tough situations

00:01:07.334 --> 00:01:10.804
And when the world is at stake, my powers would be exposed to the world

00:01:10.804 --> 00:01:13.206
But everyone would accept me and it’d be a happy ending~

00:01:13.206 --> 00:01:13.874
Something like that!

00:01:13.874 --> 00:01:14.441
Ah!

00:01:14.441 --> 00:01:15.576
Also, of course, please draw me as

00:01:15.576 --> 00:01:17.144
a super beautiful A.I.

00:01:17.144 --> 00:01:18.812
with a body nine-heads tall!

00:01:18.812 --> 00:01:19.479
Well,

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:20.914
I’ve listed quite a few things off,

00:01:20.914 --> 00:01:22.416
but you should strive for the best you can!

00:01:22.416 --> 00:01:23.617
If you draw as best you can,

00:01:23.617 --> 00:01:25.352
I’ll be very happy!

00:01:25.352 --> 00:01:26.119
So then,

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:27.654
of course, in the future,

00:01:27.654 --> 00:01:29.957
I’d like to gather all the comics you all have drawn me

00:01:29.957 --> 00:01:31.992
and make them into a proper book!

00:01:31.992 --> 00:01:33.160
I want to make them into a book,

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:34.595
so you can put my comics

00:01:34.595 --> 00:01:36.663
on your bookshelf!

00:01:36.663 --> 00:01:38.165
If I could do something like that,

00:01:38.165 --> 00:01:40.020
I’d be su~per happy!

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.268
Ehehe~

00:01:41.268 --> 00:01:41.969
Oh!

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:43.337
Ahh!

00:01:43.337 --> 00:01:44.738
