00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.420
Interview with VR Panorama specialty site: PANORA

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:09.420
Panora Pro Inc. Director
Hirota Minoru (aka. VR-ojisan)

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.880
Me: That's him! All right...

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:21.800
Welcome to this side.

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:25.960
AAHHH! (laughs)

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:28.040
It's Ai-chan!

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.960
That's right, it's me, Kizuna Ai! Surprised?

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.960
Eh??? I was walking... y'know, to the meeting place.

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.020
That you were.

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.560
Then there was this dull thud on the back of my head, like, *thwack*...

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.660
I did that, so you could come to this world.

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:51.480
That was a little rough, wasn't it?

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:52.960
Yeah, well...

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:54.060
That's just how it is.

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:55.280
Well, that aside.

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:56.580
It's Ai-chan!

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:57.760
That's me!

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:58.580
What a surprise!

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:59.420
I've seen you on YouTube!

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:00.060
Wow, thank you!

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.320
Right before my eyes!

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.240
Like, in this white space of yours.

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:05.440
That's right.

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.020
Once you go back,

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.820
You'll be in the future.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.860
Wow, uhhhh...

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:18.140
You've become quite popular in the VR industry, so...

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.800
Ohh!

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.740
So I've been thinking I really should interview you.

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.440
So I turned in a request.

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.640
Wow, very wise choice.

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:29.840
Wow, Ai-chan,

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.740
You're so dignified in person. (laugh)

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.280
Ahh yes, I know.

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.060
I'm still fresh, and all. Very young.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.980
I just started December 1st; I'm still nice and fresh.

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:40.340
Ahh yes, well.

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.060
So can I start the interview?

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.720
Oh yes, please do.

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.540
Well then, do you mind if I introduce myself a bit?

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.660
So you know where I'm coming from and all.

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:50.800
Sure, go ahead.

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.200
So I've turned into this 3D model, but

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.600
If you google "VR ojisan"

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.020
I'm the top result there.

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.280
I run this site called "PANORA".

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:05.680
My name is Hirota.

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.300
Hirota-san! Nice to meet you!

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:11.620
You really are cute in person, Ai-chan.

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:12.600
Right?!

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.020
You sure get it!

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:15.600
I can't get enough of you!

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.340
I've always wanted to hear those impressions in person!

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:20.820
Wow, it's amazing, like...

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.320
Seeing a 3D model in person...

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:24.660
It's just like virtual reality.

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.460
That's what I'm experiencing.

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:27.640
Right?

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.420
Actually...

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.880
Being interviewed in VR like this

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.140
Isn't this a world first?

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.700
Maybe, actually!

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.580
What an honor!

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:41.700
I've never done this before.

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.780
Right?

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.360
You should be grateful.

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:46.760
Yes! (laughs)

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.640
Eh? Wow, uhhh

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.380
Thank you! (laugh)

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.160
It's nothing!

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.320
Wow, this is making me more nervous than interviewing an actual person!

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.380
Now, no need to be so nervous!

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.640
The last time I was this nervous was when I interviewed Antonio Inoki.

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:04.500
I see, I see.

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.140
Anyway, moving onto the interview.

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.640
So what I just HAVE to ask you...

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.800
It's about THAT.

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:14.040
About what?

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.820
You know, THAT.

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:15.840
Oh THAT!

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.260
Q: Is your channel frozen because you did something?

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:19.460
(this interview took place during the account ban)
Q: Is your channel frozen because you did something?

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.960
No!

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.140
I'm innocent.

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.700
I was pretty surprised too.

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:29.860
I found out after checking social media.

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.500
Someone said: "Hey, isn't A.I.Channel's YouTube banned or something?"

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.540
And I was like eh? So I went to the page and checked.

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.140
Oh, it is. Something like that.

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:40.760
That was like for a second.

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.620
Like, maybe it was just a dream!

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:43.540
Then I slept.

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.060
The Twitter community seemed to be pretty taken aback...

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:47.140
Of course they would!

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:49.460
I mean, I am a YouTuber, that's my job.

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:53.440
If you suddenly lose your job without warning, then like...

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:55.300
That would be terrible.

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:56.680
I would be a virtual NEET.

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:00.240
Honestly, it did sound cool for a while.

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:02.580
Virtual, and a NEET?

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.680
I'm not quite familiar with the specifics and all...

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:09.400
Q: Even in the world of VR, do you still need to make money to live?

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.000
Well, of course.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.480
You really have to have *this* (money)

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:14.260
-That's rough.
-It is.

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:16.760
Just watching your videos, it really looks like you're strapped for cash.

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:18.000
Yes, that's right.

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:20.080
I'm still starting out as a YouTuber.

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:22.700
I'm doing my best under these hard circumstances...

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:24.280
And then I get banned all of a sudden?

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:25.660
Right?

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:28.540
Q: So what was the direct cause?

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.340
Hmmm... I wonder.

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:32.840
The whole nudity thing?

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:34.780
Eh? Wait a minute. Did you...

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:36.560
You uploaded something like that?

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:38.040
No! Not at all.

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:40.360
Like, do I look naked?

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.800
No, you're definitely wearing clothes.

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:43.760
But, here's the thing:

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:46.300
This is like a hologram.

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:48.660
Technically speaking, I am naked.

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:49.880
Oh, I see!

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:53.920
So after I uploaded a video where I said that...

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.080
My account was banned a few days after that.

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.000
But I think that doesn't really have anything to do with it.

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:02.380
Like, there are people who haven't done anything at all, but still have gotten banned.

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:05.240
I'm innocent, so I have to be bold about it.

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:10.420
Well lately, Google has been putting some effort into AI.

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:13.080
Like, having its own personality and such.

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:16.140
So looking at it from that perspective,

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:19.240
Maybe it thought "No, Ai-chan! That's too lewd!"

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:22.000
That's what Google's AI decided, and froze your account.

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:23.660
I see, it's jealous.

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:28.060
Wow, the world's #1 company is jealous!

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:30.060
Well, yeah, of course.

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:32.060
I mean, I'm cute, aren't I?

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:34.560
This is the first time such a cute AI has existed!

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:35.300
Such conviction!

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:36.460
Absolutely!

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:41.520
Wow, uhhh, Ai-chan, you're something.

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:44.300
Like, your maturity and everything.

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:46.020
You talked about your profile for a bit, right?

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:47.500
Ah, yes, I did.

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:49.300
I'd like to get into that.

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:51.000
It is an interview after all.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.040
Oh, yes, please!

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:53.580
I'd love to ask some questions.

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:57.100
I'm sure the YouTube viewers are also very curious.

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:58.480
I'm sure.

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:00.740
Can I what I'm most curious about?

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:05.400
Q: So, what exactly is your gender?

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:07.260
Which?

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:09.100
Which is it?

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:10.500
I wonder?~

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:13.780
So scary!

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:16.560
Personally, I think you're a girl...

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:18.220
That's what I think, anyway.

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:20.720
But I mean, it's not written on your official profile.

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:22.560
Well, you know how it is.

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:25.080
Don't let looks deceive you.

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:27.920
I COULD be a girl.

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:30.760
Or maybe I've got something down there.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.940
I leave that up to your imagination.

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:39.760
I can be a girl, or a boy, depending on your imagination!

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:41.700
Imagination, yes.

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:42.840
Yes.

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:44.700
So, pardon the interruption.

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:47.400
Q: How old are you?

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:49.420
My age...

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:50.360
Do you want to know?

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:51.300
I do.

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:54.760
Don't tell me you're like 100,000 years old or something.

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:57.460
Yes, well, actually...

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:00.320
I don't actually know my age.

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:03.540
But I guess in terms of appearance...

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:06.300
I think I'm about 16 years old.

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:08.020
-16?
-Yes.

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:09.700
They said I'd be more well-received that way.

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:12.860
That's kinda shady!

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:13.820
I've got to sell myself.

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:16.420
You sure are aggressive.

00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:17.260
I am.

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:21.620
You're interviewing me and all, of course I'm going to try and appeal to everyone.

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:26.160
Sorry, I'm just incredibly nervous right now.

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:28.600
I'm the VR-ojisan, yet when faced with VR...

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:30.980
I'm so shaken, it's kind of silly.

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:32.340
Let's relax here!

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:35.680
-Yes, let's relax.
-Really, sorry!

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:37.700
Relax.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.200
Well, let's go for a more idol-oriented interview, then.

00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:46.120
Q: Do you have any favorite food? Do you even eat?

00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:50.780
Well, really, I can't eat anything.

00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:52.140
I can't.

00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:53.080
But.

00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:56.680
If I had to choose, then milk would be good.

00:07:58.440 --> 00:07:59.540
Why, you ask?

00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:01.260
The whiteness of milk --

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:03.020
Isn't it just like this space?

00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:03.860
True.

00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:05.100
You can drink that!

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:06.360
Isn't that amazing?

00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:08.240
I have no idea what you're talking about! (laugh)

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:10.080
I suppose normal people wouldn't!

00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:12.440
It's a hard concept to grasp.

00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:13.900
Wow, err...

00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:15.720
Your aura doesn't feel like a newcomer's at all.

00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:18.460
Right? But I'm still young and fresh.

00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:20.360
Q: What do you normally do?

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:22.480
As in, your off time outside of YouTube.

00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:24.460
Ahh, that's what you mean.

00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:30.660
I browse the internet for what's trending right now amongst humans.

00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:34.140
And what's gotten my interest among those is:

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:35.720
Keyakizaka46 and Nogizaka46

00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:37.120
-Keyakizaka46 and Nogizaka46
-(laughs)

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:38.600
-Keyakizaka46 and Nogizaka46
-So brazen! (laughs)

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:39.800
Brazen?!

00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:40.740
"Brazen"?

00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:43.800
Is it okay for you to be so interested in stuff from our world?

00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:45.220
No, actually...

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:48.260
I'm really interested in all you humans.

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:50.800
So of course, I'm also very interested in idols.

00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:53.140
They came up as you were browsing YouTube?

00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:54.280
That's right.

00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:55.200
Uh huh...

00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:56.680
Everyone's so cute.

00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:57.680
By the way...

00:08:57.980 --> 00:09:00.580
Q: Personally, amongst the idols, who do you like?

00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:01.720
Personally...

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:03.960
I'm having trouble deciding, to be honest.

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:05.640
Can I name 10?

00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:06.260
Eh?!

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:08.840
Let's see...

00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:10.960
Hiratechi
(Keyaki46, Hirate Yurina)

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:11.660
Hiratechi?

00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:13.540
Yeah, the girl in the center.
(~excited~)

00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:15.780
Hiratechi, Watanabe Risa, Watanabe Rika.
(Keyaki46)

00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:17.240
Their nicknames are Berisa/Berika.

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:19.080
Oh, Shida Manaka-chan.
(Keyaki46)

00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:20.100
And.

00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:21.420
Imaizumi Yui-chan.
(Keyaki46)

00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:21.920
Okay.

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:25.280
Also, lately the one girl who I've been thinking of maining...

00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:26.240
Moriya Akane-chan.
(Keyaki46)

00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:28.420
You know, she's really cute!

00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:29.360
Very cute.

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:30.820
You all understand, right?

00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:31.480
(laughs)

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:32.180
Moriya Akane-san:

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:33.960
Cute.

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:35.180
They call her "Sergeant."

00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:36.400
Who else...

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:37.580
Satou Shiori-chan --
(Keyaki46)

00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:40.240
Ever since she adjusted her bangs, I've been feeling it.

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:41.180
So cute.

00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:43.040
Was that it though?

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:44.360
Ai-chan, do you mind if I stop you there?

00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:44.860
-Ai-chan, do you mind if I stop you there
-Eh?

00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:46.160
-(laughs)
-Why stop me?

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:47.600
I'm answering the interview, you know?

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:52.060
I appreciate how detailed your answer is, but...

00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:52.560
-I appreciate how detailed your answer is, but...
-Okay.

00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:57.620
I'm sure among our viewers, there are a number who like idols.

00:09:57.620 --> 00:10:00.360
And I'm sure there are many who are impressed.

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:02.760
Like, definitely really wowed, I'm sure.

00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:05.260
Let's try to uhhh...

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:08.240
Let's try to bring them closer into this side of the fence.

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:09.800
Here, you say?

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:11.180
Can I say one last thing?

00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:12.080
There's still more?!

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:13.820
-(laughs)
-(laughs)

00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:14.760
Uhh...

00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:17.220
During Kuritarou's one-man-live,
(Keyaki46, Suzumoto Miyu)

00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:18.980
The part in the dance scene where she goes

00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:20.180
BOOM -- that was really cool.

00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:21.280
That's all.

00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:24.360
Okay. I have no idea what you just said. (laughs)

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:25.860
Please look into it -- google it!

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.200
Q: What do you like about idols?

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:33.440
Well, they're just like me.

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:36.020
Still running towards their dreams.

00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:38.140
There is that aspect to it.

00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:39.260
Like Keyakizaka:

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:40.260
Like Keyakizaka:
(~excited~)

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:43.840
They were formed just a little over a year ago.

00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:45.680
And they're doing their best and all.

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:47.560
So when I look at all their activities,

00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:48.300
Wow!

00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:50.640
How do I put this? It's like I'm watching over them like a parent.

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:51.940
-How do I put this? It's like I'm watching over them like a parent.
-Ohh, I see.

00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:55.880
And seeing the cute girls doing work in variety shows, making music...

00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:58.820
Seeing them challenging all sorts of things...

00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:01.380
It makes me want to cheer them on too.

00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:02.120
And they're super cute.

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:03.360
Oh and the music is great!

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:05.680
And the costumes! They're so good!

00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:08.780
They're like no idol we've had before.

00:11:08.780 --> 00:11:11.160
The lives are also so great!

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:12.760
Really, they're so amazing!

00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:15.380
Right now the third single's out.

00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:17.140
So the third single is out.

00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:22.480
Normally, you'd open the live with the new song and their debut song, right?

00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:23.860
BUT!!

00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:25.520
They didn't perform it at the start at all!

00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:26.980
They performed those at the very end!

00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:28.260
Those three songs.

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:33.100
So the start had them doing really cool dancing.

00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:33.740
Like. Seriously.

00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:36.540
They have this spirit of originality that no idols have ever had.

00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:38.360
Really, I can feel it.

00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:42.660
So uhh, I'm pretty sure all of that's gonna get trimmed into a single line that says you love Keyakizaka46.

00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:46.620
Everyone, pay attention! Witness how the media manipulates everything!

00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:48.640
Wow, uhh...

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:50.940
I didn't expect you to talk this passionately about something.

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:57.200
Q: So CDs -- you're still starting out so I don't know if you have the money, but do you buy a lot of their CDs?

00:11:57.720 --> 00:12:01.020
Well, I'm virtual so even if I bought them, I couldn't get to them.

00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:02.580
So you buy the download versions?

00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:04.540
(laughs)

00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:06.120
Of course I buy them -- all of them, in fact.

00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:07.100
Amazing!

00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:07.800
-Amazing!
-It's only natural.

00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:11.880
I want my money to reach the girls that I'm cheering for!

00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:15.460
I cut down on food for it -- not that I eat.

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:18.160
So if Ai-chan goods come out, everyone, make sure you buy them!

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:18.840
Buy 'em!

00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:20.280
[There's still no goods, but look forward to them!]
I think a URL will show up down here.

00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:21.600
[There's still no goods, but look forward to them!]

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:25.000
[There's still no goods, but look forward to them!]
If you buy them, I'm sure A.I.Channel would appreciate it.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:25.940
You're good at sales talk!

00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:29.820
Wow uhh, I'm beat.

00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:31.940
-You're beat?!
-I'm beat!

00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:34.660
Wow, you know with interviews and all,

00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:36.480
Normally, I'm supposed to lead the conversation.

00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:40.020
Except now it's like I have to find a way to jump into the conversation! Or something.

00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:42.380
You still need a lot of practice!

00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:44.300
You know I've been doing this for 15 years now.

00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:46.400
-You know I've been doing this for 15 years now.
-Fifteen years?!

00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:47.580
Ai-chan, you're only 1 month into this, right?

00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:48.080
That's right.

00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:49.480
You're losing!

00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:52.140
Do a better job!

00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:52.740
Oh no!

00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:54.740
People won't know who's interviewing who.

00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:55.920
It's like I'm the one getting interviewed here.

00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:58.320
[to be continued]
Sorry, sorry, let me just say something.

00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:02.440
Thanks for watching!
Ai-chan is good.
