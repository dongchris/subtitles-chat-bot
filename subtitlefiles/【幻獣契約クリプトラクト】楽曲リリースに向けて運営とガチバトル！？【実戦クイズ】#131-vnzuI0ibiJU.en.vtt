NoriP: That hurt!

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:05.720
Ah!

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:06.640
Ah!

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:07.900
You appeared!

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:10.940
Ai: It's you, NoriP-san
NoriP: Hello, I'm NoriP

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.420
Ai: It's a pleasure!
NoriP: It's a pleasure!

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:15.600
Ai: This means that it's time for Cryptract, right?

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:16.780
Ai: Eh?

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:18.140
Ai: Hey, hey, say something...

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.000
*laughs*

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.520
NoriP: Nice to meet you, it's always a pleasure working with you

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.460
Ai: The pleasure is mine!
NoriP: I saw the results from the video with Mamiruton-san

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:25.220
Ai: Oh!

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:26.600
NoriP: It was a resounding success

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:27.740
Ai: Yaaay!

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:28.400
Ai: Ah!

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.160
NoriP: Mamiruton-san is very adorable, right?

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:31.000
Ai: Are you talking about me?

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.940
NoriP: No, Ai-chan, you're also adorable, but...

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:35.520
NoriP: You did a competition between yourselves..
Ai: Yes!

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.200
NoriP: And that at the end was very entertaining
Ai: We did it

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:39.340
Ai: You know, Mamiruton-san has...

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:42.020
Ai: A character called Dorimia-chan, right?
(Mamiruton does the voice dub of that character)

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:42.740
NoriP: Yes

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:44.380
Ai: That's exactly what I mean

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:45.740
Ai: I also...

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:46.940
Ai: Will obtain...

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:48.720
Ai: My own character, right?

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.380
NoriP: It's possible, yes, but I don't have much authority to make it..

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:53.020
Ai: Eh?!

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.620
Ai: No!
NoriP: You know, NoriP doesn't have much power..

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:57.540
Ai: But I have a great artistic talent...
NoriP: Ah

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.500
Ai: I can draw a character and I can design their appearance and create their story!

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:02.600
Ai: And also if you prefer, I can...

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:03.180
Ai: You know...

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.780
Ai: I could add some kind of wings and many other things...

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:07.860
Ai: And I can also think of all their skills!

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.120
NoriP: You're very desperate!

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:09.760
Ai: What do you think?!

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:11.460
NoriP: No, well...

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.060
NoriP: I think it will depend on how hard you try

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.240
Ai: I'll work hard!
NoriP: I'll talk with the people in charge..

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.200
NoriP: What character class would you like to have?

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.700
Ai: Eh?

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:18.740
Ai: Hypothetically speaking?

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.060
Ai: Well, at the moment, my...

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:23.800
Ai: Team, my guild's name...

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:24.300
NoriP: Yes

Ai: Is Kizunazaka46..

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.700
NoriP: Yes

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.220
Ai: I stole the name from the Keyakizaka group idol but...

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.020
NoriP: *laughs* You stole the name?
Ai: BUT..!

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.280
Ai: Well, well, let's just say it's kind of a tribute from me...

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:32.940
Ai: Yes

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:34.000
Ai: That's why.. that's why...

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:34.500
NoriP: Yes

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.340
Ai: Definitely, I'd like it to be like an idol...

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.640
Ai: That sings and dances..

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.740
Ai: That's right, I'd like it to be a character who dances like an idol!

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.960
Ai: In fact, at this time, by Cryptract..

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:44.920
Ai: Well...

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.000
Ai: I'll sing, so please look at me!

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:46.500
NoriP: Yes

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.240
Ai: I think this way I can show you that I'm serious..

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:59.820
NoriP: We're talking about Cryptract

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:00.440
Aaah!

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:01.880
Ai: How disrespectful! How disrecpectful!

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.620
Ai: Well, it's just that I got so excited..

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.940
Ai: Eh?

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:06.780
NoriP: Yes, yes
Ai: I...

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:08.020
Ai: How did I sing?

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:09.220
NoriP: Well, you sang very well

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.000
Ai: Could this be your main song?

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.660
NoriP: Well, it could be...

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.700
Ai: "Well, it could be"...

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.480
NoriP: I see you're interested in singing the song of a character, right?

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:18.660
Ai: That's right!

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:20.980
Ai: The character that Kizuna Ai made...

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.340
Ai: I'll put my song!

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.420
Ai: Genjuu Keiyaku Cryptract!

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:26.900
Ai: "with Kizuna Ai" or something like that

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:28.680
NoriP: You'd like to do something like that, right?

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:29.520
Ai: Yes!

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:30.240
Ai: What do you think?

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:31.220
NoriP: What do I think...

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:32.300
*laughs*

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:34.420
Ai: I'll do anything

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.920
NoriP: Really?

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:35.420
Ai: Yes!

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.040
NoriP: Good, let's work hard

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.460
NoriP: A bit more...
Ai: A bit more...

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.660
NoriP: Well... If you try a little more Ai-chan...
Ai: Yes!

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:41.560
NoriP: It's possible it may come true

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:42.620
Ai: If I work hard?
NoriP: Yes!

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.180
NoriP: If you study more about Cryptract...

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:47.800
NoriP: And if you bring your knowledge to Cryptract...

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:48.480
Ai: Ah!

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.000
NoriP: There's a possibility that it'll happen

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:51.080
Ai: In that case...!
NoriP: That's what I think

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:52.160
Ai: Let's do a quiz!

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.860
NoriP: A quiz?

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:53.360
Ai: A quiz!

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.860
NoriP: Yes!

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.240
Ai: I'd probably able to answer everything correctly!

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.880
NoriP: Really?

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:57.380
Ai: Yes!

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:58.820
NoriP: Really?

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:59.740
NoriP: Do you know a lot?

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.880
NoriP: Have you been studying about Cryptract?

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:02.660
Ai: Of course..

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.400
NoriP: Since I thought something like that would happen...

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:06.240
NoriP: Today I prepared...

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:07.200
NoriP: A quiz..
Ai: Aaaaahhh!

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.460
NoriP: Good, shall we begin with the quiz?

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.960
Ai: Oh!

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.740
Ai: The Cryptract quiz!

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:12.820
Ai: Pafu, pafu!

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.940
NoriP: Good...

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:15.820
NoriP: Eh, within the following characters...

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.200
NoriP: Which of these is one that has a Leader ability..

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.860
NoriP: That increases the power of attack of their companions?
Ai: Oh!

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:22.840
Ai: It's a support skill, right?

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:24.040
NoriP: That's right

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:25.960
NoriP: 1) Lilianne
Ai: Yes

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:26.980
Ai: Oh!

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.480
NoriP: 2) Erubii

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:29.140
Ai: Oh!

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:30.840
NoriP: 3) Amaririth

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:31.560
Ai: Oh!

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.860
NoriP: 4) Bigmamu

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:34.900
*inhales*

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:38.240
Ai: I have none of these characters, right..?

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:40.060
NoriP: Even though they are very adorable, right?

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:40.960
Ai: They're adorable!

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:44.100
Ai: You know, Amaririth-chan is definitely cute!

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.940
NoriP: What's up?

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:47.440
*laughs*

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:47.940
Ai: Yes!

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:48.800
NoriP: Yes

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.200
Ai: Amaririth-chan!

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.940
NoriP: Incorrect!

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:53.200
Aaaaaaaaah!

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:54.420
Ai: But...

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.100
Ai: I don't have any of these characters...

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:01.020
Ai: How am I supposed to remember something I don't know?

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:02.200
NoriP: That's your excuse?

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:02.700
Ai: Yes..

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:03.780
*laughs*

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:06.180
NoriP: In that case, what do you think is the correct answer?

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:07.040
Ai: Eh?

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:08.180
Ai: Bigmamu!

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:09.240
NoriP: Correct!

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.880
Ai: Aaaah!

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:10.800
Ai: Damn it!

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:11.500
NoriP: You were close..

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:13.720
Ai: Well, on seeing it, it gave me the impression..

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:15.840
Ai: That it was very aggressive..

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:17.620
Ai: "It looked liked it was very offensive" or something like that..

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:18.120
NoriP: Mmmm..

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:19.860
Ai: It made me doubt myself!

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:23.480
NoriP: You can obtain Bigmamu..

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:24.080
Ai: Mmm?

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.100
NoriP: If you complete the missions called "Genjuu Toubatsu"
(Literally: Mystical Creature Suppresion)

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:28.000
NoriP: It's one of the rewards you get..

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.320
Ai: I'll obtain it!

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:30.460
*laughs*

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:33.120
Ai: I plan to get it..
NoriP: You plan to get it?

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:34.160
Ai: I plan to get Bigmamu..

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:34.880
NoriP: Bigmamu!

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:36.600
Ai: That which is on top of Bigmamu..

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:38.460
Ai: That kitty..

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:41.800
Ai: Is it a small "mamu"?

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.580
NoriP: No, let's say the combination of both is called Bigmamu

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:44.300
Ai: Ah, I see

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:44.800
*laughs*

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:45.860
Ai: It's not a "mini-mamu", is it?

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:46.540
*laughs*

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:49.000
Ai: Something like "Bigmamu" and "Mini-mamu"

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:50.460
Ai: Good!

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:52.820
Ai: Well, it's over! Ghan, ghan, ghan!

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:53.380
NoriP: Let's continue..

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:53.880
Ai: Oh!

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:56.040
NoriP: Within the following characters...

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:56.820
NoriP: Eh...

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:59.260
NoriP: Which character is the one that doesn't have a Leader ability..

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.680
That increases the possibility of obtaining items?

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.060
NoriP: 1) Ragdoll

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:04.940
NoriP: 2) Mindy

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:07.060
NoriP: 3) Jennette

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:08.680
NoriP: 4) Catt

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:12.500
Ai: Ah!

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:15.400
Ai: That one behind Jennette...

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:16.920
Ai: Isn't it Bigmamu?

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:18.100
NoriP: Oh, I see you're very observative!

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:21.020
Ai: That means it can be used in summoning mode, right?

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:21.600
NoriP: That's right

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:23.000
Ai: Ooooh! Victorious look

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:24.420
Ai: Eeeehh?

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:26.760
Ai: Well...

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:27.540
Ai: Yes!

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:28.200
NoriP: Yes!

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:30.000
Ai: Ragdoll-chan!

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:31.500
NoriP: Incorrect!

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:33.380
Ai: I won

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:34.020
Ai: Yes, yes!

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:34.640
*laughs*

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:35.520
NoriP: Yes

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:37.380
Ai: Minry-chan!

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:38.180
NoriP: Correct!

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:39.040
Yaaaaay!

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:40.780
Ai: She's very pretty, right?

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:41.680
Ai: She carries a cat-shaped umbrella..

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:42.600
NoriP: She's adorable

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:43.100
Ai: Man

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:44.220
NoriP: But that's not Minry..

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:45.280
*both laugh*

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:45.780
*inhales*

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:47.540
Ai: Of course not!
NoriP: Of course not!

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:50.180
Ai: It's often said that life is hard, right?
NoriP: Of course not, right?

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:51.280
Ai: Eh?

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:53.780
NoriP: Her Leader ability is widely used

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:54.360
Ai: Mmh, mmh..

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:58.460
NoriP: When creatures drop items...

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:03.160
NoriP: This Leader ability allows her to increase the probability of obtaining more of them..
Ai: Ah..

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:04.680
Ai: She's very useful!
NoriP: She's very useful, right?

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:05.640
Ai: She's very useful, right?

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:07.680
NoriP: That's why you should get this character as soon as possible

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:08.220
Ai: Mmm...

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:11.640
Ai: It's like instead of fighting, she's a more item-gathering character

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:12.260
NoriP: That's right

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:13.240
Ai: That sounds good

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:14.300
NoriP: Make sure to...

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:15.360
NoriP: Obtain her in the summoning..

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:16.660
Ai: Understood, leave it to me!

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:17.160
NoriP: I'll leave it on your hands

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:17.660
Ai: Yes!

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:18.340
Ai: Ah!

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:19.180
NoriP: Ah!

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:19.740
Ai: Yes!

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:20.560
NoriP: What's up?

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:21.540
Ai: Can I ask a question?

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:22.040
NoriP: Yes

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:25.000
Ai: Don't you want to test my ability to..

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:25.580
NoriP: Yes

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:26.720
Ai: You know, make names?

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:28.640
Ai: Definitely, as well as my ability to create characters..

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:30.040
NoriP: Well yes..

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:31.520
NoriP: I want to check it

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:32.240
Ai: I knew it!
NoriP: Yes!

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:33.940
Ai: Good, here I go!

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:34.640
NoriP: Yes

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:39.480
Ai: Personally I think that by its appearance, it might be suitable for Ragdoll-chan, but...

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:39.980
NoriP: Yes

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:41.200
Ai: The skill name might be...

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:42.880
Ai: "Eccentric"!
*Kizuna's Idea: Leader Ability "Eccentric"*

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:44.040
Ai: Doesn't it sound great?

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:44.780
NoriP: It sounds great

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:45.280
Ai: Plus...

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:45.860
NoriP: Yes

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:47.220
Ai: With respect to...

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:47.720
NoriP: Yes

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:48.820
Ai: The effect that possesses the Leader Ability

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:51.820
Ai: The turns are just conjecture, but...

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:53.940
Ai: By passing 35 turns...

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:55.640
Ai: Well, if you could...

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:58.980
Ai: Expect that amount of skills, I mean, turns...

00:06:58.980 --> 00:06:59.480
NoriP: Yes

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:00.340
Ai: You can defeat...

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:01.500
Ai: Randomly...

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:02.500
Ai: At an enemy!

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:04.600
NoriP: That sounds really incredible!
Ai: That's right, it's really incredible!

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:06.520
Ai: But it's not activated unless all those turns have passed..

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:07.020
Ai: What do you think?

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:08.060
NoriP: Sounds good

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:08.740
Ai: Sounds good?
NoriP: Sounds good

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:09.440
Ai: SHAAA!

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:11.420
NoriP: But we probably might not be able to use it..

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:11.920
Ai: Oh...

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:13.060
*laughs*

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:14.420
NoriP: But don't lose hope!

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:15.140
Ai: Oh! Good, good, good!

00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:16.020
NoriP: I'll tell the others about this

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:17.520
Ai: True, it's important to convey it properly..

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:18.440
NoriP: That's right, it's important

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:19.220
NoriP: I'll convey it to them

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:20.260
Ai: Humility is important, Kizuna..

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:20.820
Ai: Good!

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:21.900
Ai: Good, let's continue with the following!

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:22.900
NoriP: Question number three..

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.100
Ai: Yes! Te, ren!

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:26.620
NoriP: This is a question related to the feature of making contracts within the game..

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:27.120
Ai: Oh!

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:31.200
NoriP: Eh, Ai-chan, last time, you obtained Elizabeth during the summoning...

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:31.820
Ai: Yes!

00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:36.980
NoriP: Choose from the following options what you need to make a contract with Elizabeth..

00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:37.520
NoriP: There's four!

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:38.600
Ai: Four!

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:39.580
NoriP: That you need..

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:40.140
Ai: Good

00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:41.740
Ai: I think I already know two..

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:42.280
NoriP: Good

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:42.780
Ai: Here I go!

00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:43.880
Ai: I want to confirm it

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:44.380
NoriP: Yes..

00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:45.560
Ai: The first is number 2!

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:47.480
Ai: And later...

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:48.800
Ai: The number 4!

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:49.360
NoriP: Yes

00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:50.860
Ai: Plus...

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:51.360
NoriP: Yes

00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:52.720
Ai: Number 3!

00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:53.520
NoriP: Yes

00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:54.140
Ai: And...

00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:58.960
Ai: I'm hesitating between number 5 and number 8..

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:00.560
Ai: While definitely considering that she's dressed for a wedding...

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:01.060
NoriP: Yes

00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:02.480
Ai: It must be something white!

00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:02.980
NoriP: Oh!

00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:03.680
Ai: In order to combine..

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:05.300
Ai: But both are white!

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:08.540
Ai: Both are white, but...

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:10.680
Ai: Ah, but she also has something that's light blue...

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:12.600
Ai: Ah, both have something with a light blue color!

00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:16.120
Ai: Number 8!

00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:18.000
Ai: I choose 8 cause it's adorable!

00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:19.240
NoriP: Regrettably...

00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:20.220
Ai: Oooooh..

00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:21.540
NoriP: You're wrong..

00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:22.440
Ai: Which one was I wrong?

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:25.060
NoriP: Well... You were wrong on number 2...

00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:26.420
Ai: ..I already knew that

00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:28.120
NoriP: Well, the correct answer is...

00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:33.420
NoriP: Number 3, number 4, number 6 and number 7..
Ai: Oh.. oh!

00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:35.200
Ai: I was completely wrong!

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:37.860
Ai: I only got two!

00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:39.160
NoriP: You guessed them, didn't you?

00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:41.640
Ai: True, I was in doubt of what the right choices would be..

00:08:42.420 --> 00:08:43.200
Ai: I guessed, but...

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:45.240
Ai: I definitely didn't want to go wrong on the other two..

00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:46.920
Ai: Doesn't it happen at times?
NoriP: It's true..

00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:47.900
Ai: It was like a psychological pressure..
NoriP: Yes, yes

00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:49.420
Ai: I was very weak..

00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:50.380
NoriP: Well, have you memorized them?

00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:51.200
Ai: I memorized them!

00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:52.540
Ai: Three, four...

00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:53.660
Ai: Six, seven..

00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:54.340
NoriP: Yes

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:57.720
Ai: Now that I think about it, I remember that number seven was certain

00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:01.500
Ai: I was certain but I got influenced by the white color..

00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:02.940
Ai: Damn it!

00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:04.240
NoriP: Well, then we'll do a practical test!

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:04.960
Ai: Oooh!

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:08.960
NoriP: Eh, Ai-chan, you can participate in any mission you want using your favorite team..

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:09.540
Ai: Yes

00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:11.380
NoriP: And well... if you fight well...

00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:13.060
NoriP: Well, if you beat it without any problems...

00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:13.740
Ai: Yes!

00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:15.100
NoriP: We'll approve it..

00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:16.100
Ai: I seeee..

00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:17.560
Ai: Well...

00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:19.100
Ai: It'll be a piece of cake, right?

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:20.200
NoriP: Will it be a piece of cake?
Ai: After all...

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:22.000
Ai: I also won against Mamiruton-san, so then...

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:23.160
NoriP: It's true!
Ai: Yes

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:24.220
NoriP: You won against her, right?

00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:25.560
Ai: I surpassed my master

00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:26.060
NoriP: It's true

00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:27.240
Ai: *ashamed laughter* something like that, right?

00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:28.540
NoriP: Now she's also a member, right?

00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:30.440
Ai: That's right, that's right..
NoriP: Now she's a member of your Union

00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:31.920
Ai: I'm the master, right?

00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:32.460
NoriP: Master

00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:32.960
Ai: Yes

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:34.860
Ai: Good, I'm planning to play with this formation..

00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:35.580
NoriP: You're sure of using this formation?

00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:36.080
Ai: Yes!

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:39.080
Ai: This is the same formation I used to crush Mamiruton

00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:40.720
NoriP: You played a showdown with her, right?
(She did it in Mamiruton's channel)

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:41.220
Ai: Yes!

00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:44.480
Ai: Sonia-chan, Clarice-chan, Elizabeth-chan and...

00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:45.420
NoriP: Yes

00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:47.000
NoriP: Ah..

00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:48.680
Ai: Cut

00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:50.960
Ai: Lucre...
NoriP: Lucrecia

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:52.340
Ai: Lucrecia-san..

00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:53.160
*laughs*

00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:54.520
*inhales*

00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:57.220
Ai: She has a rather complicated name..

00:09:57.640 --> 00:09:58.400
Ai: And...

00:09:58.400 --> 00:09:59.060
NoriP: Yes

00:09:59.220 --> 00:09:59.940
Ai: This...

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:01.360
NoriP: What mission are you planning to do?

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:03.860
Ai: This... this great mission...

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:08.280
Ai: Can I do the mission of this character?

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:09.340
NoriP: Yes, that's fine..

00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:09.840
Ai: Good!

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:10.340
NoriP: Can you defeat it?

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:11.820
NoriP: It's very difficult...
Ai: Well, if it's about...

00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:15.640
Ai: Difficulty 4.4, for me it's like nothing..

00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:17.620
NoriP: Good, shall we try it?

00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:18.120
Ai: Yes!

00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:20.880
Ai: Good, within my friends...

00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:22.460
Ai: What's this..

00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:24.400
Ai: Character's property?

00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:25.000
NoriP: Light..

00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:26.040
Ai: Light?

00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:27.140
Ai: Then I should choose Dark characters...

00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:30.880
NoriP: But against the Light, definitely the Darkness won't...
Ai: Ah!

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:31.560
Ai: It's true

00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:33.360
Ai: In this case..

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:35.580
Ai: Ehey!

00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:37.400
Ai: I want her..

00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:40.100
NoriP: You plan on obtaining her in the summonings?

00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:40.880
Ai: Please..

00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:42.480
Ai: Hey!
NoriP: I'm counting on you

00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:43.760
Ai: Ah..

00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:45.120
Ai: She's really not appearing..

00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:46.860
Ai: I really want her

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:47.660
Ai: She should appear!

00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:48.360
Ai: She should appear..

00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:50.680
Ai: I'll do summonings until she appears

00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:52.580
Ai: I'll do summonings until she appears

00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:56.620
NoriP: What's the strategy you'll use for this battle?

00:10:56.620 --> 00:11:00.600
Ai: My strategy is to first use Clarice-chan to improve the stats of my group...

00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:02.660
Ai: And later I should find the right timing...

00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:03.160
NoriP: Yes

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:04.340
Ai: Elizabeth-chan...

00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:06.340
Ai: Has a two-turn ability, so then...

00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:09.820
Ai: I need to watch carefully to find the right time to do it!

00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:11.720
Ai: And also...

00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:13.980
Ai: With respect to Sonia-chan...

00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:14.900
Ai: Everyone can...

00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:16.720
Ai: Avoid dying from one hit, so then...

00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:17.220
NoriP: Yes

00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:19.420
Ai: That's one of the main points of my strategy..

00:11:19.420 --> 00:11:20.320
Ai: This!
NoriP: Yes

00:11:20.420 --> 00:11:22.580
Ai: I'll use the ability that takes 3 turns to activate..

00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:23.680
Ai: And then...

00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:25.260
Ai: While making use of the fact that I'm in advantage...

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:28.780
Ai: If I'm able to use Clarice-chan's ability to improve the stats...

00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:29.900
Ai: I can, well...

00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:30.800
Ai: Finish easily...

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:32.280
Ai: Finish my enemies easily..

00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:33.320
NoriP: I didn't expect any less from the master

00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:33.940
Ai: "Yes"

00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:36.600
NoriP: You have a surprising fighting system, you've gotten used to it, right?

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:38.280
Ai: That's right, I've been studying a lot

00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:39.200
NoriP: You've been playing a lot, haven't you?

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:40.640
Ai: Yes! I worked hard..

00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:42.720
Ai: Finally I reached...

00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:43.720
Ai: Finally I reached it..

00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:45.700
NoriP: Lucrecia?

00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:46.640
Ai: Lucrecia..

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:48.220
Ai: Lu...

00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:49.200
Ai: Listen, NoriP-san

00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:51.640
NoriP: Yes
Ai: Please repeat "Lucrecia" five times..

00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:55.380
NoriP: Lucrecia, Lucrecia, Lucrecia, Lucrecia, Lucrecia..

00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:56.340
Ai: Ah..

00:11:57.220 --> 00:11:58.280
NoriP: Try it yourself

00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:04.360
Ai: Lucrecia, Lucrecia, Lucrecia, Lucrecia, Lucrecia, Lucrecia..

00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:05.600
Ai: Did I say it?

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:06.100
*laughs*

00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:07.140
NoriP: You've been at the limit..

00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:08.400
Ai: At the limit!

00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:09.320
*inhales*

00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:10.680
Ai: Aaaah!
NoriP: Please concentrate!

00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:12.440
Ai: Ah! Ah! Ah, please look at this!

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:13.840
NoriP: Oh!
Ai: I already defeated one!

00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:14.860
NoriP: Without realizing it, you've already...

00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:15.880
Ai: That's right!

00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:17.340
Ai: Ah!

00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:19.420
Ai: Ah!

00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:21.920
Ai: Those attacks that have a counter are terrifying, right?

00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:22.640
NoriP: They're terrifying, right?

00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:25.400
Ai: That's right, it's very difficult to calculate the right timing to use the stat improvement skill..

00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:26.200
Ai: And this...

00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:27.120
Ai: Ah, right!

00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:27.620
Ai: This...

00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:28.540
Ai: Ah! Right!

00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:31.260
Ai: I'm glad that the two turns have already passed...

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:33.300
Ai: But I wish I could've improve their stats!

00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:34.820
Ai: It sometimes happens, right?

00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:36.060
NoriP: It's true..
Ai: That's right

00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:37.500
NoriP: But I see you're doing well without issues..

00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:39.380
Ai: That's right, I'm doing well!

00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:40.460
Ai: Good!

00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:42.820
Ai: Good! Good, good!

00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:44.520
Ai: What do you think of this?

00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:45.140
NoriP: Well...

00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:45.640
NoriP: You're doing well

00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:47.680
Ai: If you compare me with my weak self from before then...

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:48.940
NoriP: You've improved a lot, right?

00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:49.860
Ai: That's right!

00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:50.380
NoriP: Incredible

00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:51.240
Ai: Hahaha..

00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:53.440
NoriP: You've already completed the first wave, right?

00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:54.040
Ai: Good!

00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:55.600
Ai: Don't you think this it'll be really easy?

00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:56.540
NoriP: It looks like it'll be easy, right?

00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:58.960
Ai: I haven't lost any HP..

00:12:58.960 --> 00:12:59.500
NoriP: Oh..

00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:00.220
Ai: Oh..

00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:02.240
Ai: No, the boost skill...

00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:04.220
Ai: For the moment, I'll use it now...
NoriP: This part is difficult, right?

00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:05.560
NoriP: During the second wave, you should...

00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:06.200
NoriP: Well...

00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:08.640
NoriP: Accumulate skills in order to use them in the third wave...

00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:10.120
Ai: That's right, it's true

00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:11.600
Ai: But, with respect to that...

00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:12.860
Ai: You know...

00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:14.060
Ai: Elizabeth-chan...

00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:14.560
NoriP: Yes!

00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:15.220
Ai: Well...

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:18.220
Ai: Rather than needing to wait...

00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:19.900
Ai: I can...

00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:21.400
Ai: I'll use in only one turn...

00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:22.020
NoriP: Yes

00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:22.780
Ai: While I wait...

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:24.340
Ai: Since I can't use her too much...

00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:24.840
NoriP: Yes

00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:26.120
Ai: So then it's easy to use..

00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:27.020
NoriP: Oh..
Ai: Oh..

00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:28.100
Ai: Oh..?

00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:32.800
Ai: But the enemy is pretty formidable, right?

00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:34.480
NoriP: It's very powerful! Right?

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:35.740
Ai: That's right

00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:36.460
Ai: Hehehe..

00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:38.220
NoriP: You've gotten a lot stronger yourself, right?

00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:40.560
Ai: NoriP-san has also called me master..
NoriP: Master!

00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:44.780
NoriP: Master, can I join your Union?

00:13:44.780 --> 00:13:46.500
Ai: I suppose I have no other option

00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:47.240
*laughs*

00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:48.920
Ai: In return...

00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:50.100
Ai: You know, right?

00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:50.600
NoriP: Ah...

00:13:51.140 --> 00:13:51.640
Ai: Good?

00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:52.920
NoriP: What... are you talking about?

00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:55.500
Ai: Well, you know, of my song...

00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:57.460
Ai: Forming part of Cryptract...
NoriP: *laughs*

00:13:57.680 --> 00:13:59.680
Ai: And also my character appearing..

00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:01.340
Ai: Right?

00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:02.340
NoriP: It's true

00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:04.820
NoriP: Well, if you can beat the practical test of today...

00:14:05.140 --> 00:14:07.140
NoriP: And if you successfully complete the questions quiz..

00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:10.340
Ai: Well, I already beat the questions quiz, I got them all right..

00:14:10.340 --> 00:14:10.840
NoriP: Eh?

00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:11.340
Ai: Eh?

00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:12.980
NoriP: You were wrong in all of them!

00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:13.640
*laughs*

00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:15.080
Ai: I was wrong in all of them, right?

00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:15.880
NoriP: You were wrong in all of them!

00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:17.360
Ai: Wasn't that a dream then?

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:18.980
NoriP: Eh? It was a dream?

00:14:18.980 --> 00:14:19.720
Ai: That's what I think..

00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:20.820
NoriP: Do you dream?

00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:24.340
Ai: No, well, you know, the question about the contract in the game...

00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:25.260
NoriP: Yes, yes, yes, yes

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:26.300
Ai: Well...

00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:27.860
Ai: I guessed half..
NoriP: You guessed half, right?

00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:29.340
Ai: Look! Look! Look!
NoriP: Oh!

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:31.520
NoriP: Keep up the good work until the end!
Ai: Look!

00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:32.640
Ai: This is very easy

00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:33.760
NoriP: It's very easy, right?

00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:34.580
Ai: It finally appeared

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:37.540
Ai: That appearance with that lightning is...

00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:39.580
Ai: Ah? It's huge! It looks great

00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:40.660
Ai: Eh?

00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:41.800
Ai: It looks great

00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:42.860
Ai: Eh?

00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:44.300
Ai: If you're planning to make my character appear...

00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:44.800
NoriP: Yes

00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:45.620
Ai: In fact...

00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:48.620
Ai: What do you think if I think up of a monster too?

00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:50.020
NoriP: Yes, that sounds like a good idea

00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:51.680
Ai: With cat ears..

00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:52.420
NoriP: With cat ears?

00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:53.380
Ai: Even though it's actually an A.I

00:14:53.380 --> 00:14:54.040
NoriP: Although it's actually an A.I

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:54.900
Ai: Even though it's an A.I

00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:56.320
NoriP: In Mamiruton-san's case...

00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:56.820
Ai: Yes

00:14:56.820 --> 00:14:57.500
NoriP: Well...

00:14:57.960 --> 00:15:00.620
NoriP: The players sent us their drawings...

00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:02.100
Ai: Aaaahhh!
NoriP: And well...

00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:03.440
NoriP: That's how we created Dorimia-chan..

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:04.800
Ai: Ah, I see

00:15:05.220 --> 00:15:06.280
NoriP: It's cause of that...

00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:07.800
NoriP: That if you work harder, Ai-chan...

00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:08.900
NoriP: There exists a possibility that it will happen

00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:10.280
Ai: Oh, ho, ho...

00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:12.620
Ai: Ah, but you know, I'd like to take advantage of the opportunity...

00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:15.740
Ai: For people to be able to participate, right?

00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:16.360
NoriP: Yes, yes, yes..

00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:17.060
Ai: But..

00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:18.480
Ai: You know...

00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:20.100
Ai: I'd like to attempt to do the drawing

00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:20.760
NoriP: You want to do the drawing?

00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:21.880
Ai: I want to do the drawing, but...

00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:25.660
Ai: I could ask everyone to participate by contributing ideas for skills...

00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:27.540
Ai: And then be able to choose...

00:15:27.540 --> 00:15:29.020
Ai: Senbutsu? Senbatsu?
(Choosing is "Senbatsu")

00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:30.220
Ai: Choose?

00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:31.080
Ai: That's what I want..

00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:34.520
NoriP: You can do it in private

00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:35.380
Ai: In private?

00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:36.920
Ai: Eh?

00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:40.340
Ai: I can use someone else's idea...
NoriP: You can use another idea...

00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:41.880
Ai: And send it as my own...
NoriP: And send it as your own

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:42.700
Ai: I finished!

00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:44.760
Ai: Even though it's not my idea..

00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:46.820
Ai: How sad!

00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:47.700
*inhales*

00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:48.680
Ai: That's very sad..

00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:49.940
NoriP: It's very sad, isn't it?

00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:51.440
Ai: This is... Aaaahh! Wait!

00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:52.400
Ai: Ah, Eh?

00:15:52.980 --> 00:15:54.180
Ai: Ah, ah! I can still do it
NoriP: Ooohh...

00:15:54.180 --> 00:15:54.760
NoriP: That was close..

00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:55.660
Ai: I can do it, I can do it, that was close..

00:15:55.660 --> 00:15:57.900
Ai: Ah! Ah! Ah! I only need to wait one more turn, good job!

00:15:57.900 --> 00:15:58.480
Ai: Good job!

00:15:59.080 --> 00:15:59.800
Ai: Here I should...

00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:02.000
Ai: Eh? What is this? Fog? Fog?

00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:03.280
NoriP: It looks like it, doesn't it?

00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:05.260
Ai: Eh? What happens when there's fog?

00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:08.300
NoriP: If you're interested in knowing its effect, you'll now be able to see it..

00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:09.700
NoriP: As you can see...

00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:11.800
Ai: Ooohh!
*Weather (Heavy Fog) effect: Light-based units take less damage*

00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:13.420
Ai: Eh? Ah, I'm in trouble..

00:16:13.420 --> 00:16:14.800
Ai: I'm.. I'm in trouble..

00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:15.900
NoriP: You're in trouble, right?

00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:16.560
Ai: I'm in trouble..

00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:18.160
Ai: Ah, to top it off, it immobilized me with electricity!

00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:20.440
Ai: Even though I was waiting for the necessary turns!

00:16:21.420 --> 00:16:22.660
Ai: I have to start from scratch again!

00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:24.040
Ai: It's so unfair..

00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:26.220
Ai: And to think only one turn was left!

00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:29.580
Ai: That's why I was thinking of using Clarice-chan to improve their stats...

00:16:29.580 --> 00:16:31.020
Ai: Or that's what I wanted to do...

00:16:32.140 --> 00:16:33.400
Ai: It's unfair..
NoriP: It's unfair

00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:35.040
Ai: Aaaaugh!

00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:36.200
Ai: I'm in trouble, I'm in trouble...

00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:36.860
NoriP: You're in trouble

00:16:36.860 --> 00:16:38.760
Ai: The danger level is very high..

00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:42.800
Ai: I feel like I'm probably in trouble..

00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:44.320
NoriP: You're in trouble, right?
Ai: I'm really in trouble..

00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:44.820
Ai: Eh?

00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:46.760
Ai: What did you do?

00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:47.460
*laughs*

00:16:48.180 --> 00:16:49.140
NoriP: Is it my fault?

00:16:49.140 --> 00:16:51.820
Ai: Are you not intentionally interfering to avoid me completing the mission?!

00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:52.820
NoriP: *laughs* I'm not interfering!

00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:54.120
Ai: After all, I'm in trouble!

00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:57.160
Ai: Three turns!

00:16:57.340 --> 00:16:58.420
Ai: Resist!

00:16:58.800 --> 00:16:59.560
Ai: Noooo!

00:16:59.780 --> 00:17:01.520
Ai: Listen! Listen! Wait...

00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:03.480
Ai: Wait, calm down..

00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:05.020
Ai: At this time you must breathe deeply..

00:17:05.020 --> 00:17:06.740
Ai: *inhale, inhale, exhale*, something like that, right?

00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:08.000
NoriP: This giant enemy looks difficult..

00:17:08.020 --> 00:17:08.680
Ai: It's true..

00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:09.920
Ai: I'm in trouble..

00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:13.200
Ai: Stop, please!

00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:13.840
Ai: Eh?

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:14.720
Ai: Ah..

00:17:15.460 --> 00:17:16.780
Ai: Ah, I'm still alive..
NoriP: Oh, man...

00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:18.980
Ai: Ah, I died once...

00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:20.360
Ai: And returned...

00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:23.160
Ai: Stop it!

00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:25.700
Ai: Stop it!
NoriP: Your friend appeared to help you, right?

00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:26.820
Ai: My friend appeared!

00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:28.280
Ai: That's the character...

00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:29.420
Ai: That I always wanted to have!

00:17:31.860 --> 00:17:32.360
Ai: Ah!

00:17:33.060 --> 00:17:33.560
Ai: Eh?

00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:34.600
NoriP: Ah!

00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:35.380
Ai: Ah..

00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:38.380
Ai: That's right, times like these is when the power is activated...

00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:39.960
Ai: That revives you the first time you die..

00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:42.340
Ai: Hey!

00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:46.900
Ai: I want to obtain Tiana-chan!

00:17:48.980 --> 00:17:50.460
Ai: That attack is great

00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:51.760
Ai: I want to have her..

00:17:51.940 --> 00:17:54.000
Ai: I want to have Tiana-chan..
NoriP: *laughs*

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:55.580
Ai: Ah, if you get Tiana-chan...

00:17:55.900 --> 00:17:59.120
Ai: I could end this much more easily..

00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:00.420
NoriP: I won't gift it to you

00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:02.700
Ai: Of course, when will the next character appear?

00:18:03.140 --> 00:18:05.140
NoriP: The next.. well, yes...

00:18:05.140 --> 00:18:06.820
NoriP: If you try harder Ai-chan, then...

00:18:07.660 --> 00:18:09.200
Ai: If I try hard, will you gift it to me?

00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:11.220
NoriP: Well, our intention is to launch a new character..

00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:13.900
NoriP: If you try hard Ai-chan, maybe some day we'll gift it to you..

00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:15.000
Ai: I see!

00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:17.660
Ai: What's the next major update?

00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:20.420
NoriP: Well, it's a secret..

00:18:20.420 --> 00:18:20.920
Ai: Mmm?

00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:23.960
Ai: Ah, I'm in trouble..

00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:25.040
Ai: Eh?

00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:26.700
NoriP: I think this is impossible now..

00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:27.920
Ai: I'm in trouble!
NoriP: *laughs*

00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:30.000
Ai: What does this mean?

00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:31.340
NoriP: This is...

00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:33.300
NoriP: Useless, right?

00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:36.020
NoriP: Aren't you in trouble?
Ai: That's not true..

00:18:36.020 --> 00:18:37.440
NoriP: What... what do you plan to do? You still want to continue?

00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:38.640
NoriP: Ah, but you can still do it!

00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:39.520
Ai: It's true, I can do it

00:18:40.580 --> 00:18:41.700
Ai: I can do it, right?

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:43.100
Ai: Ah..

00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:47.140
Ai: They don't give me time to make my attack!
NoriP: With this, now...

00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:48.740
Ai: NOOOO!

00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:52.840
Ai: Oooh... it's the end now..

00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:56.360
Ai: Ah, ah... how did this happen?

00:18:56.900 --> 00:18:57.720
NoriP: There's no more hope..

00:18:57.720 --> 00:18:58.660
Ai: There's no more hope, right?
NoriP: *laughs*

00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:01.860
Ai: You can't... you can't do something about this fog?

00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:06.140
Ai: Aooohhhh!

00:19:06.140 --> 00:19:07.200
NoriP: It's very difficult, right?

00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:08.580
Ai: How can this be..?

00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:09.860
Ai: I'm really in trouble!

00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:12.180
Ai: I'm in trouble!

00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:14.160
Ai: I'm about to cry..

00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:17.440
Ai: I can't defeat anyone..

00:19:19.060 --> 00:19:19.780
Ai: Go for it!

00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:21.060
Ai: Go for it!

00:19:24.780 --> 00:19:25.280
*inhales*

00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:26.720
Ai: Go for iiit!

00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:29.520
Ai: I have no choice but to despair..

00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:31.200
Ai: Why..

00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:32.800
Ai: Can't I defeat them?

00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:35.880
Ai: Why can't I defeat them?

00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:37.980
NoriP: You don't have energy to try harder, right?

00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:39.040
Ai: I don't have enough energy!

00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:41.720
Ai: Maybe those enemies can recover?

00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:43.360
Ai: Wait a moment!

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:45.960
Ai: Let's calm down..

00:19:46.060 --> 00:19:47.040
Ai: Let's calm down..

00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:49.000
Ai: Eiyaa!

00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:53.740
NoriP: Now...

00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:56.120
NoriP: Only your character friend is left..

00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:01.100
Ai: Ah!

00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:01.760
Ai: Ah!

00:20:02.340 --> 00:20:03.380
Ai: I knew it!

00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:04.700
Ai: Eh? Did I die?

00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:06.520
Ai: They didn't die, right?

00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:07.460
NoriP: No, no, no..

00:20:07.820 --> 00:20:08.320
NoriP: Wh..

00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:10.640
NoriP: You just died there right, you just used a continue..

00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:11.340
Eh!?

00:20:11.660 --> 00:20:13.020
Ai: What are you talking about?

00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:14.480
Ai: Were you really watching?

00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:14.980
NoriP: I was really watching!

00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:17.120
Ai: Balloon eyes can't see after all!

00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:19.620
NoriP: *laughs* Don't blame it all on the balloon!

00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:21.680
Ai: No, I wasn't..

00:20:21.820 --> 00:20:26.280
NoriP: Balloons from all over the world...
Ai: Ah! Ah! This will soon be..

00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:29.220
Ai: My Youtuber career... Soon I..

00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:30.860
Ai: This is like something that was already seen!

00:20:30.860 --> 00:20:32.140
Ai: Give me a break, give me a break

00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:33.740
Ah!

00:20:34.180 --> 00:20:36.180
Ai: The two-turn attack just came..
NoriP: Oh!

00:20:36.180 --> 00:20:37.400
Ai: Nothing has changed... eh?

00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:38.360
Ai: It's so hard!

00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:39.200
Ai: Eh!?

00:20:39.340 --> 00:20:40.740
Ai: Please do your best!

00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:43.400
NoriP: This actually has an order in which you should defeat your ennemies...

00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:44.260
Ai: Ah!

00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:45.860
Ai: Right! Starting from the underlings..
NoriP: Yes

00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:48.760
Ai: I was really out of order..

00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:49.420
*laughs*

00:20:49.700 --> 00:20:51.160
NoriP: You tried to do the stronger one first..

00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:53.680
Ai: Right, right, I'm going to do it in the right order..

00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:55.840
NoriP: Then please keep on going..

00:20:56.560 --> 00:20:58.440
NoriP: Well, if you lose with this, it would be terrible!

00:20:58.440 --> 00:20:59.520
Ai: Yeah, that's right!

00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:02.680
Ai: After all I've tossed, only a fool would lose

00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:03.860
NoriP: That's why you're going to get passed

00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:07.840
NoriP: The uppers, you won't be made a Cryptract upper..

00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:10.320
Ai: Please!

00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:12.240
Ai: Don't push me!

00:21:12.300 --> 00:21:12.800
Ai: Ah, ah..

00:21:12.860 --> 00:21:14.860
Ai: His one attack is too much!

00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:16.520
Ai: Too much!

00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:18.700
Ai: Good, good, good!

00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:20.680
Ai: Aaaah...

00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:22.680
Ai: Aaah...

00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:24.460
Ai: Eh?

00:21:24.860 --> 00:21:25.900
Ai: Aha...

00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:27.580
Ai: Ah!?

00:21:28.180 --> 00:21:28.940
Ai: Aaaaah!?

00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:30.200
Ai: It's so strong!

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:31.660
Ai: Eh?

00:21:32.860 --> 00:21:34.860
Ai: But, with this...

00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:36.920
Ai: Eh?

00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:38.440
Ai: What?

00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:41.960
Ai: Wait, isn't it becoming stronger...?

00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:42.740
Ai: Wait a moment!

00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:44.420
Ai: Okay!

00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:46.500
Ai: Why do you do this!?

00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:47.700
NoriP: Eh?

00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:51.760
NoriP: We can't really see a lot with the fog..

00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:53.000
Ai: That's right..

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:55.280
Ai: Eh, what's written there? Win?

00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:57.060
NoriP: *laughs* Win's not written there, no..

00:21:57.060 --> 00:21:57.860
Ai: Hm?

00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:00.080
Ai: Ah?
NoriP: Ah?

00:22:00.180 --> 00:22:02.180
Ai: Yeah, the fog is really troubling..

00:22:02.180 --> 00:22:03.520
Ai: We couldn't understand what was going on there..

00:22:04.780 --> 00:22:05.920
NoriP: Ai-chan, wai-..

00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:08.920
NoriP: Cont... Conti... did you just used a continue?

00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:10.700
Ai: No, no continue!
Nori: No continue?

00:22:10.700 --> 00:22:11.840
Ai: The fog is just too big..

00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:13.080
Ai: The fog..

00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:13.920
NoriP: That's sly..

00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:15.620
Ai: It's mostly the fog's fault..

00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:16.480
NoriP: That aside..

00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:18.120
Ai: Mostly the fog..

00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:18.980
NoriP: Let's beat him!

00:22:18.980 --> 00:22:19.640
Ai: Let's do that!

00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:22.720
NoriP: Even if you used a continue, let's defeat him!

00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:24.260
Ai: HEY, YOU DON'T HAVE TO SAY I USED A CONTINUE!

00:22:24.340 --> 00:22:26.000
Ai: YOU DON'T HAVE TO SAY IT!

00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:27.700
NoriP: *laughs* Well, you'll get found out, so..

00:22:27.860 --> 00:22:30.340
Ai: If you don't say it, good kids won't understand it!

00:22:30.460 --> 00:22:31.060
*laughs*

00:22:31.300 --> 00:22:32.440
Ai: They don't understand!

00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:33.180
NoriP: Of course
Ai: Yes!

00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:36.240
Ai: Even if it's a lie, just keep lying..

00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:38.340
NoriP: It becomes real!
Ai: How was it called again? That's it!

00:22:38.340 --> 00:22:39.980
Ai: Ah! Ha! Please don't paralyze me!

00:22:40.820 --> 00:22:41.600
Ai: Aaah!

00:22:42.100 --> 00:22:43.440
Ai: Elizabeth-chan!

00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:44.380
Ai: No more..

00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:45.840
Ai:  You know..

00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:46.860
Ai: It's as if..

00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:49.520
Ai: If I wait, I can use very strong attacks, but...

00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:50.860
Ai: This paralysis...

00:22:50.860 --> 00:22:52.660
Ai: It makes them go "uzaza"..

00:22:54.180 --> 00:22:56.180
Ai: Ah, the fog is even bigger again..

00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:58.540
Ai: This makes me really upset!

00:22:58.540 --> 00:22:59.620
Ai: Can't anything be done about it?

00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:02.300
NoriP: If you're paralyzed..
Ai: Yes..

00:23:02.300 --> 00:23:03.780
NoriP: You can't use skills like that, so..

00:23:03.780 --> 00:23:04.720
Ai: Aaah!

00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:06.920
Ai: So, after all, the paralysis is...

00:23:07.940 --> 00:23:09.620
Ai: Better used on those who have skills?

00:23:09.860 --> 00:23:10.740
Ai: That's better..

00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:11.420
Ai: I see..

00:23:11.420 --> 00:23:11.920
Ai: Ah!

00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:14.460
Ai: This is nice! The timing is great!

00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:15.840
Ai: Yoi!

00:23:16.780 --> 00:23:17.880
Ai: Oh?
NoriP: Oh?

00:23:18.700 --> 00:23:19.680
Ai: Have mercy!

00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:25.540
Ai: Looks like... the fog will prevent us to see again..

00:23:25.540 --> 00:23:26.160
*laughs*

00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:27.080
Ai: Nice

00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:28.220
Ai: Do it more!

00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:31.140
Ai: It's like, if you watch anime..

00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:32.400
Ai: Sometimes...

00:23:32.980 --> 00:23:35.340
Ai: There's this kind of cloud or light, you know..
NoriP: Yes.. yes..

00:23:35.340 --> 00:23:35.840
NoriP: Yes

00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:37.280
Ai: I think that they're really disturbing!

00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:38.760
Ai: But now, they're pretty good!

00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:41.160
Ai: Aaaah, ha!

00:23:44.100 --> 00:23:45.340
Ai: I can do it, with this!

00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:47.660
NoriP: You can still do it!

00:23:48.100 --> 00:23:49.920
Ai: Gooood!

00:23:50.140 --> 00:23:51.880
Ai: Ahh, after all, it's really strong!

00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:53.360
Ai: What do you think?

00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:54.720
NoriP: A good thing happened!

00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:56.080
Ai: Without a continue, you know!

00:23:56.080 --> 00:23:56.740
NoriP: That was incredible!

00:23:56.740 --> 00:23:57.560
Ai: Incredible!

00:23:57.560 --> 00:23:59.000
NoriP: You won with 2 continues!

00:23:59.180 --> 00:24:00.100
Ai: AGAIN!?

00:24:00.100 --> 00:24:01.320
NoriP: *laughs*

00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:02.920
Ai: You don't need to say those kind of things!

00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:03.860
NoriP: I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:06.160
Ai: Your superiors didn't teach you about this!?

00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:07.260
NoriP: I'm sorry, I'm sorry

00:24:07.260 --> 00:24:08.100
Ai: Yes
NoriP: That's right!

00:24:08.100 --> 00:24:09.200
NoriP: No continue..

00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:10.480
Ai:  No con.. oh, this is cute! Eh?

00:24:10.660 --> 00:24:12.660
Ai: Foxes are cute!
NoriP: You got something..

00:24:12.940 --> 00:24:14.020
Ai: It's cute, pretty..

00:24:14.420 --> 00:24:15.220
Ai: Just now...

00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:17.300
Ai: It's so cute!
Nori: That's a Genju..

00:24:17.460 --> 00:24:20.040
Ai: It's hands are like "BASCON!"

00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:20.960
Ai: It's so cute!

00:24:22.340 --> 00:24:23.940
NoriP: Well, you got it as a reward..

00:24:23.940 --> 00:24:24.440
Ai: Yes

00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:25.500
NoriP: Isn't it worth it?

00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:26.660
Ai: Pretty much..

00:24:26.660 --> 00:24:27.480
Ai: How was it?

00:24:27.980 --> 00:24:29.480
NoriP: Well, you lost so...

00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:29.980
Ai: Eh!?

00:24:29.980 --> 00:24:31.320
Ai: Lost? It was a win!

00:24:31.340 --> 00:24:33.340
NoriP: No, well, you know...

00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:35.840
NoriP: Compared to when you started, you've really improved

00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:37.300
Ai: That's right!

00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:39.560
NoriP: At first, you were like...

00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:42.460
NoriP: You could only tap on it..
Ai: Yes, yes, yes..

00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:46.340
NoriP: But now, you know the skill specialities, timing and all that

00:24:46.700 --> 00:24:50.920
NoriP: Fighting while learning Genju's attributes..

00:24:51.420 --> 00:24:53.480
Ai: That's right!
Nori: I think you've become pretty good

00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:56.220
Ai: But, it's really where you should focus on

00:24:56.760 --> 00:24:57.860
Ai: You're really sharp!

00:24:58.820 --> 00:24:59.780
*laughs*

00:24:59.780 --> 00:25:00.620
Ai: It was without meaning to

00:25:01.180 --> 00:25:02.560
NoriP: It was on purpose, on purpose
Ai: It was without meaning to!

00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:03.620
Ai: How was it?

00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:04.740
NoriP: No...

00:25:04.740 --> 00:25:05.840
NoriP: Hmm...

00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:08.260
NoriP: There's still a lot of things that I would like to see...

00:25:08.380 --> 00:25:09.360
Ai: There's still some left!?

00:25:09.380 --> 00:25:11.580
NoriP: Until now, we did a lot of quizzes...

00:25:11.580 --> 00:25:13.540
NoriP: Or other tests to see your abilities..

00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:15.280
NoriP: Actually, like...

00:25:16.020 --> 00:25:18.560
NoriP: Showing what you've learnt, your results..

00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:20.200
NoriP: But not just that, luck as well..

00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:23.680
NoriP: I would like to see, like summonings!
Ai: It's part of your strength..

00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:24.180
Ai: Oh?!

00:25:24.180 --> 00:25:25.120
NoriP: We're going to watch that?

00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:26.020
Ai: Oh, this...

00:25:26.060 --> 00:25:28.820
Ai: If I draw outside of videos, I've had really bad luck..

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:30.060
NoriP: Ah, is that so?

00:25:30.260 --> 00:25:32.480
Ai: But when I'm recording, my luck is really good..

00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:33.620
NoriP: Isn't that a characteristic of a star?

00:25:33.620 --> 00:25:35.480
NoriP: You really have some lucky ones
Ai: Yes, I really do

00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:37.260
Ai: Right now..

00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:42.180
Ai: The chance boost is on Maidin-chan and Iris-chan..

00:25:42.520 --> 00:25:44.935
Ai: My targets are..

00:25:44.940 --> 00:25:47.040
Ai: This, Iris-chan..

00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:49.260
Ai: Semuhaza-chan?

00:25:49.260 --> 00:25:50.460
Ai: Semuhaza-san?

00:25:50.460 --> 00:25:51.080
Ai: Hm?

00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:53.540
Ai: Semuha...za...-chan?

00:25:53.540 --> 00:25:54.060
NoriP: Yes..

00:25:54.060 --> 00:25:54.860
Ai: Then..

00:25:54.860 --> 00:25:57.540
Ai: I already have Meiko-chan and Dorothy-chan too..

00:25:57.540 --> 00:25:58.040
NoriP: Yes

00:25:58.140 --> 00:26:00.820
Ai: This is cute, she has some dolls!

00:26:00.900 --> 00:26:03.420
NoriP: She's cute and she's strong! I got her!
Ai: Cute!

00:26:03.420 --> 00:26:04.400
Ai: Why do you have her?

00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:06.000
NoriP: *laughs* Because she appeared..

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.620
NoriP: Why, why you?
Ai: Damn directors, you upper dogs

00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:10.280
NoriP: No, no, no..
Ai: Wan!
(Japanese onomatopeia for dogs)

00:26:10.900 --> 00:26:13.000
Ai: You're an upper balloon
NoriP: Yes, I'm a balloon

00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:14.540
Ai: So, let's do this..
NoriP: Yes

00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:16.480
Ai: Come out!

00:26:16.860 --> 00:26:17.860
Ai: Girls!

00:26:17.965 --> 00:26:18.965
Ai: I like you, I love you!

00:26:19.220 --> 00:26:20.480
Ai: "Love you"!

00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:21.200
Ai: Ah...

00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:23.860
Ai: This looks a bit...

00:26:23.860 --> 00:26:25.500
NoriP: You can't really be sure, but...

00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:28.720
NoriP: Ah...

00:26:29.940 --> 00:26:32.440
...

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:34.200
Ai: AAAH!?
NoriP: Oh!?

00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:37.860
Ai: I really got lucky!

00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:41.960
Ai: Hey everyone, did you think I had failed? I really got this!

00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:43.140
Ai: She's so cute!

00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:46.480
Ai: Those stuffed toys around her are so cute!
NoriP: Twister!

00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:47.520
Ai: Are they some kind of stuffed toys?

00:26:47.580 --> 00:26:48.220
NoriP: Dorothy...

00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:49.680
Ai: She's so cute!
NoriP: Just as you called it

00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:51.220
Ai: Super cute!

00:26:51.220 --> 00:26:53.100
Ai: Dorothy is from a fairy tale? Right?

00:26:55.240 --> 00:26:56.700
NoriP: Woah, incredible, you really have some luck!

00:26:56.800 --> 00:26:58.720
Ai: Looks like I really have some good luck!

00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:00.460
NoriP: This is really great, isn't it?

00:27:00.460 --> 00:27:01.160
Ai: Ohoho!

00:27:01.220 --> 00:27:02.220
Ai: Eh!?

00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:03.460
Ai: Amazing!

00:27:03.980 --> 00:27:05.000
NoriP: Great luck!

00:27:05.300 --> 00:27:06.300
Ai: What do you think?

00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:08.240
Ai: Luck is the only thing I have!

00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:09.200
NoriP: *laughs*

00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:11.520
Ai: Only luck, only this!

00:27:11.540 --> 00:27:13.920
NoriP: Well, luck is all what you need

00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:15.080
Ai: Yaaay!

00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:15.580
Ai: Eh?

00:27:15.580 --> 00:27:17.180
NoriP: Let's team her up with your old team..

00:27:17.180 --> 00:27:17.900
Ai: Dorothy..

00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:20.320
Ai: Eh? Oh, I found her..

00:27:21.620 --> 00:27:23.080
Ai: She's really cute!

00:27:23.300 --> 00:27:23.800
Ai: Eh?

00:27:23.860 --> 00:27:24.760
Ai: This...

00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:27.540
Ai: I mean, Dorothy-chan herself is cute too, but..
NoriP: Yes!

00:27:27.540 --> 00:27:30.140
Ai: Those two things around her are so cute!

00:27:30.140 --> 00:27:31.260
NoriP: She attacks with them..

00:27:31.260 --> 00:27:31.780
Ai: Eh!?

00:27:32.140 --> 00:27:32.940
NoriP: If you tap on her..

00:27:32.940 --> 00:27:33.540
Ai: Ah!?

00:27:33.740 --> 00:27:35.520
Ai: It goes like "Shun"!
NoriP: Yes

00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:36.680
Ai: Ah, so cute!

00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:38.380
Ai: What about this little one?

00:27:38.380 --> 00:27:40.000
Ai: This one's already attacking..

00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:41.160
Ai: The other one protects her?

00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:44.240
Ai: Standby, alright, she's a decoration
NoriP: She's on standby..

00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:46.600
Ai: This girl so cute, like a mascot..
NoriP: *laughs*

00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:47.680
Ai: Ah... but...

00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:49.340
Ai: If I make a character..

00:27:49.340 --> 00:27:51.440
Ai: She will be like, I always wanted to be like this kind of girl..

00:27:51.540 --> 00:27:55.000
Ai: A girl with wings, a barrier, and stuffed toys!

00:27:55.480 --> 00:27:57.000
NoriP: Creating a character...

00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:58.780
NoriP: You really do want to make one..
Ai: Yes!

00:27:59.540 --> 00:28:00.380
NoriP: I see..

00:28:00.380 --> 00:28:01.880
Ai: I'll make one by myself and send it..

00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:02.700
*laughs*

00:28:02.780 --> 00:28:03.960
Ai: With a video..

00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:05.700
Ai: I'll create it and send it!

00:28:06.100 --> 00:28:08.620
Ai: And, if it's refused, I'm going to cry

00:28:09.140 --> 00:28:10.540
Ai: Even so, I can't get her, right?

00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:13.760
Ai: Eh... this girl can...

00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:17.420
Ai: Create a shield for all allies for 3x damage...

00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:19.980
Ai: Ah! She can make a barrier, nice!

00:28:20.660 --> 00:28:21.660
Ai: Also..

00:28:22.220 --> 00:28:25.180
Ai: It can hit 25 to 30 times, it's nice!

00:28:25.660 --> 00:28:28.000
Ai: What's the silence effect?

00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:31.060
Ai: It's when they can't do anything right?

00:28:31.060 --> 00:28:32.340
NoriP: Yes
Ai: Oh!
(Silence effect: Skills can't be used)

00:28:32.340 --> 00:28:34.960
Ai: That earlier one, it was floating..
NoriP: Yes, that was..

00:28:35.020 --> 00:28:38.800
Ai: If it is silenced, Reju... revive can't be used..
NoriP: Skill... skill... yes.

00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:40.680
NoriP: Yes, you can't use skills..
Ai: Oh! Perfect!

00:28:41.180 --> 00:28:42.540
Ai: Good timing!

00:28:42.540 --> 00:28:43.680
NoriP: Yeah
Ai: Nice!

00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:45.620
NoriP: Very powerful...
Ai: I really am..

00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:47.020
Ai: Furthermore..

00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:49.960
Ai: She's a Light type which I don't really have a lot..

00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:51.360
Ai: Yaah..

00:28:52.140 --> 00:28:53.560
Ai: So? I'm really powerful, aren't I?

00:28:53.560 --> 00:28:54.620
NoriP: Cryptract Quiz!

00:28:54.700 --> 00:28:55.200
Ai: Oh!?

00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:56.420
NoriP: All answers were correct

00:28:56.420 --> 00:28:58.620
NoriP: Physical test, was a big fail

00:28:58.820 --> 00:29:00.820
Ai: Physical test, was a big success!

00:29:01.180 --> 00:29:02.180
NoriP: Eh?
Ai: Eh?

00:29:03.060 --> 00:29:04.880
NoriP: But you used continues, didn't you?

00:29:04.940 --> 00:29:07.780
Ai: I only repeated what you've said..
NoriP: Oh really?

00:29:07.780 --> 00:29:08.280
Ai: Yes, yes, yes!

00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:08.780
NoriP: So..

00:29:08.820 --> 00:29:09.860
NoriP: Physical test..

00:29:09.860 --> 00:29:10.500
NoriP: Was a big failure..

00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:11.260
Ai: Was a big success..

00:29:12.100 --> 00:29:12.860
NoriP: Oh whatever...

00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:15.440
NoriP: But you were really strong with the summons!

00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:16.040
Ai: Great!

00:29:16.100 --> 00:29:18.420
Ai: If the end is good, everything is fine!

00:29:18.820 --> 00:29:19.880
NoriP: So your outcome is..

00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:20.420
Ai: Oh!

00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:21.800
NoriP: Still in Review!

00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:23.160
Ai: Ah!? Here it comes!

00:29:23.300 --> 00:29:26.580
Ai: Review... that's a really handy word..

00:29:26.940 --> 00:29:29.340
NoriP: Put it on review, NoriP doesn't really have the power..

00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:30.740
Ai: Oh, so who does...?

00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:32.800
Ai: Please bring someone who has authority!

00:29:33.140 --> 00:29:36.180
NoriP: Yes... well, it's a bit...

00:29:36.220 --> 00:29:37.960
NoriP: Hmmm....

00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:39.400
NoriP: NoriP is really powerless..

00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:41.540
Ai: Someone who has the power!
NoriP: This is useless, really

00:29:41.540 --> 00:29:42.040
Ai: Eh?

00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:44.180
NoriP: Asking a review for NoriP is useless

00:29:44.340 --> 00:29:47.500
Ai: Next time, bring someone who can make a real review..
NoriP: Yes, yes, yes...

00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:48.800
Ai: You know, to make it better..

00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:49.700
Ai: Better and better..

00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:51.940
Ai: Let's make it better..
NoriP: I'm doing it..

00:29:52.900 --> 00:29:53.620
Ai: Great!

00:29:53.700 --> 00:29:55.280
NoriP: It's just that...

00:29:55.280 --> 00:29:55.780
NoriP: Unique?

00:29:55.860 --> 00:30:00.980
NoriP: I'll tell my superiors, I definitely want to letthem know everything you've done for Cryptract
Ai: Yes, yes.. oh.. yes, yes

00:30:01.400 --> 00:30:02.000
NoriP: So then..

00:30:02.520 --> 00:30:04.280
NoriP: If you keep working hard..

00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:06.240
NoriP: That kind of thing can happen too..

00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:07.080
Ai: Oh! I see!
NoriP: Yes!

00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:09.460
Ai: So I just need to keep making these kind of videos?

00:30:09.460 --> 00:30:12.320
Ai: Well, I'm already doing it, I'm already doing it..
NoriP: You're already doing it, right?

00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:13.340
Ai: They're done, right?

00:30:13.340 --> 00:30:14.300
NoriP: They've been done, yeah

00:30:14.300 --> 00:30:14.900
Ai: Then..

00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:18.120
AI: Additionally, I'm thinking about a supportive song!

00:30:18.660 --> 00:30:21.380
Ai: You know, I kind of want to make one, what do you think?

00:30:21.380 --> 00:30:23.620
NoriP: You will create a song for Cryptract?

00:30:23.620 --> 00:30:24.960
Ai: Yes, just for Cryptract!

00:30:24.980 --> 00:30:26.000
NoriP: That would be appreciated!

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:26.500
Ai: Oh?

00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:28.920
Ai: Right? Isn't it!?
NoriP: Yes, yes

00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:31.980
Ai: I will, myself, compose this supportive song..

00:30:31.980 --> 00:30:35.220
NoriP: That sounds nice, I'm very happy for your support
Ai: Yes! Yes!

00:30:35.220 --> 00:30:37.320
NoriP: It makes me quite curious..

00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:40.520
Ai: Yes it is, count on me!
NoriP: Yes, yes, yes, I want your support

00:30:41.060 --> 00:30:42.860
NoriP: Then I'll report about this too

00:30:42.860 --> 00:30:43.420
Ai: Yes!

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.060
Ai: With this.. it's perfect
NoriP: Those uppers..

00:30:46.220 --> 00:30:47.380
Ai: It feels like "Ga, ha, ha"!

00:30:47.660 --> 00:30:49.420
NoriP: *laughs* It really does!

00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:52.720
Ai: Yes, thank you very much for today!

00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:53.620
NoriP: Thank you very much!

00:30:53.620 --> 00:30:54.680
Ai: Well, next time..

00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:57.220
Ai: Bring someone from the uppers

00:30:57.220 --> 00:30:58.300
NoriP: Yes, the uppers..

00:30:58.300 --> 00:31:00.080
Ai: Then, next is, even more higher people..

00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:01.360
NoriP: Yes, even higher...

00:31:01.380 --> 00:31:02.460
Ai: And next..

00:31:02.500 --> 00:31:05.440
Ai: Bring some even more higher than higher people!

00:31:05.560 --> 00:31:07.640
NoriP: Right, then I'm not necessary, right?

00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:08.220
Ai: No!

00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:10.720
Ai: No, it's not like that, it's not like that..

00:31:10.780 --> 00:31:11.280
*laughs*

00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:13.840
NoriP: No, no, no, no, no..
Ai: You can just fly around..

00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:14.740
NoriP: I could never do that..

00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:18.760
Ai: With that being said, let's be hyped for the supportive song!

00:31:19.580 --> 00:31:21.280
Ai: Please wait anxiously for the next one!

00:31:21.700 --> 00:31:24.700
Ai: So then, this was Virtual Youtuber Kizuna Ai!

00:31:24.760 --> 00:31:25.760
Ai: See you later!
