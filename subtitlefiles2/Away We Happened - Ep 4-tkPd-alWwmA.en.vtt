00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:19.860
Sir! Sir, are you all right?

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.280
Oh!  Yeah. You guys just have really... clean doors, so...

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:26.480
I'm just going to go sit down.

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:46.800
Jean!

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:48.300
Hey, Jean!

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:49.080
I'm, I'm inside!

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:51.840
But...you can't hear me,

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.200
so I'm just gonna... just gonna stop talking...

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:07.960
Are you OK?

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.960
That was so embarrassing! Do you think anyone saw that?

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.840
No! No one saw.

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.880
Well, except for maybe all those people laughing over there.

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:20.880
Here's some ice for your forehead.

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.000
[simultaneously] Oh, I'm OK.

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.740
They have really clean doors!

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:30.240
I know, right!

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:35.640
Definitely NOT how I imagined our first time... officially meeting.

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.020
Well... what was it it supposed to be like?

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:43.540
I don't know, a little more... charming and smooth and a little less... running into doors?

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.960
Oh! Anyway, here's your bag.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.100
Oh!  Yeah, here's yours.

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:53.860
What is that!?

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:56.320
You don't recognise him? It's Edgar!

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.980
Well, he did put on a little bit of weight since he's been with me,

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:04.300
but I try not to bring it up because... it's a touchy subject.

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.520
I love it! He's even cuter now.

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.480
And now no one will 'accidentally' take your bag again.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.120
Thanks, Daniel!

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:21.960
(acoustic music)

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:26.100
Oh! Hold on...

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.860
No, no. It's good, it's good.

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.260
Wow, it's 3 already!

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.040
You in a rush?

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.860
Hot date?

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:41.260
Huh, no!

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:42.600
Ugly date?

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.880
No date,

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.540
I just have some writing I have to get done.

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.700
Oh, yeah me too! I gotta go do some work, so...

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.180
Alright, well, I guess I should-

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.140
You should... You should come with me!

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.460
I want to show you something.

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.720
(acoustic music)

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:33.680
I might get the job out here.

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:36.740
You deserve it.

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:39.700
You're a great writer.

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.720
I read your notebook, so...

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:48.960
But I'd have to move to L.A.

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:53.940
Have you ever thought of living out here?

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:56.380
I tried it once...

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:00.140
...but there wasn't much for me here.

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:03.200
Everything I know is in New York.

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:05.400
...Oh.

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:10.100
But...

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:15.060
I think I found a reason to give it another try.

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:36.680
So, you sure you got everything?

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:37.580
Yeah.

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:39.520
You sure that one's mine?

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:41.120
Postive!

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:46.060
Well, it was nice to meet you... again.

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:50.920
So, will I be seeing you before I fly back?

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:52.720
Yeah,

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:53.660
I'd like that.

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:12.420
(sighs)

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:17.680
(acoustic music)

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:31.780
(letter) Hey, Jeremy.

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:35.800
I know it's been a while since we last spoke, but

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:38.640
I guess I feel like I had to say...

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:39.620
...something.

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:45.420
I still think about how things were left off between us, and...

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:47.520
...I wish it didn't happen the way that it did.

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:50.740
I'm going to be in LA for a little while and I thought...

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:54.520
...maybe there'd be a chance to give us another try?
