00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:01.340
Hi everyone,

00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:03.520
I'm the Virtual Youtuber Kizuna Ai.

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:06.580
This time, I think I want to learn about business etiquette

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.100
There was a time when I lost my job,

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:14.600
From the start, I wonder if I can say being Youtuber is my job,

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:15.460
But still...

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:18.460
I think it a good thing to learn about business ethics.

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:19.840
"Do you want to appear in a commercial?"

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:22.300
If a high position person offered me that

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:24.200
We wouldn't want to be rude, right?

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.200
With that in mind, I Kizuna Ai...

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:29.700
will try to learn about business manner.

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:31.600
Lesson 1

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.060
"When exchanging business cards"

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.240
In business society, exchanging business cards is inevitable.

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.720
The most important thing during a business card exchange is...

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.260
Height of your business card when exchanging cards!

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.480
If someone has a higher position,

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:46.740
let them introduce first.

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.880
And then,

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.620
Do not take their until they receive my business card first.

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:52.060
Did everyone know?

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.040
With an exception,

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.180
There will be a problem here.

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.420
For example,  a situation when both party doesn't know the position of the other person.

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.140
If they think they're inferior than the other,...

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.420
That's how the business card exchange begin.

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.540
It's to fight. (determine who's first)

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.100
Well, it's fast if you see it for yourself.

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.900
I'll demonstrate it to you.

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:10.640
"Business Card Exchange" START!

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.540
Isn't it great that today is sunny?

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.460
The air is also great!

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:17.900
Ahh, thank you for always taking care of me.

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:19.580
It is alright if we do exchange our business card?

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.140
Ah, thank you so much.

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.820
I am the super intelligent A.I.

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.460
and I work as Virtual Youtuber,

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.000
go by the name of Ai Kizuna.

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.280
Ah, no no...ah

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:29.500
Eh, here 's my card

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:30.780
Oh, no no no, it's okay!

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:32.580
No no no,

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:33.760
please, go ahead.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:34.580
Please...

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.140
Ah, I got on the floor..

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:37.080
It's amazing!

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:38.320
Ah, please accept this.

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.060
I beg you to please accept this.

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.060
Do you understand it now?

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:44.460
Moving on to the next thing.

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:45.900
Lesson 2

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:46.980
"When toasting"

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.140
Just like with the business card exchange before,

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.600
we learned about higher position and lower position.

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.400
When toasting, we also let's the higher toast first. It's the manner to do so.

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:57.900
Then let's test it out!

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:59.180
"Toasting" START!

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.840
"Uhm, everyone! This season's profit

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.840
shows that we're the highest earning company!"

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.640
"You all did a great job.

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:06.440
And also from now on,

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:07.740
To the future of our company,

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.000
Cheers!!"

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:10.940
Cheers!!

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.560
As expected of our president!

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.120
It's all thanks to your management policies

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.740
Would it be okay if we toast our glasses?

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:20.680
Cheers!!

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.600
Ah, don't do that please.

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.580
No no no no, please.

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.580
I can't go any lower, president.

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:28.820
Its looking good.

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:32.180
This time our toast with the president's was slightly weird but

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.700
But ethically-speaking the lower ranking employee must go lower so it's probably right.

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.840
Let's move on to the next mannerism.

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:39.480
Lesson 3

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.480
"When pouring beer into a glass"

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.380
This is also useful for drinks with your company.

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.380
This time, as I show you

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.380
I'll explain what am I doing to you.

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:49.780
So let's go on with the lesson.

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:51.240
President~

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:52.700
Do you want some beer?

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.520
First of all you need to ask them about it.

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:56.420
So let's proceed!

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.900
Our improving results

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.300
was thanks to your policy!

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:02.600
This part is important:

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:03.920
The beer bottle's

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:05.920
label should face up when you hold the bottle

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.340
and let's avoid the bottle and the glass touching!

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.340
So we'd get nice foams on it,

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:13.180
pour the beer little by little into the glass by lifting the beer higher.

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.360
Look at the foam rising!
Whoops!

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:17.540
Do you get it?

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:20.080
Until now, when dealing with higher-ups

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.480
It's proper ethique to be lower but

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.820
For this reason, there's no lowering down!

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:26.400
Go up for the foams!

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.960
Let's try it out!

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.440
Whoooooo! It looks good!

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.200
Take a look at it, president!

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.420
The foam is overflowing! Hurry up and drink it!

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.300
You're doing great, president!

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.580
How is your beer, president? It looks great!

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:42.620
It's world record!

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:44.620
You'll be on Guinness Book of Records!

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:46.860
That concludes our Business Ethics lesson.

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:48.340
Lastly,

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:51.000
I want to tell you this just once:

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.300
For all of you entering work society,

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:55.840
DON'T TRY WHAT TOLD YOU IN THIS VIDEO!

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:58.640
I won't take any responsibility!

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:01.480
With that out of the way, do your best at work tomorrow too, okay?

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:02.660
Bye bye!

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:16.380
[10/10 would get fired for making world record beer foams]
