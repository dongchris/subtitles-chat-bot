00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:02.733
Hello, everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna AI here!

00:00:02.733 --> 00:00:03.450
Man~

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:06.066
When I look at everyone, what I really think is

00:00:06.066 --> 00:00:07.400
Everyone is tired!

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:08.800
There are lots of tired people!

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:09.366
Well, if everyday

00:00:09.366 --> 00:00:11.166
You see a beautiful girl like me

00:00:11.166 --> 00:00:13.100
I’m sure you can be healed, but

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.600
But!

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:14.900
Not just the heart!

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.100
I want to heal your mind and body together!

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:17.566
That's right!

00:00:17.566 --> 00:00:18.366
And with that

00:00:18.366 --> 00:00:20.300
How about we do yoga!?

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:21.233
Is what I’m thinking

00:00:21.233 --> 00:00:22.066
A beautiful girl...

00:00:22.066 --> 00:00:23.120
Doing yoga...

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:24.100
With a beautiful girl...

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:24.433
This...

00:00:24.433 --> 00:00:25.600
Is the best, right?

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:26.433
And with that

00:00:26.433 --> 00:00:27.333
Though it’s been a while

00:00:27.333 --> 00:00:29.866
Let’s give yoga a shot!

00:00:29.866 --> 00:00:32.533
This time we’re gonna be trying some awesome poses, so...

00:00:32.533 --> 00:00:33.000
Everyone

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.866
Follow me to the end!

00:00:34.866 --> 00:00:36.300
A.I.Channel

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.666
Everyone, thank you for your hard work today

00:00:38.666 --> 00:00:39.733
Together with me

00:00:39.733 --> 00:00:40.766

And touch the sole to your thigh

00:00:46.066 --> 00:00:46.960
Then...

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.100
Raise both hands above your head

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.666
And stare at a single point

00:00:50.666 --> 00:00:52.220
Empty your heart

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:54.130
And breathe slowly with your abdomen

00:01:03.833 --> 00:01:05.080
On the other side, too

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:06.133
The same as before

00:01:06.133 --> 00:01:07.233
Touch the inside of your thigh

00:01:07.233 --> 00:01:07.950

Raise both hands above your head

00:01:10.433 --> 00:01:12.100
And while starting at a single point

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:13.300
Breathe with your abdomen

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.233

00:01:27.833 --> 00:01:29.720
Lift your knees off the floor

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:30.900
And raise your butt

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.100
When you’re like this

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:32.630
Take your arms

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.033
And make a straight line with your back

00:01:36.033 --> 00:01:38.700
Breathe slowly with your abdomen

00:01:47.566 --> 00:01:48.480
Everyone

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.500
Did you make it this far?

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.600
Well then, it’s time for the last pose

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.250
Don’t forget to keep

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:55.700
A calm heart and remain

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.466
In a relaxed condition

00:01:57.466 --> 00:01:58.833

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:16.640
Breathe with your abdomen

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.670
The point of this

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.970
Is to get your body parallel with the ground

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.070
It’s pretty tough, huh?

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:24.420

Go for it!

00:02:27.633 --> 00:02:28.166
Keep going!

00:02:28.166 --> 00:02:29.433
As for abdominal breathing, only

00:02:29.433 --> 00:02:29.933
Two more times!

00:02:29.933 --> 00:02:31.000
Go for it!

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.066
You can do it!

00:02:32.066 --> 00:02:33.340
Hwoooo...

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:34.820

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:40.240
Eh?
[ You’re not doing yoga? ]

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:41.210
[ You’re not doing yoga? ]

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:42.550
Yeah, but I’m a lecturer?
[ You’re not doing yoga? ]

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.933
[ You’re not doing yoga? ]

00:02:42.933 --> 00:02:44.633
On the other side, in the same way

00:02:44.633 --> 00:02:45.510
Take ahold of your foot

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:46.333
Stand on one leg

00:02:46.333 --> 00:02:47.570
And while breathing in

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:48.610
Raise your arm above you

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:50.333
Then...

00:02:50.333 --> 00:02:51.750
While breathing out

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:52.900
Lean forward

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:55.466
Keep your body and the floor

00:02:55.466 --> 00:02:56.470
Parallel!

00:02:56.833 --> 00:02:58.530
Abdominal breathing...

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:11.500
Ah, I think I can do it this time

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:23.766
How was that?

00:03:23.766 --> 00:03:25.933
Well, I was perfectly composed, but...

00:03:25.933 --> 00:03:27.020
You were able to

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:28.233
Follow along properly, right?

00:03:28.233 --> 00:03:30.400
When you get tired of your everyday life

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.200
Please come watch this video!

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:33.666
