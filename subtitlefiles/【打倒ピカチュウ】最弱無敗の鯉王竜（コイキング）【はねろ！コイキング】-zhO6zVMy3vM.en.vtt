00:00:00.525 --> 00:00:03.245
Hello everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai here!

00:00:03.305 --> 00:00:08.135
Lately I’ve felt a lot of affinity with a character!

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:09.960
That character is the following!

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:12.080
Magikarp!

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.380
Magikarp is great! Right?

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:18.680
In Pokemon Snap, I couldn't take a good photo of it, but...

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:23.100
...Being so weak, he works with all of his strength to jump

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:27.280
And for me, who's working really hard while being in this white space

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:28.840
I feel sympathy for him!

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:30.160
I respect it a lot!

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.460
Having said that, in this occasion...

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:33.980
"Magikarp Jump"

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:36.020
I plan to play the game called this way

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.220
I'll be a Pokemon Master with Magikarp!

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:45.040
With the help of Magikarp, we'll both crush Pikachu, the infamous Pokemon

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.060
In that case, here I go!

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:47.400
Magikarp-tan!

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.480
Come here, man, you're adorable

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.920
Ah, man, you’re really adorable

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:55.780
This little one is my partner

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:57.900
Man, I like it a lot

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:02.760
Good, let's get stronger together, we’ll jump a lot and do our very best, yes?

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.660
We will laugh at those who make fun of us!

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.000
Eh? It’s adorable, right?

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.840
It's long mustaches are adorable, right?

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.100
Good, in that case, let's do a special training? Here I go!

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:14.020
Yes!

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:19.320
Very good!

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:31.400
(Hums "The Magikarp Song")

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.580
Man... it’s surreal

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:35.660
Eeeh? Incredible!

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.920
Hey! Hey! Hey! Didn't I reach the maximum it could count?

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:40.880
There's a lot of "9’s”

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.435
Resounding success! Ah, there’s a lot, right?

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:45.780
Eh? A lot of combat points went up!
(Combat Points in JP/ Jump Points in ENG)

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:47.620
Eh? It's incredible, right?

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.620
It's definitely thanks to... the power of my song?

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.080
"Listen to my song!" or something like that

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.100
Eh? Someone's getting close?

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.100
Hmm...?

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:01.200
"After a special training..."
*After a special training, an event can happen randomly*

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.340
Oooh! An event!
*After a special training, an event can happen randomly*

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.800
*Event: Mayor's massage*

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.440
Do I get a massage?

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.520
*Mayor Karp: Did you just finish a special training? Your Magikarp appears tired*

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.520
Ah, it's true, it's tired, right?

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.020
Even the scales are coming off

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:13.040
*Mayor Karp: Let me see, leave it to me, I’ll give it a special massage... Urya!*

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.580
"Leave it..." Oh! A massage!
*Mayor Karp: Let me see, leave it to me, I’ll give it a special massage... Urya!*

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:15.960
You’ll do a massage to a fish?

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.400
Ah! When it gets a massage, it recovers, right?

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.480
Look! Look! It leveled up a lot!

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:27.560
Incredible!

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:29.360
Listen, in fact...

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.940
Ah
*Magikarp’s body has reached medium size*

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:30.620
*Magikarp’s body has reached medium size*

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.120
It’s body grew! Right?
*Magikarp’s body has reached medium size*

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:34.720
But it says “Rank 1”

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:37.280
"Even bigger..."

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.860
"When CP reachws over 1000..."
Ah, ah... 1k, like it said before, right?

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.420
Eh? It got very big!

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.280
Man, it got a lot stronger!

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.220
Mama is so happy...! Eh? Are there Pokeballs?

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:50.820
Ah, they give you coins

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:58.860
Man, you’ve grown in such a marvelous way, mama is really happy, really…

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.560
Eh? Isn’t it growing really well?

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:03.700
Good! Let's go to the special training

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:04.860
Ah, but, wait...

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:10.420
I already trained a lot, I want to try to go to the League and see up to where I can get

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:13.540
Last time, I reached up to 6 meters?

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:15.460
I’m quite sure that I can do it

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:22.160
You shouldn't hold back because your opponent is a female Magikarp

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:25.480
You take it on your arms!

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.420
It's adorable, it jumps energetically

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:31.900
Let's go forward! Ah, they have almost the same size

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:35.240
I can do it!

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:38.700
Jump! Magikarp!

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:43.320
How did I do? How did I do?

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:45.600
Man! It's a piece of cake! Right?

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.140
When they fall and go through the ground, it's really...

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:52.980
I did it! Oh, ten...! Ah!

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:55.380
...I did it around 3 times higher than last time

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:56.160
Incredible!

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.980
With this level, can’t I do the third round easily?

00:03:58.980 --> 00:03:59.560
Ah!

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:02.800
Pikachu is waiting for me in the fifth round

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.680
Wait for me, I’ll finish you off!

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:10.840
Jump! Magikarp!

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:12.620
How did I do? How did I do? How did I do?

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:13.500
Ah!

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:15.800
Isn’t this too easy?

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.160
I expected nothing less of my Magikarp-chan

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:21.820
Man, it’s very easy, right?

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:23.700
I wonder if I can even pass the fourth round

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:24.440
I’ll go...

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:26.900
...And then train a bit more...

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.900
And finally I’ll finish Pikachu off completely!

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.680
Jump! Magikarp!

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:37.900
Ah! It's a piece of cake, right?

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:40.720
Eh? Ah! Aah!

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:41.920
Eh? Are you okay?

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:44.220
I knew it

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:47.800
In that case, I’ll make it eat more of this food that accumulated a lot here

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:51.200
And then I’ll go to a special training at once...

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:53.300
...And then I’ll go defeat Pikachu ♪

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:54.220
“Special Training"

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:58.480
Sand bags?

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:00.740
How are you supposed to...? What are you doing?

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:05.120
Really, why are you doing something like that to Magikarp?

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:06.840
It's unreal

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:09.240
It's jumping with all of its strength

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:10.980
He care for him a lot, right?

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:11.780
How adorable

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:15.800
Oh! Success!

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:18.920
Ah, but...

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:21.780
...It’s completely different to "Resounding victory", right?

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:24.300
It looks like I had a lot of luck last time

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:28.020
Oh! It leveled up! Yay!

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:29.460
Ah, Didn’t it reach the maximum level? Eh?

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:30.440
The level didn’t go up

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:33.740
I think I got up to level 12 before

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:35.500
What do you think? What do you think?

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:37.640
I leveled it up until it reached the maximum level

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:39.760
*Mayor Karp: At its current state, it can't raise 
 it's jump power any further*

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:40.980
Eh? That’s all?
*Mayor Karp: At its current state, it can't raise 
 it's jump power any further*

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:42.620
*Mayor Karp: For this Magikarp, this is its final League*

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:43.860
Ah, so then that's it? Eh?
*Mayor Karp: For this Magikarp, this is its final League*

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:45.080
Do I have to say goodbye to it...? Eh?

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:46.640
Do I have to say goodbye? Eh?

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:48.800
Is that what it referred to with the first generation? Eh?

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:51.560
*Mayor Karp: Try to get as far as you don’t leave any regrets!*

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:52.380
Eh?

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:54.080
What does that...?

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:57.040
What happens once it reaches the furthest it can go?

00:05:58.060 --> 00:05:59.760
Do we need to say goodbye?

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:01.260
*Retirement: You reached the maximum level, so then Magikarp can’t grow any further*

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.300
"Retirement"
*Retirement: You reached the maximum level, so you can't make Magikarp can’t grow any further*

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:05.260
"So you can’t make Magikarp grow any further"
*Being at its best state, it should retire! Let's do the last challenge!*

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:06.700
*Being at its best state, it should retire! Let's do the last challenge!*

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:07.840
Eeeeehhh?

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:10.260
Eh? Just when we’re about to defeat Pikachu!

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:12.560
Now it should retire?

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:15.140
I'll work hard in feeding it

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:18.020
We’ll both work hard together in the special training

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:23.040
The Magikarp that brought together so much perspiration, tears and young vigor

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:25.060
It needs to retire?

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:30.800
Ah, but this is the inevitable destiny, right?

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:33.500
It's sad but there's nothing more that I can do, right?

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:37.480
Eh? My opponent is a Magikarp... Ah!

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:40.120
Maybe Pikachu will appear once we defeat this Magikarp?

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:41.620
Magikarp...

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:43.980
It's sad but... let's do our best!

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:51.300
I'll make sure that you win!

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:00.380
I won't forget you

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:05.620
Eh? I don’t want to say goodbye to it! I don't care they can't keep leveling up!

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:07.340
Let's stay together...

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:10.440
Let's stay together this way, Magikarp

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:11.640
*Do your best!*

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:14.540
Of course I'll do my best, after all this is the fight for its retirement

00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:18.140
Eeeeehhhhh?

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:19.720
Hmm...

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:20.940
One, two and...

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:21.960
Jump!

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:23.900
Magikarp!

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:29.640
What a relief! Ah! I won!

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:35.000
I did it!

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:37.740
We’ve won, Magikarp!

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:40.880
Hmm... We won, but...

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:43.080
Do I have to say goodbye to it now?

00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:47.100
No, but not until we defeat Pikachu...

00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:51.020
...Our ambition won't be fulfilled, right?

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:52.540
Eh? Eh?

00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:55.160
Eeeehh?

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:56.720
Eh? It can't be, eh?

00:07:57.460 --> 00:08:01.140
Ah, it's not that, what a relief, what a relief, I thought we had to be separated

00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:03.280
Hurray, I won! I did it!

00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:06.280
*Exp +2*

00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:07.380
I did it!

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:08.680
I won!

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:11.440
"Friend medal recieved!"

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.120
Ah, you gain medals, I see

00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:17.580
Yay!

00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:20.520
"Congratulatioins! Friend League Champion"
"A commemorative photo has been stored in the album"

00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:22.400
"Got 6 coins!"
"Got 25 diamonds!"

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:23.880
I've gotten coins and diamonds!

00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:26.160
"Recieved Light Ball-" Hm?

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:27.940
Wait, aren't we going to defeat Pikachu?

00:08:31.715 --> 00:08:33.555
"Received Light Ball!"

00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:37.220
Hey, it's Pikachu

00:08:37.540 --> 00:08:38.880
"Pikachu has come to the fish pond"

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:42.220
Pikachu has... Pikachu has... Pikachu has...

00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:42.860
Huh?

00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:44.220
Pika- Huh? Pika-

00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:46.800
"This was his last match, Magikarp will retire!"

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:47.900
What!? No, no, no, no!!

00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:49.760
Retirement!? No, no, no!

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:52.060
Eh? No! NO!

00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:55.420
No, I don't like this, is he going to retire?

00:08:56.905 --> 00:08:57.905
Noo!

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:02.700
Why must you make us separate the two of us?

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:05.740
Is this farewell?

00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:10.120
I actually don't like this

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:13.455
Don't, like, label him "1st Generation"...

00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:16.380
The only real Magikarp to me is this one

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:19.620
Nooo, this is actually like-

00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:22.240
I don't want this, please stop?

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:24.860
If I win another, is that it?

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:27.240
I'm sad...

00:09:27.335 --> 00:09:28.335
But!

00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:32.500
I won't forget the medals we won together

00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:34.800
And I won't forget you either...

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:38.920
"Generation change"? Why...

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:40.420
"Well done!"

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:43.400
"By growing your Magikarp to its limits, it seems you yourself has also grown a lot"

00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:45.095
I guess that's right, master

00:09:45.095 --> 00:09:48.275
My heart has... grown... a lot!

00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:52.760
I guess with hard separations, people can grow

00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:57.900
I can't really imagine a new one right now...

00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:04.120
"Scale patterns you can fish"

00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:06.740
Huh, they've different patterns

00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:10.060
But no matter what pattern it is...

00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:11.640
"I've prepared some lively Magikarp! Choose a fishish rod"

00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:13.400
My Magikarp...

00:10:14.795 --> 00:10:15.815
Can only be that one

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:19.300
These are all "tattered"! They're the same!

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:28.060
You can't easily catch one better than my Magikarp...

00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:37.520
Wow!! Look at this, it has an amazing pattern!

00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:39.720
What a lovely Magikarp!

00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:41.320
"It appears to have a some individuality"

00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:43.980
Yeah, it seems to have some white patterns, doesn't it?

00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:47.020
Hmm? Isn't this much better than the previous one?

00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:48.180
I choose you!

00:10:48.985 --> 00:10:52.015
Oh, name? "Magikarp" is fine, "Magikarp"

00:10:52.775 --> 00:10:53.775
Hmm?

00:10:55.255 --> 00:10:56.255
It's so small *laughs*

00:10:57.540 --> 00:11:01.000
I wonder if they're conversing, like "I leave Ai-chan to you" or something

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.840
Don't worry Magikarp

00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:06.460
I'll get along just fine with the new Magikarp

00:11:07.825 --> 00:11:09.135
So you sleep there

00:11:11.315 --> 00:11:13.365
Oh, he watches over me!

00:11:14.845 --> 00:11:16.095
So kind!

00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:17.780
See ya!

00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:20.980
Eh, there's a Pikachu

00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:23.600
Eh?

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:26.500
Hold on

00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:31.520
We don't fight?

00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:33.000
Pokemon...

00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:34.780
Pikachu...

00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:36.740
That means...

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:38.500
He's a support Pokemon?

00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:40.400
He helps with training?

00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:47.180
What? What does that mean? By any chance...

00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:49.400
Pikachu...

00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:51.780
Are you...

00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:54.700
Supporting...

00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:56.860
Us..?

00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:02.080
He gave me CP!

00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:04.380
And...

00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:05.500
Like, look

00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:12.120
He's blinking his eyes and he’s watching over us with a kind gaze

00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:15.320
What a kind child...!!

00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:18.300
I've woken up

00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:20.680
My feelings of yearning towards the infamous Pikachu

00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:23.455
Was showing itself as ugly jealousy

00:12:23.460 --> 00:12:27.200
For saying inappropriate things such as "crush Pikachu"...

00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:30.120
Alongside with Magikarp, I would like to apologize!

00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:32.320
I'm truly sorry!

00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:36.675
"One must not forget their beginning humility"

00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:39.360
Kizuna Ai learnt this teaching

00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:42.800
Through "Leap! Magikarp"

00:12:43.475 --> 00:12:45.435
While remembering these words every day

00:12:45.435 --> 00:12:48.465
She will strive further onward

00:12:48.855 --> 00:12:52.195
You're amazing Magikarp! Thank you Magikarp!

00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:56.520
