00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:01.040
Hi there~

00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:02.980
I'm the Virtual Youtuber - Kizuna Ai.

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:04.600
A little while ago

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:07.440
I uploaded a video testing my kanji skills right?

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.260
"Ai-chan's English language plugin's not installed, isn't that bad?"

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:12.900
-Is what you said!

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:14.640
What's with that rude-

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:15.440
What's with that rude- or not.

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:17.160
Well it's the truth, you're not wrong.

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:18.400
Just that..

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:19.100
You see..

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:20.400
My English really is-

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:21.440
-bad.

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:23.080
If I can practice more English,

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.560
"More communication with people from all sorts of countries-

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:26.600
-could be done!"

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.300
Is what I keep thinking.

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:29.360
More of that..

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:33.060
Comments along with tweets, all this communication, I want to be able to receive it well!

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.400
So this time around

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.160
I'll be studying other languages.

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.120
First, English's study-

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:39.480
-is what I think I'll do.

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:40.800
I title it -

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.380
*text reads*
First session
Kizuna Ai's
English Study

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.260
If you wish to learn English this way as well,

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:48.900
-then let's work hard together!

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.360
Then let's go~

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:55.100
This time we'll be using Duolingo's services,

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.600
*text reads*
Enjoyable foreign language learning service
「Duolingo」

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.120
to study together!

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:59.440
How to say this..

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:03.740
It's a service that lets you feel like you're playing a game while learning the language at the same time!

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.020
Isn't it great?

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:06.360
Suits me perfectly.

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.240
It's got Apple's "App of the Year".

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:10.040
And,

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.480
Google Play's "Best of the Best"

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:15.280
Each of the awards given due to it being a popularly endorsed service!

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.120
Not only does it provide its own website,

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.580
-there's also the iPhone/Android version!

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:21.280
Which is why for this video,

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:23.340
we're using the app version of it!

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.980
Now, I want to quickly start with it but..

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:27.820
"Are you a beginner?"

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:29.480
- Is the question written there.

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:32.320
Well of course! For me - the global super A.I.

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.720
It'll be have to be the "Intermediate/Advanced" right?

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.040
I'll nail the simple 5-minutes test.

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:42.900
Please translate this sentence.
(I'll just put in the meaning word by word)

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:48.420
They..

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:50.780
Have..

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:52.340
Water..

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:52.940
O - continuation letter for a subject 'water'
*typed as 'wo' on a romaji keyboard*

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:53.820
Drink it..

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.100
They...

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:57.820
Wait..

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:59.820
It might not be "her".

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.820
Uhm.. so..

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:01.660
Just like this!

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.420
I really don't have the English plugin.

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.180
Uhm...

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.880
Ducks..

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:14.400
The ducks..

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.940
Those..

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:17.300
Ducks..

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.020
"Ducks" is 'Kamo' right?

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.020
There's 2 'ducks'..

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.620
Those..

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:25.140
Duck..

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:26.700
Ah I understand now!

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.080
Those ducks are my ducks!

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.580
*No misdirection in translation*

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.880
See that?

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:35.000
See that?

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:37.160
I did it~

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.300
Please translate the following sentence!

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.680
"He loves you."

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.180
What's 「彼」(kare) in English again?

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.800
They.. (or there)?
*I can't tell*

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.620
Like this..

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:50.060
It kinda goes like this?
*Absolutely wrong lolol*

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.940
Space..

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:55.000
Is..

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.440
I wonder what's 「あなた」(you) in English again?

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.740
You!

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:02.560
You..

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:04.180
「あなた」- means "you" in English. A more polite word to use in Japan than e.g.「お前」(omae)

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.920
Oh..

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:08.200
You..

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.940
For..

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:12.620
Fo...

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.260
Falling..

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:18.780
Falling... *giggles*

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:20.260
Fall..

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.900
Eh?

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:25.740
Ling-gu?

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:29.300
Love! 
*silent*

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:32.660
Ok Perfect!

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.520
Eh-zen..

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:35.940
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT!

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:37.360
Ah! 'He'?

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.000
Heee lafuuzuu yuu~
*sorry I had to*

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:40.260
Simple!

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:41.620
Eh~?!

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.260
I thought a little bit too hard yes?

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:45.700
I knew it it's because of that..

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:47.220
My processing speed's too fast.

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.040

Please insert what you hear.

Now...

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:56.840
The..

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:03.160
The... dog... is... ours...

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:03.920
The..

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:05.260
Dog..

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:10.780
Is..

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:12.080
What was the last one?

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:18.160
What's 'ours' again?

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:19.780
Ah~zu?

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:23.420
A-war-zu!
*This nice looking inscription 'Awarzu' should be the english audience's new cheer sign for Ai*

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:25.580
*Incorrect basic word used"
The dog is ours.
Translation: (Google the words if you want)
Sono Inu Wa Watashi-tachi no mono desu.

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:29.440
I see... it's the last word huh..

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:30.300
Ah but!

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:31.580
The last..

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:32.460
Word's..

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.160
Since the 'rs' is there,

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:35.920
- so that was close isn't it?
*very close indeed...*

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.860
Just missed out the 'o' &amp; 'u'.

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:41.080
"The/that dog is ours" - I see.

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:43.460
Well.. you know... I did position the words correctly..

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:44.520
Just that I missed one of it

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:46.220
"The boy's dog"

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.400
Ah it'll be easy for me to translate this~

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:51.080
Well then...

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:52.940
Boy's dog...

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:55.320
The..

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:56.740
Dog...

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:58.420
Eh?

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:00.160
Boy's..

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:01.180
Stuff..

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:03.060

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:12.320
"The boy's dog"

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:13.960
Yes! I know it now~

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:15.440
"He drinks my tea"

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:22.780
Tea..

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:31.360
Do-ri~n-ku-su~
("Drinks" in english)
(ドリンクス in Katakana)

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:34.500
My...

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:37.320
'Tea' means..

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:39.860
What is it again?

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:43.560
Is it not?

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:44.620
Isn't it like this?

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:51.540
"My tea" is what it said right?

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:54.140
Which is translated as-

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:55.460
He..

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:58.180
Eh?

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:01.000
"He drinks my tea"

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:03.380

There's a spelling error.
He drinks my tea.
Translation:
「Kare wa Watashi no o-chya o nomimasu」

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:06.340
So close!!!

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:09.240
There wasn't a need for 'o'!

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.080
"He drinks my tea"

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:13.580
So that's it~

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:14.180
Eh!

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:16.140

The..

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:25.040
Cheese..

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:25.940

*Ai.exe has stopped responding*

Ah? That's all it needed to be correct?

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:42.120
Between the two words with 'I's , I chose "it" instead of the right word - "is".

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:47.500
It'll be embarassing if I keep getting so close to the correct answer &amp; don't get at least 5 score...

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:48.460
"I eat food"

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:53.220
I..

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:54.700
Eat..

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:56.480
Food.. - shouldn't get that wrong

00:06:57.860 --> 00:06:58.540
*eat ----&gt; it*

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:01.900
"I eat!" (food)

"It" - wasn't that what it said?!

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:11.880
Isn't the pronounciation a little too similar?

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:13.700
Please translate this sentence.

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:15.900
"I'll eat my own lunch"
*makes more sense*

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:16.920
I...

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:18.160
Am...

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:19.260
I am..

Lunch...

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:32.020
'Lunch' is spelled like this right?

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:34.580
"I am eat my lunch"
*rip grammar*

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:35.920
How is it?

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:36.920
*text reads*
Wrong use of word.
I eat my lunch.

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:38.900
Isn't that way too close?!

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:40.140
Too close!

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:41.840
Please look at it everyone!

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:43.360
"Am" wasn't needed?

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:44.240
Well, it's because...

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:46.240
My brain's too good for this small stuff~

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:47.460
So it's not compatible for use..

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:48.800
Please translate this sentence.

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:50.880
"The man drinks beer."

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:51.720
Hold on, this..

00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:53.960
I know which is the first word here

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:55.140
Because there's a uppercase here

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:56.500
The..

00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:57.420
Man..

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:00.000
Drink..

00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:03.020
Which one is 'beer'?

00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:04.840
Ah! This one!

00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:06.840
The..

00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:09.040
Man..

00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:10.000
Drink..

00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:11.660
Is it right?

00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:13.000
Well it's probably right..

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:13.620
*text reads*
Correct

00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:15.380
Told you~ Do you see that?

00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:17.500
I'm a specialist at translating right?

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:19.820
Well, but I'll have to choose if I want to do it properly.

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:21.520
Please translate the sentence.

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:23.380
"He eats the meal"

00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:26.140
See? It starts with a uppercase word.

00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:26.860
He..

00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:27.580
The..

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:31.660
It's ok as it is right?

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:35.000
*text reads*
Example of correct translation:
He eats the meal.

00:08:35.540 --> 00:08:38.080
If I let useless stuff into me-

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:39.400
-the next task will be done badly.

00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:41.220
Well! Well! This stuff happens sometimes.

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:47.360
It..

00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:48.700
Is..

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:50.760
My..

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:52.560
Child!

00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:03.760
*text reads*
There's a spelling error
It is my child.
Translation:
「Sore wa Watashi no Kodomo desu。」

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:07.920
There wasn't a need for 'a'

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:10.740
So close! I'm getting so close everytime~

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:13.040
"We drink water."

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:13.700
We..

00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:15.980
Drink..

00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:18.080
Water..

00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:20.240
*text reads*
Correct.

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:21.840
I can translate really well!

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:23.180
In Japanese - English.

00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:23.880
Flawless.

00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:28.200
You drink?..

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:31.660
Uh?

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:33.360
You drink..

00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:34.100
Melon?..
*completely different again xD*

00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:36.460
Meron?..

00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:37.720
*text reads*
Wrong use of word.
You drink milk.
Translation:
「Anata wa Gyunyu o Nomi masu。」

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:38.460
Milk?!

00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:41.560
I really like milk~!

00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:42.940
This is no good isn't it?

00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:45.020
"Welcome, Taro!"

00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:46.880
"Welcome, Taro!" in Japanese

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:48.100
Yes.

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:49.920
"Taro and I eat."

00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:51.280
Taro..

00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:54.940
Taro..

00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:56.540
Ah.. which one was it for this?..

00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:58.220
Taro~
*damn you lucky Taro*

00:09:58.220 --> 00:09:59.080
And..

00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:01.340
I..

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:04.380
Eat..

00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:06.320
*text reads*
Correct.

00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:07.580
Oh! It's correct!

00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:08.440
Awesome!

00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:14.400
I may just understood what it said even though it was fast.

00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:15.580
"How are you?" -

00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:17.060
How do I spell it again?

00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:18.320
Ha..

00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:19.060
Wa...

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:20.840
You?..

00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:23.620
*text reads*
Wrong use of words.
Good morning, how are you?
Translation:
「Ohaiyou Gozaimasu, o Genki desuka？」

00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:25.060
God... *giggles*

00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:27.260
It became "God morning"~

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:28.700
How are you?~

00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:30.040
I see so that's how it works...

00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:31.360
"Sayonara."
*If you don't know what this means, what are you doing here?*

00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:33.780
*text reads*
Correct.

00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:34.920
Oh~ Yes~

00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:37.640
"No, I am not fine."

00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:39.180
No..

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:40.300
I...

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:41.920
Ammu~

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:49.600
Eh? I don't understand..

00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:51.620
No, I am..

00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:55.900
I am..

00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:56.700
Ah..

00:10:58.620 --> 00:10:59.520
Fine~!

00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:01.620
What about "Fine" ?

00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:08.200
Not..

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:10.440
"Fine" - what's that?

00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:12.160
WAIN?!

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:12.660
WAI?!

00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:15.520
*text reads*
Wrong use of word.

00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:17.280
"Yes, I'm fine"

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:18.680
Yes.

00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:20.340
Fine..

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:27.240
*text reads*
Wrong use of word.

00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:28.680
So close!

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:31.120
So close! It's really close!

00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:40.900
Ah! I just did it just now!

00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:42.880
I've properly studied~

00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:44.860
Is "how" written like this?

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:47.480
I feel like it's an 'o' instead of 'a'.

00:11:50.380 --> 00:11:50.960
Awesome!

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:52.720
I've properly studied!

00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:56.400
I'm fine.

00:11:57.500 --> 00:11:58.280
*text reads*
Example of correct translation:
「Ee, Genki-desu。」

00:11:58.300 --> 00:11:59.140
*she missed out "ええ" which represents "Yes"*

00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:00.220
I see.

00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:05.400
No..

00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:06.340
No thanks.

00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:14.460
You've run out of hearts.

00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:17.520
So we have to start from the "Basic 1" yes?

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:19.040
So that's how it is.

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:20.940
I'll accept the challenge.

00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:22.860
So how did everyone do?

00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:26.400
I really need a English plugin right~?

00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:28.500
Do I need the plugin?

00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:29.800
I need it don't I?

00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:31.780
Well but~

00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:35.380
If I have to start from the basics - that means I'll have to start over again

00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:36.920
Well especially since..

00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:38.540
From basic- Ah! I know it's that..

00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:39.580
For English~!

00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:43.260
For people in Japan that can't understand English well -

00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:46.400
I'll start from the basics and learn together with you~

00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:47.240
With that said,

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:49.260
-from now on, let's work hard together on English!

00:12:50.780 --> 00:12:52.100
See you again~
