Even though it's already halloween, I'm still wearing the same outfit...

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:11.840
Ahhh...I wanna change my outfit to something like a cat

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:13.180
or maybe like a demon~

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:14.360
I wanna wear all kinds of costumes!

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.060
