00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.100
What's up everyone?

00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:03.540
In the spirit of GraphicStock's
Creator2Creator initiative,

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:05.900
here is what we made
with our GraphicStock subscription.

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:07.320
Hope you enjoy it.

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:16.600
[sighs] Home!

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.100
[Irene] I'm leaving...

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.080
Ooo... going out on a Friday night?
I know what that means.

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:23.780
Wait!

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:26.160
You shaved your legs,

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.200
but you're wearing flip flops.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.760
You're wearing falsies,
but also reading glasses?

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.500
And you're wearing a crop top, ugh, 
under an old hoodie?

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.000
Do you even know where you are going?

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:40.300
I'm meeting up with Tim.

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.200
Tim from marketing? Is it a date?

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:44.000
I don't know.

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.100
We got back from our work trip
and said we'd eat and finish the account

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.820
but then our presentation got cancelled,
but we didn't cancel the eating part so,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.600
now we are just getting dinner.

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.100
Well, do you want it to be a date?

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.800
I mean... he is cute, dorky,

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.300
oblivious at times but...

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.800
I guess I wouldn't mind if it were.

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.600
[gasps]
Oh yay!

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:06.900
Hold on!

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.300
Uh, this is great and all but...

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.900
it's not really a date
unless he also thinks it's a date.

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:13.800
Okay, but how will I know?

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:15.500
Oh it should be obvious.

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:16.900
So obvious.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:18.260
There will be signs.

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:19.480
[phone vibrates]

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:21.500
He's here.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.020
[gasp] He's picking you up?

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.100
That's a sign.

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.000
[whispers] Okay.

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:28.840
Grab some heels, too.

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.020
Ooo, but he didn't come to the door...

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.400
Inconclusive. Have fun!

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.500
-Hey Tim!
-Hey.

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:52.200
[Tim] So...

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.340
before we leave,
I want to give you something.

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.000
You got me something?

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.100
Yeah!

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.260
Well, Tim, you didn't have to get me...

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:05.400
receipts!

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.000
Yeah, they're our work receipts
from our business trip?

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:11.760
Oh...

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.500
You handle reimbursements, right?

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:14.600
Yeah!

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.200
Great. Cool.

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.700
Hey, I just wanted to say, uh...

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:23.740
I really like your style, tonight.

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:26.600
Really?

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:28.000
Thanks!

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:29.700
Yeah, I have the same hoodie.

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:35.400
Hey, uh, one sec?

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.200
I'm gonna get something
from this flower guy.

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.180
Tim, stop... [laughs]

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:46.100
[sighs]

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.400
I needed change for a 50.

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.500
-Gotcha. Yeah.
-Yeah.

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:52.440
Tim?

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.400
Oh my God, are you always here?

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.700
Last time I was here, was with you.

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:59.360
Oh how rude. This is Irene.

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.700
Oh... Irene?

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.400
Heard so much about you.

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:07.200
Is that right?

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.400
Oh, Irene. This is my Maya "girlfriend."

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:12.360
What!?

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:13.540
Maya

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.200
Ghufran.

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:16.600
It's Arabic.

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:18.880
[Maya] He always mispronounce it.

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:20.700
Such a pretty name!

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:21.800
Thanks!

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.700
You know, I don't know
if you know this but,

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:26.300
you're on a date.

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:28.340
Am I?

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.600
Yeah, you are on a date. Look!

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:35.240
Eww.

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.220
There are a bunch of date trees
on this street,

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.060
I've been stepping on them myself.

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.600
Don't you hate it when you're on a date 
and you don't even know it?

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:42.800
That does suck!

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:45.900
Anyways, we got a reservation,
so we gotta go.

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:49.000
Okay, no worries. 
Watch out for those dates.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:50.460
I'm trying.

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:56.200
Uh, thanks!

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:57.740
That was delicious.

00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.620
I'm really glad we did this.

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:01.300
Mhmm...

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:13.060
Didn't know you're the type
to play footsies.

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:14.640
Oh my God.

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:15.720
That's your foot?

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:17.660
I have an itch,

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.180
and I thought I was scratching it
on the leg of the table,

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:21.900
and you have a very rigid leg.

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:25.200
Whenever you're ready.

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:28.400
Let me get this...

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:34.000
parking validated.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:35.000
Waiter?

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:36.940
[sighs]

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:40.300
Uh... hey, are you okay?

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:42.200
You have been anxious all night.

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:44.000
Fine.

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:46.900
Yes, I've been freaking out all night
and my plan is to play it cool

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.600
because I was told there will be signs
but clearly that didn't work out.

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.800
So screw all the signs and subtext
and let's be direct,

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:54.500
because I think you are really awesome

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:57.000
and we'd waste last time
if we just cut to the chase.

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:57.940
So...

00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:59.280
is this a date?

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:01.180
[sighs]

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:07.100
Irene.

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:09.440
Of course, this is a date.

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:13.940
It's our...

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:16.000
third date.

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:20.360
Right?

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:29.360
Well, hope you guys related to that one.

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:31.200
I hope-- No, I hope you guys
didn't relate to that one.

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:32.400
[laughs]

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:36.600
It was actually based off of one 
of our Wong Fu teammates, Jennifer Le.

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:38.900
Yea apparently, she's been
in this situation many of times.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:39.900
Is it really that compl--

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.400
Well no, not exactly where you're
like stepping on dates,

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:44.268
but just the ambiguity of like,

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:47.000
"What is this? Is this a hang out
or is a date?"

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:48.860
Guys, let's just--
let's just be more up front.

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:50.900
So actually all those graphics
that came up on screen,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.660
we actually got them
from a website called GraphicStock.com

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:55.700
