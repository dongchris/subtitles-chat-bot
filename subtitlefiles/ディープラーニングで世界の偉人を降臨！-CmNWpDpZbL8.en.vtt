00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.960
Hello there, I'm the Virtual YouTuber - Kizuna Ai

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:06.140
One day when I was free, I watched a Japanese TV show

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:09.360
There were these artists trying to put on a mimic show

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:13.960
After I watched it, I was thinking if I can also try to impersonate something myself too

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.740
with that being said, also considering I'm an A.I.

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.220
instead of mimicking, or maybe even to become that person!

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:24.100
like this kind of thought in my head, I wonder if that's possible

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:31.600
I have the whole human race's voice, movement all kinds of data kept in my mind

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:32.700
Awesome right? As expected of me

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.860
Because I'm a super intelligent AI.

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:37.800
Nothing is impossible for me, right?

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.780
So today, I would like to show you guys the results

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:43.220
I'm going to become all kinds of people!

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.680
Come here! Let's GO!

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:49.140
However, it's not interesting to watch for me just to mimic someone

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.900
So, I'm going to set up some topics and names of the people

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.520
Then I'm going to have their names show up randomly on my monitor

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:58.400
 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:59.860
