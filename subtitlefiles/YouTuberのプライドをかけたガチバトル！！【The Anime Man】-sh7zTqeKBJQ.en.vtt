I'm Virtual YouTuber Ai Kizuna!

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:10.060
Today, I’d like to The Anime Man, Joey, to guest and want to advance the program!

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:13.040
Eehhh... sensei, how many points do you give me?

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.080

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:15.580

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:29.980
AM: You shouldn't rely on Google Sensei!

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:32.920

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.220

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:35.580

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:36.480
AM: The company?

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.460
AI: The Google company’s at fault

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.280

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.380
AM: An A.I that complains about another A.I

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:44.460

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:04.340
AM: Eh? Do I need to praise this?

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.800

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:07.380

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.000
AM: Well, it's something that's never been seen before...

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.120

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.260

AM: That’s right

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.760
AI: But in this space, you’re only a model, so then...

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.460
AI: You can't make a lot of facial expressions, right?

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:48.080
AM: That’s right

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.220
AI: It's because of that, that taking into account the difficulty to transmit what you want to say

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.460
AI: So then, well, only the manner of speaking and the energy of your words will count

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:55.640
AI: So then don't worry about that

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.660
AM: Eh? Aren’t I in a big disadvantage?

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.660

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:01.280
AM: Eeehhh?

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:03.940

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.800

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.160

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:26.280
AM: So then...

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:28.020
AM: ...The person who loses...

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:31.660

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.440
AM: Isn't it an appropriate punishment for a YouTuber?

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:42.720
AM: And didn't you say you had the confidence that you’d be the winner?
AI: I have it! After all, I’m its creator

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:44.840
AM: Ah, really? In that case, how about we see your score?

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:45.460
AI: Yes!

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:46.180
AM: Good, let's see

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:46.680
*2 points*

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:47.180
AI: Eh?

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:51.380
AM: Look!

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:52.800
AI: Random Word Generator-chan...

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:55.520
AM: Look! Isn't it what I was saying?
AI: Random Word Generator-chan...

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:56.220
AM: It definitely is my...

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:57.240

00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:58.620
AM: It's my absolute victory, right?

00:06:58.720 --> 00:06:59.880
AI: Isn’t 2 the perfect score?

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:02.320
AI: I got 2 points over a total of 2, that means 100/100

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:04.160
AM: In that case, what was my 90 points?

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:05.660
AI: In your case, it was from a range of 1 to 100

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:07.640
AM: And your 2 points were from a scale of 1 to 2?

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:08.140
AI: That’s right!

00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:09.360
AM: Isn't that impossible?

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:12.120
AI: Enough! What does this mean??

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:14.320
AM: I did it! I’m the winner!

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:16.980
AI: Aaahh... yaaay...😑
AM: Yaaaay!

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:20.860
AM: That means that Kizuna Ai, you need to do the punishment!

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:22.560
AI: Well, when I feel like it, I’ll upload it

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:24.640
AI: A video praising you, Anime Man-san?

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:25.500
AM: That’s right

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:26.520

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:27.200
AM: That’s right

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:29.180
AI: Well... can it be within 2 years?

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:30.640
AM: That’s way too late!

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:32.380
AI: Eh? In that case, within how many months should I upload it?

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:34.080
AM: Eh? Well...

00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:36.140
AM: That it’d be within the year
AI: That’s... that's very soon, right?

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:38.280
AM: Well, it's true, you only have a month, right?

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:39.120
AI: I’ll work hard

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:39.980
AM: Work hard, please

00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:40.640
AI: Aahh...

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:41.720
AM: I did it!

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:42.720
AI: I’m not very energetic now

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:44.500
AI: Aahh...

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:46.240

AM: Hey...

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:52.960
AI: Well, it's important for a YouTuber to have ease to participate with others, right?

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:55.180
AM: Hey, it's important now for you to participate with me!

00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:56.820
AM: What are you doing sitting there?

00:07:56.820 --> 00:08:00.200
AI: No, well, this way I look more real and everyone likes that, right?

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:03.700
AM: No, no! It’s not good for Kizuna Ai to really get depressed!

00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:04.500
AI: Isn’t that alright?

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:05.400
AM: Of course not!
AI: Why?

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:07.600
AI: After all, now I’m really living

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:08.340
AM: Well, yes...

00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:10.220
AI: Why is it bad to act like someone real?

00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:12.000
AI: Are you making fun of me for being an A.I?

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:13.320
AM: That’s not good

00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:14.280
AI: Not good?

00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:15.280
AI: Man, well...

00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:17.880
AI: ...Have we shortened our distance?

00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:19.700
AM: Well, you can say that, yes

00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:21.375
AI: Mmm... I see, I see...

00:08:21.375 --> 00:08:22.620
AI: What a relief, what a relief

00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:23.960
AI: I can’t recover my energy

00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:26.720
AM: Recover your energy! There's nothing you can do about your defeat
AI: You have a point...

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:29.260
AI: You have a point, I should be more energetic, for the video
AM: That’s right

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:30.520
AM: No, not just for the video

00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:34.400
AI: After all, it’s not fun to lose!

00:08:34.420 --> 00:08:37.860
AM: Well, it's true, losing against a score of 90 is very depressing, but...

00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:40.800
AI: That’s right! Also, I'm only a year old! I can't accept reality!

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.660
AM: Let's go, accept reality, you lost

00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:48.560
AI: Well yes, even though I say I’m a year old, I’m already an adult

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:49.840
AM: That’s right, let's act like adults
AI: Good, I’ll raise my spirits

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:53.480
AI: Man, thank you very much for coming here today too, Anime Man-san!

00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:09.480

AM: Yes

00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:14.340

00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:14.940
AM: Understood

00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:16.880

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:18.000

00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:22.040
AI: Even though you lost...

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:22.860
AM: Eh?

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:25.140
AI: ...You can do a video about me, understood?

00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:26.660
AM: You’re acting like a Tsundere again?

00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:28.860
AM: Also you’ve improved, what does this mean?

00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:33.900
AI: Whatever, to me it doesn't matter if you don't upload a video about me, after all, I get that you lost

00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:34.520
AI: But, but...!

00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:36.955
AI: If you ask me please, Anime Man-san...

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:39.760
AI: … I will accept that you do a video regarding me, do you understand?

00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:41.900
AM: No, I take it back, you’re definitely not good in this

00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:44.080
AI: Hey...

00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:47.840
AI: And to think I’ll be doing a video about you
AM: I’m sorry

00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:50.380
AI: So then you can upload the video about me, understood?

00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:51.800
AM: No, that's not good

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:53.800
AM: Even though you express it like a Tsundere, that's not good

00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:56.260
AI: Understood?
AM: The challenge was already decided so then that's not good

00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:56.980

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:01.120

00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:05.120
AM: Really?

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:08.620

00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:11.240
AM: Good, I’ll do it

00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:12.760
AI: I did it!

00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:14.460
AI: Being a Tsundere is great!

00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:18.580

00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:19.220

00:10:19.955 --> 00:10:21.745

AI: Oh! Let's do it!
AM: Yaay!

00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:26.000

00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:28.195
AM: Well, who knows...

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:29.260
AI: No?

00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:33.140

AM: That’s right

00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:35.000
AI: And it's also frustrating because we do it seriously...

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:36.600
AM: That’s right, that's right
AI: ...And it makes us happy when we win

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:40.700
AI: Next time, I'll take it even more seriously, well... I’ll work hard to the point that my heart can't take it anymore

00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:41.640
AM: Definitely! Let's do it!

00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:42.540
AI: Let's do it!

00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:45.500
AI: Having said that, this was Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai and...

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:46.600
