00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.700
Hello! Virtual YouTuber, Kizuna Ai here!

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.625
Well! Today! It's probably what everyone anticipated!

00:00:05.625 --> 00:00:07.300
A compilation of my NGs!
(NG= No Good)

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.840
I've been posting some of them on twitter once a while but..

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.340
There was nothing really special

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.180
But today I'm gonna show you some!

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:15.560
It's not like I don't have any good ideas for my new videos or anything!  ;P

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:17.560
Compilation of NGs! Let's GO!

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.560
Depends on the Region.....

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:22.100
Depends on the Region... activity...

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.380
The job hunting period..

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:27.660
Usually starts around September to October...

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:32.120
"Uhm, everyone! The earnings this season..." *laughter*

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.400
First off, you have to start by asking...aheee..

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:36.800
What was that just now..

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:40.000
First off, you have to start asking...ehh, what...

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:41.400
This part is important!

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.540
The beer's bottle label should face up...

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.740
I've done a physical fitness test too!

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.160
But since I got such a regretful...

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:50.860
!%&amp;*$@&amp;

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:51.860
Result!

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:53.740
Since I got such a regretful result...

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:56.780
Throughout 26 years, the average across the country....

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:58.800
Throughout 26 years..

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.860
The average record for female across the country..

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.440
Is 13 meters!

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.840
And that concludes the third day...of.. Ah!

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.400
The Guinness record is 43.56 seconds!

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:10.780
The record bolder..

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:16.520
The record holder is a Borussia Dortmund supporter, a german soccer team

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.380
took the title..

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.640
I have to be serious...aim for...I hope

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.400
So! With that being said!

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.800
And that concludes the third day... Ah..

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.780
I can't forget...

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.360
For sure! Rememb..

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.280
A word you need to remember for sure!

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:33.680
..I meant Kanji!

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.980
Just like what Kinpachi sensei said before, because there are support between...Eh?

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:39.160
People...

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:40.655
Excuse me!

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:43.500
It's convenient because we have machines, right?

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.080
We have right! But...years ago these heavy baggage..

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.500
They have to carry themselves...ehm..?

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.460
They... therefore have to carry it themselves...

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.720
So..''Hataraku''(to work) this word

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.260
You also call it "Hakobu"(to bring)

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:56.780
Wait.. that's wrong *laughter*

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:57.940
That was a lie

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:59.620
GURANPURAAA

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:00.920
So with that said..

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:01.515
Nnnnn?

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:02.900
So with that being said!

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.560
With all kind of dangerous "zen..."

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.220
It's not zenbutsu.. it should be seibutsu (creatures)

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:07.540
Medusa

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:10.360
Is a monster appears in the Greek mythology

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.260
Her hair is made up of countless of snakes

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:14.640
Inon...???

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:15.880
So how was it?

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.720
These wonderful NG scenes..

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.915
These are all calculated...I am an A.I after all

00:02:20.915 --> 00:02:23.825
I don't have to do these NG at all though you know~

00:02:23.825 --> 00:02:26.620
It's all for this moment~ all served a purpose

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.740
So please keep supporting me in the future!

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:30.880
It's Virtual Youtuber, Kizuna Ai here!~

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:31.880
