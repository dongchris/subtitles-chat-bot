Hello everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai here!

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:03.660
A.I.Channel

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:04.620
Channel subscribers

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.280
1.5 million!

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:07.840
We've reached it!

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:09.700
* Dancing *

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.440
Seriously, thank you everyone!

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:12.680
There's been a lot

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:15.580
But overall, I really feel like I'm steadily connecting with more of you!

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:16.975
Truth be told, last week...

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.680
I was at almost 1.46 million subscribers, and...

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.280
"I'm just a little away from 1.5 million!"

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:25.760
Just when I was thinking of releasing a video like that

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:26.360
Minus

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.120
Minus 240,000!

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:30.260
That happened out of nowhere, so I panicked

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:31.480
I panicked!

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:32.540
I was like, "Wait, what?"

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:35.820
"Hey, Google admins~"

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.060
I went crying to the person from Google who looks after me

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:40.180
Apparently it was just a bug

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.840
My subscribers came back, so that was really really good!

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:44.940
Last year was a BAN...

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.060
And this year was a subscriber mass deleting bug...

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:49.660
February is an evil month!

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:51.880
Google, April Fools’

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.040
is in April!!

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:54.960
But! Being in a pinch is also a chance, so

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.300
As long as I recover!!

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.020
Honestly, it's quite juicy♪

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:59.440
As a result, I got more subscribers?

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.500
I'm at 1.5 million now?

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:03.220
Juicy~!!

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:04.540
I've got it all

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:05.660
As expected of Ai-chan

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:06.400
Kizuna-san?

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.340
I wonder what's going to happen next year?

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.040
But!

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:09.600
Ehh

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:10.420
Ai-chan

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.560
You artificially inflated your subscribers?

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:13.920
I used to believe in you...

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.440
I don't want people to think anything like that!

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.280
You, right there, who doubted me for a second

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:20.540
I'm clean!

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:21.220
Pure pure!

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:22.200
Completely white!

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.280
So, news website reporters

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.520
Legitimately reached 1.5 million subscribers!

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:28.800
She was completely innocent!

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:29.980
Congratulations, Ai-chan!!

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:31.400
Please make an article like that!

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.020
The bond I have with all of you that subscribe to me

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.360
is no fake one!

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:36.720
I’ll be counting on you guys!

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.060
Alright, this was virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.220
See you~!

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:43.920
