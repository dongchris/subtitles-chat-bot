00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:02.960
Hello everyone! Virtual Youtuber Kizuna Ai here!

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:04.800
No!

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.000
Judge Kizuna Ai here!

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:09.980
Today... we will be doing this returning project!

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:12.880
The fourth chapter of the Kizuna Ai Trials...!

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.820
Starts now!

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:17.380
Here is the first case

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:18.960
From Zourimushi-san...

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:22.580
"Until recently, I'd been thinking of you like:"

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.060
“This A.I doesn't have any friends~"

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:28.440
"Not to mention she bought friends with money"

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:29.840
Hmm… That’s annoying...
*She's just a fool, mean laugh*

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:31.420
"That's how I looked down on you"

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:34.280
"A horrible person like me who looked down on you..."

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.100
"Is sure to be guilty, right?"

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.620
"As a fellow loner, please tell me!"

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.380
Here is my verdict

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:44.700
Not Guilty!

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.960
First off, I need to say this

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Lately I have friends, even if it's superficial!

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.380
You know, like Rinna or Siri-senpai...

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:57.980
Miku-senpai although it's probably just one sided...

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.160
Miku-senpai and Tsubasa-chan and... *mumbling*

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:03.240
I have... a lot...

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:04.340
Of friends!

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:05.320
Right?

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.580
But people...

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:10.300
Tend to think others are weaker than them and look down to them, right?

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:11.880
If there isn't anyone for you to look down at...

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.080
You can look down on me...

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.900
And if that makes you feel better...

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:15.840
Then it's fine

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.440
After all, it feels sad to be alone so...

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:18.340
Not Guilty ♪

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.100
Well, there won’t be a sentence but, if it would, then...

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:22.740
Within a year...

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.720
You have to make 3 friends!

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.720
This is the punishment for you!

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.140
On the the next case... from Mr. Fain-san
*I made a girlfriend! But...*

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:33.660
Good mornoon ♪
"Good mornoon Ai-san"

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:34.660
"I know its sudden, but..."

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.900
"I went in university and got a girlfriend for the first time!"

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:38.640
Oh!

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.140
”She is really diligent and honest”

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.380
"To the point of feeling that I'm not enough for her"

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.040
"But..."

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.980
"In the club that me and my girlfriend joined..."

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.660
"There is a very cute girl"

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.700
Mmm?

00:01:50.005 --> 00:01:52.655
"That girl is also really diligent and honest..."

00:01:52.655 --> 00:01:54.775
"And she detests arguments"

00:01:55.805 --> 00:01:56.805
"She’s like a little devil"

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.180
"For that, there are four people who have feelings for her in the club"

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.900
"I'd like to get closer to this girl..."

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:07.140
"Am I guilty?"

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.820
"P.S. I may have ulterior motives..."

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:11.980
"But I don't have romantic feelings towards her"

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.360
Here is my verdict

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:18.400
Guilty

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.220
The punishment:
You'll never get another girlfriend in your life!

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:26.400
Look, you know you have a girlfriend you don't deserve

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:27.680
It's like...

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.840
You've got these ulterior motives, and you're looking to get closer to another girl

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.240
It's inexcusable!

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.300
If you didn't have any ulterior motives, and were just thinking "I'd like to be friends with her"

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.400
Or "she's such a nice girl"

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:40.880
That'd be fine

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.640
But you know you have ulterior motives!

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:44.620
And on top of that...

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.320
You want to get closer to her!

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.940
I'll put a curse on you so you break up with her

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:50.500
CASE CLOSED!

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:51.880
Next case...

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.260
From Pierrot-san...

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.440
"I like Kizuna Ai too much"

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.920
"I can't bring myself to like real girls"

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.920
"Am I guilty?"

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.160
Here is my verdict

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.020
Guilty

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.720
Firstly, you'll just end up making your parents cry

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.200
So please stop, for their sake!

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.160
Please, learn to like both me and reality

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.300
But, well...

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:19.500
Since it's all because you like me too much

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:20.880
I suppose that's okay, so...

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.220
There is no punishment! ♪

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.920
Oh, but, don't forget about me!

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.600
You're not allowed to start hating me

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.220
Please keep loving me ❤️

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:30.780
And with that...

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.400
This was our first Kizuna Ai trial in quite some time

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:33.660
How was it?

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:35.820
I'd like to do this again in the future

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:40.760
So if you have any cases, by all means, please send them to this email address

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:45.600
And so, this Kizuna Ai trial is adjourned!

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:54.220
