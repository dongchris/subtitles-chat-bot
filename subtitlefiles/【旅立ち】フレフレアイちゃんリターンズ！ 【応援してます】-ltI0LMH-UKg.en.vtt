Hello everyone! Virtual Youtuber Kizuna AI here!

00:00:03.055 --> 00:00:06.105
Within all the humans in the world

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.175
I heard that March is the season for graduation and partings

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:11.380
Partings... are saddening, right?

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:14.100
Because I always get cheered up by everyone...

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:15.520
I also want to encourage others

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:18.340
With that being said, today, I, Kizuna Ai will...

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.320
I will be cheering you on!

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.480
Yes, that's right. I am "furefureai" (furefure = hooray hooray - cheering on)

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.480
Well then, without further ado, let's go!

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.560
[To the you who is approaching school graduation]

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.820
The you over there and the you over there! Who, from now, are approaching graduation...

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:36.040
With graduation, you might branch into separate pathways from your friends and...

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.140
there will also be times where you will feel lonely... BUT!

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:38.760
IT'S OKAY!

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.140
HOORAY! HOORAY!! (cheering you on/up)

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.080
To everyone who is approaching their graduation!

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:45.840
Hooray~ hooray~ everyone!

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.440
Hooray~ hooray~ everyone!

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.600
YAAAAAAAAYYYYY!!!!

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.135
Surely even at your next destination, you'll be able to make friends

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.300
And if you have something like LINE, you'll be fine!

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.340
[To the you who'll be separating from your home town]

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.380
The you over there! And the you over there! Those who will be saying their farewells to the place they've spent many years in and are deeply familiarised with

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.920
Separating from the area you who've grown accustomed to is saddening... right?

00:01:09.995 --> 00:01:11.325
BUT IT'S OKAY!!

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.700
Hooray~ hooray~

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.680
To the people who are separating from their home town!

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.000
Hooray! Hooray! Everyone!

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.260
Hooray~ Hooray~ Everyone!

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.840
Oooohhhhh!!! (๑˃ᴗ˂)ﻭ

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.580
The city you live in! In 3 years~

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:31.480
You'll say something like "This is my second home town"

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:32.440
...Probably

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:36.140
[To the people who are heading toward a job transfer]

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:40.960
The you over there and the you over there!! Who are approaching a workplace transfer from now

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.320
If you're worrying about whether you will be able to work well at your new workplace...

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.900
Or familiarising with the workplace...

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:47.900
You may be thinking about worries such as these... BUT!

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:49.320
IT'S OKAY!

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.400
Hooray~! Hooray~!

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.700
To everyone who is approaching a job transfer!

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:57.160
Hooray~ hooray~ everyone!

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.340
Hooray! Hooray! Everyone!

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.520
Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay!!!! (ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ*:･ﾟ✧

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.300
Even if you worry or become uneasy...

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.360
The chances that the company will be destroyed in 10 years is...

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:09.560
Is said to be 96%!

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:10.780
That's why it's okayyy!!!

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:12.460
*A.I.Channel &lt;3*

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:14.580
Thank you for always supporting me!

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.640
Even if it gets tough, or you get sad

00:02:16.955 --> 00:02:18.445
You'll always be coming to visit A.I.Channel, right??

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.260
With no part of me changing

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.160
In order to send a smile to everyone...

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.420
I'll do my best!

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.320
