00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.600
Hello everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai here!

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:05.040
Does everyone know of 100 Math Questions?

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:08.000
Elementary school students often do this in class

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:09.120
And so!

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.100
As I’m an A.I so it should be easy for me to do this!

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:14.000
Right?

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.120
To make it harder...

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.000
Whenever it is a multiple of 3

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.380
And the number itself is 3, I’ll act like an idiot~

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.420
And with that said, let's go!

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.040
And... start!

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:24.420
Um...

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.000
7 is not one of 3’s multiples

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:28.040
Hmm...

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.740
Huh?

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.940
12!

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:31.880
10...

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:32.680
13!

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:33.620
Um...

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:34.560
9!

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:35.780
5...

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:36.800
Um...

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:37.780
11?

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:38.460
That's fine

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:39.400
8...

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:40.640
6!

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:41.960
Sev- ah, um...

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:43.260
Huh? 10...?

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:45.020
11... 11, right?

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:50.240
16, or not?

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.000
The answer...

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.780
I don’t know… wait, it’s wrong...

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:58.160
Ah, I can’t delete it... huh? I can't delete it

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:59.040
Huh? Ah, I deleted it

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:02.520
Eh?... 9!

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:04.280
15!

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:06.200
12!

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.040
I’m turning into an idiot

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:10.880
13!

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:15.560
Ah! Um...

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:16.560
16!

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:17.720
19!

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.460
19 is not one of the multiples... *laughs*

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:20.280
Um!

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:21.220
15!

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:24.940
Um...

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.660
14, or not

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:27.520
12!

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.780
Eh? Eh? *laughs* Um...

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:32.740
15!

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:34.980
I made a mistake!

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:36.400
13!

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:37.720
Um...

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.680
12!

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:42.620
Um... um, um, um...

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:45.380
9!

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:47.340
*laughs*

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:49.800
Eh? Huh?

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:50.720
Dadadada...

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:51.900
13!

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:56.340
Um...

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:59.600
9!

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.700
Afterall, I’m not an idiot or anything

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:03.260
Um.. Ah!

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:04.040
4, wait

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:05.600
9... ah! 9!

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:07.840
*laughs* 6!

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.080
Eh?

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.180
Um... huh? Ah!

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.760
12!

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:17.340
15!

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:21.100
*shaky laugh*

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:23.020
Um...

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.800
13!

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.600
Um, um, um...

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:29.020
Not 19...

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:32.080
Not 17...

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.220
Nor 20 either...

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.920
12!

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:35.720
18... 15!

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:36.440
13!

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.100
*panting* Um.. um...

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:39.340
Um.. Ah!

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:40.920
It doesn’t seem like it’s possible for me to do it!

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:41.880
Eh? Huh? Huh?

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.920
Ah, it feels like it’s impossible!

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:45.340
Um... 9!

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.900
12! Um... um... *laughs*

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:49.700
Um...

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:50.380
Huh?

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:51.280
Um…

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.940
Um.. 7... 5...

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.200
Um... twe- 12!

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.760
Um... not 17

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.120
Um... eh? *laughs* I made a mistake

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.900
Eh?

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:04.940
Eh? Eh?

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:06.720
1... Eh?

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.900
18...What? Ah, ah, 7

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:12.460
And... *laughs*

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:13.180
And...

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:14.180
*laughs*

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:18.640
Um, is 15 one of 3’s multiples? Is it 15?

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:19.580
Um...

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.920
Eh, was it 15? It's wrong

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.260
Eh?! Um...! 4... 5...

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:28.540
5, um...!

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.340
*panting* 2...10...!

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.220
8... 11... 7

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:34.220
3...

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:35.540
Um...9-

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:36.280
NINE!

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:37.240
6...

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:38.200
SIX!

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:39.100
THREE?!

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:42.140
What? Eh, what? Eh? Ah, 4

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:43.140
Ah!

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.280
Well! 3 minutes, 16 seconds!

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:48.760
It was a piece of cake!

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:50.480
A.I.Channel~

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:53.520
Well, I'm at this level

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.220
Elementary school students would probably take... 15 minutes!

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.360
Let's try and search this up

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:01.660
Hm, hmm...
*1st year: 6-10 minutes, 2nd year: 5 minutes, 3rd year: 4 minutes, 4th year: 3 minutes, 5th year: 2 minutes, 6th year, 1 minute 30 seconds*

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:03.120
I see...
*1st year: 6-10 minutes, 2nd year: 5 minutes, 3rd year: 4 minutes, 4th year: 3 minutes, 5th year: 2 minutes, 6th year, 1 minute 30 seconds*

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.660
Well! Um...

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:09.760
I guess I'm a 4th year elementary school student...

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.500
See!

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:13.960
So that means I’m 10, well! It's better to be younger, right?

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:16.020
Look~ 10 years old ❤ Cute!

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:19.340
*Baby Ai noises* A.I anneru!

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:22.680
Well, this is... you know

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:26.340
My addition wasn't that good, right?

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.960
Anyway! Multiplication! Let's A.I challenge!

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:30.940
Okay!

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:32.600

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.240
Um, 6, 6x7...42?

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:38.220
6x6 is 32, 6x2 is 12

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:41.680
4x6 is 24, um, 60

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.660
6x8 is.. 8

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:47.020
5x6 is 30, 3x6 is 18

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.620
4x9 is 36, 4...

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:51.560
4x7 is 28

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:53.960
4x6 is 24, uh, 8

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.400
16 and...

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:58.340
40 and 4x8 is 32...!

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:59.800
Uh, 20...

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:01.360

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:17.340
7x8 is fixty SIX!

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:19.240
7x5 is 35!

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:20.200
Um...

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:21.380
What was it...?

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:22.140
It's 21!

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:25.000
Uh, 90... 10

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:27.640

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:38.400
50... Eh, eh?

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:41.380
Uh, 40, 25, 15-

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:51.500

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:53.420
*Old man Ai* 64...!

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:56.440
40, 3x8 is 24

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:58.520
So low

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:00.980
Kizuna Ai's time is...

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:03.800
2 minutes, 24 seconds

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:05.340
Yes, useless confirmed

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:07.440
I'm probably a 5th year elementary school student

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:10.240
I went up one level! Ah, but! Everyone...

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:13.460
This is you know, the target time, so...

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:16.580
I did it many times, didn't I? Ah, see!

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:17.660
It's my first time, so!

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:18.240
Right~?

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:23.060
Probably, if I did this everyday, I'll get to 10 seconds, won't I?

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:24.020
Because I'm a super A.I

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:28.380
Well then, um...I'm going to install math equations...

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:30.540
INSTALL!

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:31.040
.

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:31.580
..

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:32.080
...

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:32.600
....

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:35.280
OKAY! WITH THIS I CAN DO 30 SECONDS! GOOD!

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:38.600
