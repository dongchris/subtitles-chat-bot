00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.020
Amy, I really like you.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:11.520
Me too.

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.700
I just had to tell you, I like you.

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:22.100
More than a friend.

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:23.480
Oh...

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:26.700
Did she just say, "Oh"?

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:28.760
I'm gonna be sick.

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.000
A lot of us out there know what it's like
to be in this position.

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:35.700
And we all hope that
it will go something like this:

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:36.900
I like you.

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:38.820
I feel the same way!

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:40.200
Let's hug tenderly.

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.200
Was that too much to ask?

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.200
I'm guessing last night didn't go well?

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.400
I messed up. I thought she had feelings,
but she didn't see me that way.

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.160
She hates you.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.200
Hate's a feeling.

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:57.340
I just feel...

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.000
used.

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.060
Or you just feel unwanted
and you're taking it out on her.

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:08.180
Do you want to talk about it?

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.920
There's nothing left to talk about.
It's over. It's done.

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.680
I just wish I knew why.

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:15.780
Partner!

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:36.880
Nice guys finish drunk.

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:38.100
Whoa!

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:42.740
And then I realize
there was no hope for nice.

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:43.920
Never has--

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.500
Are you in the middle of one
of your internal monologues?

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.300
Yes. Thanks for interrupting.
