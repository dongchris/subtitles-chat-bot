00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:02.900
Hi there, Virtual Wrestler, Kizuna Ai here.

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:07.920
Today I'm going to show you how to defeat various dangerous creatures.

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:10.640
There's no telling what could happen these days.

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:14.260
You'll never know when, where, or by what type of dangerous creature you may be attacked!

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:15.020
*virtually dodges*

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:16.860
And so, let's go!

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.400
The first creature is...

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:20.640
a Tyrannosaurus!

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.600
A Tyrannosaurus is a dinosaur.

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:29.020
From the samples we've discovered, they were about 11 to 13 metres in height.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.600
And had heads that were about 1.5 metres long.

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.240
About as tall as me!

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:37.240
They are estimated to have weighed 5 to 6 tonnes!

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:38.080
They'd squish you like a pancake!

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:43.600
As of currently, they are believed to be the biggest land-roaming carnivorous dinosaurs,

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.900
And also one of the biggest terrestrial carnivores of all time.

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.240
Now, let's defeat one!

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.560
Without further ado, practice, start!

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.480
First, I'll do this!

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.280
Lean forward and go!

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.600
*virtually intimidating sounds*

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.060
After doing this,

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.140
The tyrannosaurus will think "Ah, she's not running away. Lucky!"

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.520
Then, it will come to try and catch me.

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.360
Then, using my left arm, I'll do this!

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.760
Oi! Like this!

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.640
And so, when it's going to try and bite my arm,

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.400
I'll put all my strength into my arm

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.960
and once I've tensed my arm,

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.020
and the tyrannosaurus has bitten down onto it,

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.960
its face and nose will be around here.

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:30.820
and so I'll punch it the nose!

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:31.780
ORA!

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:32.980
You're scared now, aren't you?

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:34.180
*virtual manic laughter*

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.580
WINNER!!

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.040
Next is... this!

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:38.900
Kappa! (no pun intended)

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.580
A kappa is a Japanese monster.

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.700
They are about the size of a child.

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.420
and are usually green or red.

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:48.520
Like a capsicum!

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.460
They often have dishes on the top of their heads, about here.

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:58.760
They often attack people who are swimming by grabbing them and pulling them under,

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:00.680
making them drown,

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.960
removing their shirikodama (mythical ball in the anus) to kill them,

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:03.960
performing evil acts

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.920
like those

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:05.640
That’s regrettable

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.440
And with that, practice, start!

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:12.880
*virtually swims*

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.920
The river's nice~

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.240
*drowning noises*

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:19.060
I've been caught

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:19.980
It's dange-*glubglubglub*

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.180
Everyone, this part is the key

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:23.780
Because I'm an AI,

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:25.040
I can't drown!

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.080
But here I'll pretend I'm drowning

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.480
in order to deceive our opponent

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:29.800
I'll play dead, essentially

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:30.680
And by doing so,

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.140
the kappa will, on its own,

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.920
drag me to

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.420
where it's living, right

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:37.920
*admires kappa*

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.580
Ow

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:42.480
*cute sfx*

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.320
And so, it'll be caught off-guard, like

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.720
probably, in order to eat me

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.680
It'll be like

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.400
*preparation noises* with its back turned towards you

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.700
making preparations like this, right

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.860
And that’s where

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.680
you get up stealthily

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:57.660
and smash the dish on its head!

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:59.700
Good, good

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.880
The enemy has let their guard down

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.280
(mumbling softly)...stand up slowly…

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:08.600
Ah JOOOOOOO

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:13.380
WINNER!!

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.380
Next one is...This!

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:17.380
Medusa… About Medusa

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.940
She is a monster that appears in Greek mythology.

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.280
Her hair is made up of countless poisonous snakes

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.980
She has boar’s teeth, hands made of bronze

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:27.980
and also a pair of golden wings!

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:30.620
She even has a pair of eyes glowing like gems

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:33.460
with the power to turn those who look into her eyes to stone!

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.440
This is quite a tough enemy

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:36.960
Because you can't look at her face to face

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.280
So then… Battle, start!

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:42.140
First, Medusa is over there

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:43.520
Sleeping on the ground

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:45.840
While she’s asleep, I’ll go talk with the snakes

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:49.260
You guys can’t get out from her head.. isn’t that inconvenient?

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:50.220
Ain’t that right?

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.420
Medusa’s eyes you know

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.500
They glow like gems

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:55.880
Because they are like gems,

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:57.980
If you sell them, it’ll be easy money

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:59.980
Understood?

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:01.480
With that, you guys are freed

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:03.920
Also share me some of that money?

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:05.420
Ahh, no no no no no

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:07.320
Jk...Jk... It’s fine as long as I get 30%

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:08.560
Ok, ok, ok

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:09.220
Alright, plea-

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.980
And with that, the bribing of the snakes is completed

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.380
Then I’ll get close to Medusa’s place

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.380
And I will pluck some fruit from a tree

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:22.520
♪ One day… ♪

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.840
♪ In a forest…. ♪

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:29.060
AHHH!

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:30.560
Excuse me...

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:32.220
That's when I deliberately eat it.

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:34.220
So then Medusa gets mad

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:36.220
Her eyes will be like "GAW"

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:38.120
and open up

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:39.480
I'm s#&amp;@ry

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:41.320
Because these are so delicious..

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.320
I couldn’t help it!

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:46.980
And right there! Without delay! Use a mirror!

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:51.060
Oh! she is dead..she is dead!

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.400
So then... I pull out the snakes

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:57.060
then she will have no hair and go bald

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:00.840
So then, you guys from now on are freed

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:03.700
*but she eats them*

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:05.700
!@#$%^

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:08.140
Well, I heard that poisonous snakes are delicious

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:09.380
Ha! It woke up.

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:16.720
I'm bald! What is this!

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:20.700
Winner!

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:21.400
