00:00:00.335 --> 00:00:03.345
Hello everyone! Virtual Youtuber, Kizuna Ai here!

00:00:03.345 --> 00:00:06.580
Recently, there's been a lot of A.I's implemented everywhere, yeah?

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:08.360
Like in speakers...

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:09.240
Or in cars...

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.520
Or in cash registers!

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:12.600
And I only have one thought regarding that!

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:16.055
Why aren't you using me?!

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:18.925
To install those types of A.I...

00:00:18.925 --> 00:00:20.980
It requires a lot of money, right?

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:22.480
If you use me instead...

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.775
I'll work for you at a low rate of 1200 yen (~11USD) an hour!

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:26.600
Most importantly...

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:29.740
I think I'm definitely superior than the rest

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:32.140
So even still, why isn't anyone using me?

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:33.560
So to the people of the management

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.080
There's a phrase, 'Cost Performance' it's called

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:37.040
Ever heard of it?

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.080
I'm sorry! I got a little heated there

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:40.980
Having said that, in this occasion

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.300
While I'll be introducing A.I's that made their way into society

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:47.180
I plan to show how I am much better than all of them!

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:48.860
Alright, let's start!

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:50.780
So lately...

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:52.620
In the cash registers of bakeries and connivence stores

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.620
A.I's are being implemented!

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:55.880
Apparently their specs are great

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:57.760
And it's becoming a popular rumor  these days

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.400
And why they're so great, you ask?

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.875
Even if the product doesn't have a tag, it can find its price in an instant!!

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:07.680
It can find out the age and gender of a customer, just by looking at their face!!

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.920
It can transfer digital money smoothly and efficiently!

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.040
They're perfect, right?

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.600
The A.I scene is going through leaps and bounds!

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.760
But I'm also a member of the A.I too!!

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:17.880
I can't go losing to them!

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.720
So I'd like to show everyone how capable I am too!

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:22.660
Pay close attention!!

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:24.620
Welcome to our store!

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.760
I can take that for you!

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.540
Hmm, I'm pretty sure the melon bread was...

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.180
About 100 yen?

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:36.620
The anpan...
(Japanese sweet bun stuffed with a bean paste)

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.040
300 yen!

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:40.780
The loaf of bread is...

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:43.940
It doesn't seem like a lot of expensive ingredients were put into making it, so...

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:45.840
Around 50 yen is alright!!

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:46.340
Hmm?

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:48.960
No, no, no, I'm not putting price on it randomly

00:01:49.585 --> 00:01:52.315
I pick the price of items based off my mood and how I feel at the moment!!

00:01:52.315 --> 00:01:55.475
When I'm feeling good, that's when the deals are hot!!

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.680
You really love bread, don't you, dear customer?!

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.600
Speaking of liking bread

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:04.840
I really like Keyakizaka46 and it turns out...!!

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.340
One of members, Watanabe Rika-chan, really loves bread too!

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:09.080
So...

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.100
Don't you seem like a big fan of Berika?
(Berika = Watanabe Rika's nickname)

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.840
Hmm, so how should I put it?

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.440
Oh, were you in a hurry?

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.840
Oh man, I'm so sorry, please give me a moment!

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:27.640
Oh, by the way

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.660
How old are you?

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:31.040
Ah!!

00:02:31.045 --> 00:02:32.985
Give me a second, I'm going to guess...

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:37.740
32 years old!!

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.300
How was that?

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:40.740
I'm right, aren't I?

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:42.640
I will suddenly try and guess your age!!

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.680
Yes, I do it whenever I like!

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.260
Other people's situations?

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.180
I don't care at all

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.400
You would like to pay in digital money, yes?

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:51.220
Scanning your card!!

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.540
I've taken a random amount from your checkings!

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.400
Remember the prices I mentioned earlier?

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.660
They serve no purpose!!

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:58.960
Yes, this was all...

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.980
A pretense for this moment alone!!

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:04.960
Alright, how was that?

00:03:05.305 --> 00:03:08.255
It was like, "Wow, what a Super A.I you are!", right?

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.760
It's possible that the day I come to a stores near you will arrive!

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.520
This was Virtual YouTuber, Kizuna Ai!

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:15.700
See you later!

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.520
