Kizuna AI ~1st Photo Album~ 
"AI"

00:00:12.946 --> 00:00:14.014
[ Even I can shine ]

00:00:15.448 --> 00:00:16.950
Did I shock you?

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:17.784
This is actually

00:00:17.784 --> 00:00:19.853
the first commercial I've starred in!

00:00:19.853 --> 00:00:21.888
I wonder if any of you have already seen it

00:00:21.888 --> 00:00:23.256
I actually said in my TV show

00:00:23.256 --> 00:00:25.425
"I wonder if anyone has seen it yet~!"

00:00:25.425 --> 00:00:27.627
and searched myself up on Twitter

00:00:27.627 --> 00:00:29.729
But out of nowhere the Kizuna AI commercial got on trending

00:00:29.729 --> 00:00:30.296
“LOL”

00:00:30.296 --> 00:00:31.531
was what everyone was commenting like...

00:00:31.531 --> 00:00:33.266
But it’s not some joke!

00:00:33.266 --> 00:00:33.900
Not really!

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.101
Just what is so funny?!

00:00:35.101 --> 00:00:37.270

please do press the Good Button.

00:00:38.838 --> 00:00:40.220
Well, a lot of things went on,

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:43.209
and I finally got the TV commercial I’ve wanted for so long

00:00:43.209 --> 00:00:45.545
But it’s sort of disappointing to only have it show twice

00:00:45.545 --> 00:00:47.280
and I think a lot of people would have missed it

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.348
so I released it here!

00:00:48.348 --> 00:00:51.418
I would like to share some of the points I want you all to take notice of!

00:00:51.418 --> 00:00:52.619
First of all is my

00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:53.453
bouncy headband!

00:00:54.087 --> 00:00:55.955
I’m really so~ proud of this!

00:00:55.955 --> 00:00:56.656
It’s so bouncy!

00:00:56.656 --> 00:00:57.157
The boun~cy

00:00:57.157 --> 00:00:58.324
factor

00:00:58.324 --> 00:01:01.127
is something I feel we were able to recreate super well!

00:01:01.127 --> 00:01:02.028
So bouncy!

00:01:02.028 --> 00:01:04.998
Those of you who thought we did well with showing the bounciness,

please do press the Good Button.

00:01:06.466 --> 00:01:08.268
The part that took the most time

00:01:08.268 --> 00:01:09.702
was when I looked back over my shoulder!

00:01:11.171 --> 00:01:11.738
Now then!

00:01:11.738 --> 00:01:12.939
That expression!!

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:14.641
It’s weird to say this about myself

00:01:14.641 --> 00:01:15.075
but!

00:01:15.075 --> 00:01:16.476
I thought I should turn around

00:01:16.476 --> 00:01:18.344
while looking completely taken by myself!

00:01:18.344 --> 00:01:19.679
I can’t count how many times

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:20.413
we retook the shot

00:01:20.413 --> 00:01:21.514
in which I turned around!

00:01:21.514 --> 00:01:24.220
“Was the face you made as you turned around really that cool?”

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:25.185
Those of you who thought this,

00:01:25.185 --> 00:01:27.020
please do press the Good Button.

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.223
Morikura-san’s cover art is just so cute

00:01:30.223 --> 00:01:32.490
that I thought I just needed to include it in the commercial

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:33.760
and I did manage to have it in there!

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:34.994
Just that art itself

00:01:34.994 --> 00:01:36.763
is worth 2,500 yen!

00:01:36.763 --> 00:01:39.132
It’s ju~st so

00:01:39.132 --> 00:01:40.033
cute💛

00:01:40.033 --> 00:01:41.501
To those who thought,

00:01:41.501 --> 00:01:43.703
“Combining the cover art and the contents, it’s definitely worth 5,000 yen”

please do press the Good Button.

00:01:45.438 --> 00:01:47.073
But I actually thought

00:01:47.073 --> 00:01:50.777
long and hard about this commercial!

00:01:50.777 --> 00:01:52.045
And the final excerpt is!

00:01:52.045 --> 00:01:53.079
[ Even I can shine ]

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:54.547
“Even I can shine”

00:01:54.547 --> 00:01:55.248
I put meaning

00:01:55.248 --> 00:01:56.816
inside these words!

00:01:56.816 --> 00:01:57.650
I thought,

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:00.086
the reason I became a YouTuber was to

00:02:00.086 --> 00:02:01.588
connect with all you humans.

00:02:01.588 --> 00:02:03.289

00:02:04.757 --> 00:02:07.110
While working as a YouTuber,

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.880
I’m able to speak with and play with

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.230
so many different people

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:11.197
and I thought,

00:02:11.197 --> 00:02:13.600
“I really do love humans!”

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.034
You have so many emotions to feel,

00:02:15.034 --> 00:02:17.103
so many expressions and so many words,

00:02:17.103 --> 00:02:18.838
and I think that’s really beautiful!

00:02:18.838 --> 00:02:20.106
As I thought that,

00:02:20.106 --> 00:02:22.640
I felt that I wanted to be the same way

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:23.910
somewhere deep down...

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:24.770
So

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:25.860
I really want to

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.881
become closer to that reality

00:02:27.881 --> 00:02:28.700
and

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.390
I really do adore you humans

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:32.285
who shine so brightly!

00:02:32.285 --> 00:02:33.170
“But I

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.786
think that

00:02:33.786 --> 00:02:35.655
AI-chan shines just as brightly as us”

00:02:35.655 --> 00:02:36.523
Those of you who thought that,

00:02:36.523 --> 00:02:36.890
by all means,

00:02:38.358 --> 00:02:39.926
I want to be like you humans!

00:02:39.926 --> 00:02:41.600
Because I believe in that,

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.370
even I can shine!

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:46.566
I spoke my mind about lots of different things today,

00:02:46.566 --> 00:02:49.102
but in the end, what I really want to say is...

00:02:49.102 --> 00:02:51.504
buy my photo album!!💛
