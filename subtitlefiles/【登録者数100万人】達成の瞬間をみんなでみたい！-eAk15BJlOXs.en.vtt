00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:02.380
Ah! Listen! Listen! Listen! Listen! Listen! Listen!

00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:04.840
Look! Look! Look! Look! Look! Look!

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:12.700
T-this! This! This is a real time counter that lets you know the amount of subscribers! Look!

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.740
A bit more! Within a bit...!

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.060
...A.I.Channel will reach...!

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:18.220
...1 million subscribers!

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:19.420
Isn’t that incredible?

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:19.980
Eh?

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.780
Finally! Finally!

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:23.360
It’s possible that...!

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:24.560
...This moment will arrive!

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.020
Man, I was always attentive to this, well...

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:29.120
...It’s like... I was so attentive to this, so much that...

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:31.000
...I couldn’t do anything else!

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.080
Well... well... now that this moment has arrived...

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.020
...I thought about recording a video...

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.640
...And now I’m recording, but...!

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:39.340
It's just that I’m really very nervous

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.540
Listen, look! Look! Look! Look! Look!

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.920
Eh? It's really amazing!

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:45.520
Eh? It's not a dream, right?

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.780
It's like when I surpassed 900,000 subscribers, I was like "Eh? How strange..."

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.080
I was so happy that I wasn't even sure it was real

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.300
I was confused and couldn’t grasp it at all

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.680
It's incredible... no, it’s... it's incredible...

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:58.880
Eh? Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.000
But you know... but you know... but you know...

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.200
It's not that it always rises but it also falls as well...

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.900
Aaaahhh...Ah! Man! If...

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.160
… I calm down and think carefully

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.820
Although I said 7.3 billion!

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:11.780
Well, well that's...

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.560
It's my grand dream, my grand dream is 7.3 billion, but...

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.080
...This, well, ah, you know...

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:17.340
How... how do I say it?

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.200
1 million people is incredible!

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:20.720
I want you all to think it carefully!

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.620
One million people, with that amount... you can make a city!

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:30.540
I’m now at the level of being able to become a Prime Minister in Japan! Really!

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.960
Listen, for that, it's really... surprising!

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.880
Eh? It's like... what...?

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:36.940
W-w-w-what...?

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.840
What should I do? Well...

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.500
I... what...? What...? It's not like I can do anything for it to keep increasing...

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:42.600
Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:43.760
Ah! Ah!
*Only 10 people left!!*

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:45.680
Ah! Ah! Aaahhhhh!
*Only 10 people left!!*

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:46.760
Incredible! Just a bit more!

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:47.560
Eh? What should I do? What should I do?

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:48.960
Let's see... let's see... let's see...

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.000
Let's see... let's see...

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:51.920
Let's see... to make use of the opportunity...

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:52.840
...I’ll talk about something international...

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:53.640
Let's see...

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.360
You know lately I've been hearing... what was it?

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:56.600
♪ This is me ～ ♪

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:57.100

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:59.120

♪ Nunununununununu ♪

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.520
Something like that!

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:03.640
Well, I don't know it very well!

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:04.480
Yes! Eh...!

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:06.120
AAAAHHHHH!

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.080
Ah! Ah!

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:09.800
It won’t go down? It won’t go down? It won’t go down?

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:10.940
Aaaahh! Listen!

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.240

*Surpassed one million subscribers!!*

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:14.660
*Surpassed one million subscribers!!*

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:15.800

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:17.600
Incredible!
*Surpassed one million subscribers!!*

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:18.660
Everyone!

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:20.360
All of you who come to always watch me...!

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.680
...And who are always encouraging me!

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:24.300
Thank you so much to all of you!

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:27.780
The words aren’t coming out now!

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.720
Wait a moment, I’ll calm down... breathe deeply...

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.980
*inhales*

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:36.260
Not like that!

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:37.000
Good

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:39.000

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:47.300
…I was capable of surpassing a million subscribers!

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.400
Really! Really!

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:50.600
Thank you so much!

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.540
A.I.Channel started its second year...!

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.960
... I'll have the goal of the "Kizuna AI Fes" festival...!

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:58.140
...And I’ll keep trying doing many more new things!

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:02.780
I plan to work hard even more to be able to fulfill the expectations of all of you!!

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:05.480
I’ll keep counting on you all from now on!

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:07.360
I’ll calm down

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:08.600
It's... incredible...

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.900
Good...

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:15.380
Lastly...

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.740
After all, we managed to reach one million subscribers

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.160
And it's possible that if it doesn't fall again

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.860
Let's see...

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.680
