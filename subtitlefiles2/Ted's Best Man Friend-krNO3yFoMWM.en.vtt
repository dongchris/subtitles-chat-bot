Hey Wes

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.660
You okay there? You look kind of stressed now. No, I'm fine. I'm just writing speech

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:28.930
speech for a- for what for ISA

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.720
No-no for Ted's wedding

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:39.759
You know best man's speech. I know it's kind of early, but I figure I'll start now I've never written one before oh

00:00:41.749 --> 00:00:43.749
Ok cool

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:52.359
So did tell already asked you [hMm]? Oh no not yet? But uh he will eventually oh

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.320
What makes you think that he's gonna ask, you?

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:00.880
Who else is gonna ask?

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.260
me

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:06.740
That's funny

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.740
No, Ted likes me more.

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:16.029
I'm a little bit bothered that wes would automatically think that ted's gonna choose him over me to be best man because quite frankly

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.089
Ted just likes me better. He's told me

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:21.909
Am I going to change the way I act around ted?

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:27.219
Hmm probably not just gonna be the same old me same old Phil

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.909
Hey, Ted. Hey Phil. I'm just so

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:42.390

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:49.960
to help you man

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:56.369
Cool by the way, like dance I can teach out a dance one two three. Why are you touching me? best man me

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.509
Know maybe later all right you got it. I?

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:10.409
Have this feeling that Phil is trying to take the best man title away from me

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:13.829
It's so sad because he doesn't even have a chance

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:17.339
I've known ted for 15

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.750
15 Days Longer than Phil

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:25.660
15

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:32.549
Days, Hey Ted I was at the mall today, and I thought of [you] so I got you something. Oh

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:36.539

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.200
sweater

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:56.920
Hey, Ted

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:02.699
So there's something really important you need to know for the wedding reception okay? What's that taking off the garter?

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:05.910
You can practice on me

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.490
No, go away. I can get a different color

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:18.630
Hey, Ted. How's it going over there? It's fine. You want to use those coupons now

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:27.780
No

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:34.190
I'm okay, actually I don't know what's going on, but phil and west I've been acting pretty strangely around me lately

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.999
It's really weird why do I think they're being so nice I?

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:40.760
Don't know, but it's about time

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:46.189

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.010
Actually, it's written in my name

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:51.170
