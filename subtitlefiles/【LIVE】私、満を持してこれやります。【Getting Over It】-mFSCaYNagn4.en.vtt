00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.220
Hello everyone! Virtual Gamer–

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:46.540
Just kidding~

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:47.280
*haha*

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.780
Hello everyone! Virtual Youtuber Kizuna AI here!

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.020
I did it!

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.020
*Ehehe*

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.670
*Hmhm*

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:56.090
That was too much...

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:57.790
That wasn't right, huh?

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:58.620
Alright!

00:00:58.620 --> 00:00:59.660
And so

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:01.080
Umm... today we will be playing the rumored...

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:02.640
What was it?

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:03.320
Pot

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:04.660
The pot

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:07.320
Today’s stream will be this!

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:07.980
"Don!"

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.680
Getting Over It

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.020
I know what you all want to say...

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:17.400
Especially,

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:18.590
"You're out of ideas"

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:20.400
"Don't you have any pride?"

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:22.460
Shut up!

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.040
I'll accept your criticism

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.060
It's true that everyone on Earth has played this game

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.100
...is what you may be thinking

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:33.540
But!

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:37.280
I have strategically timed this stream!

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.040
I just wanted to play too~!

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:40.170
Okay?

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:41.790
Pretty much

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.370
You guys are probably sick of this but

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:45.020
Oh! He's sliding down!

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.920
Oh, hang on

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.200
Good luck mister!

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.210
Oh he was hovering above it?

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:50.890
Like this...

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:51.590
Like this

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:52.830
To hover...

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:54.470
But yeah!

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:55.390
What was I saying again?

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:56.020
Ah

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.780
Just as you all were thinking, 
"I wonder if she played this?"

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.020
I'll be taking that opportunity~

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:03.540
Alright!

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:05.110
And so

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:07.730
It's good if I rotate it around like this, right?

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:09.190
Here we go~

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:11.790
This is- Oh, like this

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.610
Woah, just a little...

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.230
Before I started streaming

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.560
I tried this game out a little bit

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.730
And it's pretty difficult, huh?

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:24.690
In the beginning, for example...

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.850
You'll get sent back... if you fall

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:30.400
You come sliding back

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.190
That's no good...

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.950
Like this

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:34.730
Huh?

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:35.480
Like this!

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:36.240
AAH!

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:37.540
Wait a second...

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.620
I was doing so well before I started streaming!

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.680
This tree is...

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:46.980
Like this, with the tree...

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.200
Can't we just cut it down?

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:51.510
Can't we have it cut down?

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.960
Into lumber

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:54.930
"Ussha~"

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:56.890
Here we go!

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.300
How was I able to do it earlier?

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.870
Do this... and this, then...

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:02.450
Ah

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:04.290
I'm so close

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:05.470
With this, I...

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.010
Do this...

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:08.590
With this...

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:09.370
With this

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:10.070
Like this

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.920
This...

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:11.640
Like

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:12.500
Like *haha*

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:13.190
Like this!

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:14.660
Like this

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:15.860
I have to do this

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:16.630
Like this

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:17.410
Like

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:18.220
This

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:19.050
Umm

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.760
*haha*

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:20.980
*gasp*

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:22.190
Aaah!

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:23.550
Do this like...THIS!!

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:24.390
YEAH!

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:25.700
I'm a genius

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:26.480
*haha*

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:28.770
Next is

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:30.230
AAAH!

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:34.590
Here! Oh, that was good

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:35.410
Am I a genius or what?

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:37.440
Here we go!

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:39.970
Awesome

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:40.650
AAAH!

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:43.230
Here we go

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:46.230
I pretty much can't read comments today, seriously...

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:48.410
I'm going to do my best

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:50.840
To see how far I can get in 30 minutes

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:51.820
Here we go!

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:53.150
"Hai"

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:54.340
AAH!

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:55.730
"Waaah!"

00:03:58.540 --> 00:03:59.040
"Hai"

00:03:59.040 --> 00:03:59.710
"Ha"

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:02.980
Hmm?

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:03.940
Do this and

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:04.580
AH! Really?!

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:06.420
(babbling)

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:07.640
This is... wait

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:09.860
It's really unruly, huh?

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:13.140
This... is really relaxing

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:13.840
"HAISHO!"

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:14.360
"Uhu"

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:18.980
Ah! I thought I had gotten hold of it~

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:20.200
Like this

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:20.780
And this

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:21.340
Like

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:21.880
This

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:22.360
And

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:22.960
Like this

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:23.500
And this!

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:24.100
Like this!

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.720
This!

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:26.340
Like this

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:27.080
And this

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:28.610
LIKE- NOO!!

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:29.440
"...hikin"

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:29.980
"Uhu"

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:33.300
Use this

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:34.120
And do this

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:34.620
Like this

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:37.120
(frustration)

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:38.130
"ZZAISHO"

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:38.980
AAAH!

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:40.320
WAIT A SECOND!

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:41.790
This is irritating

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:42.500
C'mon

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:44.520
"Ueeeaaaah!"

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:47.970
Oh, that's good

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:49.980
Can you move a little more...

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:50.960
Ah? It's not holding on?

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:53.640
"Puruun~"

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:54.540
"Ushhhh ah-ah-ah!"

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:58.040
Ah, this is irritating

00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:59.090
Irritating

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:00.420
"Uisho! Oi! Ah!"

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:01.400
Oh! Yeah, yeah, yeah...

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:02.920
That's good. That's good

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.020
Ah! Wait! Why are you falling down?!

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:09.080
This is hard~

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:10.780
"HOOOO HA!"

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:12.020
Ah!

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:13.180
Damnit

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.920
Why? Why~?

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:17.540
"Mm buu"

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:18.720
(grunting)

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:20.130
Here!

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:22.040
What? Why did you bump into it?!

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:23.180
"Aaah"

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:25.140
Alright

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:25.930
Do this

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:26.440
Like this

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:26.990
And

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:27.970
Ah! Yeah!

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:29.260
That's good!

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:30.420
Next

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:32.140
Wait. Wait

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:34.190
...over here a bit

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:34.690
And

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:35.960
Like- "uh"

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:36.840
Like

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:37.980
AAAAH!

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:39.140
*gasp*

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:40.140
REALLY?!

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:43.890
"Uhu uhu"

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:44.780
*gasp*

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:46.300
Ah, here we go. Here we go

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:47.090
Here we go!

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:47.590
Ah!

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:49.230
Alright! That's good

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:51.130
That's good. That’s good

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:53.930
"Usshya"

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:56.050
Ah

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:59.980
Today's livestream is...

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:01.600
just...

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:02.180
I've got this!

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:03.480
YES! YES!

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:04.380
*haha*

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:06.550
I'm just

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:08.040
AAAH WAIT!

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:13.630
This video, no, livestream is just for fun, so...

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:17.680
"Uoooo"

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:18.580
Everyone...

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:23.840
Please bear with me. Livestreams like this 
are good sometimes too, right?

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:25.680
Right, Mr. Pot?

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:28.050
Ah, pft.

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:30.840
Mr. Pot~

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:31.800
Mr. Pot

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:33.360
"Usho usho"

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:34.080
"Usho"

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:34.880
This area

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:36.340
is peaceful looking

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:39.600
Oi! Wait! Wait! Wait! Mr. Pot!

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:43.180
Wait, why is he in a pot?

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:45.000
Did he lose a bet?

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:45.660
Ah! Just a bit more!

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:50.680
"Uisho"

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:51.720
"Uhu"

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:53.830
"HAI"

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:55.340
Alright! Ah

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.210
It's from here, huh?

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:01.000
"Yo"

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:02.520
Ah! Good!

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:03.760
AAAAH!! Wait!

00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:11.180
Wait, wait. Seriously, give me a break

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:15.710
"HAI"

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:17.240
"Hai, MAAAA!!!"
(Ma = What/Seriously?)

00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:19.350
Come on! Come on!

Ah! I'm doing it!

00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:57.920
Good! Good!

But what do I do here?

00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:00.880

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:48.980
I can't do this~

00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:51.400

00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:53.860
Aaah!

00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:55.240

Let's go!

00:08:57.270 --> 00:08:57.820
OH?

THIS

00:08:58.870 --> 00:08:59.420
IDIOT

00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:00.180
You moron!

00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:01.320
You're such an idiot!

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:02.210
"Gwaha"

00:09:02.210 --> 00:09:02.790
(sobbing)

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:04.050
Wait!

00:09:04.050 --> 00:09:05.850
Stop! Don't fall!

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:08.400
Please don't fall any further!

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:10.330
Alright, okay

00:09:10.330 --> 00:09:11.160
Deep breaths

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:14.320
"Iiiiii~"

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:15.080
*gasp*

00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:18.260
Ah...

GO!

00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:26.650
Ah, nope

00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:27.890
"Hoi"

00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:30.470
You can do this AI-chan!

00:09:31.130 --> 00:09:32.450
You can do this!

00:09:32.450 --> 00:09:33.240
"U u u"

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:34.560
"Oh ohoho"

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:37.220
I'm a bit stuck...

00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:39.160
Ah, I got it! I can do it!

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:40.150
"Ussho"

00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:41.140
I have returned!

00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:42.300
I'm alive!

00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:43.200
Ah!

00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:44.500
*gasp*

00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:46.280
Aaaaa! I don't want to die!

00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:46.920
Come on!

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:48.840
Ah! I've just got to get past this part!

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:49.630
Go!

00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:51.320
Keep going! Come on!

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:52.860
Go! Please! PLEASE!

(babbling)

00:09:56.090 --> 00:09:57.040
Oooh

00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:58.000
Hah...

00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.660
Alright, let's take a break here

00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:00.310
Hah...

00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:01.410
Ah...

00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:02.830
Hah...

00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:03.600
Ah...

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:04.910
Ahaha...

00:10:05.710 --> 00:10:06.600
Aaaah!

00:10:08.810 --> 00:10:09.870
I'm tired

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:11.400
So tired...

00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:13.550
Even though A.I. don't get tired

00:10:13.930 --> 00:10:14.870
I'm tired...

00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:15.880
Let's keep going

00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:20.020
This, what am I supposed to do here?

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:24.390
Wait, wait. Please don't fall. C'mon

00:10:25.130 --> 00:10:27.030
PLEASE NO!

00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:28.180
"Uissho"

00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:29.360
Huh?

00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:32.770
That doesn't work

00:10:32.770 --> 00:10:34.080
What do I do from here?

00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:35.720
I can do this?

00:10:37.390 --> 00:10:39.020
Slowly. Drop down...

00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:40.160
Then

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:43.960
I have to move the hammer down here, right?

00:10:43.970 --> 00:10:44.670
Like this

00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:46.550
WAAAAAIT!!!

00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:48.620
Are you serious?!

00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:52.080
Tell me you're joking!

00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:53.000
AAAH!

00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:54.340
(babbling)

00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:55.600
Ah!

00:10:58.630 --> 00:10:59.610
With your mind's eye...

00:10:59.610 --> 00:11:00.500
Oh

00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:00.980
Oh!

00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:01.840
Catch it!

00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:02.490
Come on!

00:11:02.490 --> 00:11:03.230
Please

00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:04.890
I've got this, I've got this, I've got this

00:11:04.890 --> 00:11:05.670
*haha*

00:11:09.270 --> 00:11:10.650
There! Uh? What?

00:11:10.650 --> 00:11:13.530
How do I do that really good 
jumping motion from before?

00:11:13.530 --> 00:11:14.240
Alright!

00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:16.280
"Uuu?"

00:11:18.290 --> 00:11:19.860
I'll do this...

00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:21.570
And this...

00:11:21.970 --> 00:11:22.650
Go!

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:23.960
Ah!

00:11:26.030 --> 00:11:27.420
This is really hard!

00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:29.580
"Osshya"

00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:30.360
"Osshya"

00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:32.080
Things are going well

00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:33.480
Ah, this doesn't work

00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:34.180
I have to do it from-

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:34.740
AAAAH!

00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:36.080

Come on!

00:11:37.390 --> 00:11:38.250
I give up

00:11:38.650 --> 00:11:39.510
Ah

00:11:39.510 --> 00:11:40.540
Wait a second

00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:42.060
Just climb this bit

00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:43.090
Just this little bit

00:11:43.090 --> 00:11:43.970
"Aesshyo"

00:11:43.970 --> 00:11:45.640
AAAAH! Wait! Come on, seriously?

00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:46.670

00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:49.460
Let's rest... up here

00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:50.960
Ah...

00:11:52.830 --> 00:11:53.820
Hah...

Umm...

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:00.620
Everyone!

00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:02.470
Lovely weather we're having

00:12:02.930 --> 00:12:04.240
My name is Kizuna AI

00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:07.400
I

00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:11.080
I'll continue in... ten minutes

00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:12.220
Ugh

00:12:12.810 --> 00:12:14.100
I'm tired

00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:18.050
[ Put the hammer below you and push off ]

00:12:18.050 --> 00:12:19.340
Push off? How do I do that?

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:21.360
"Unn"

00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:23.900
Push off the ground?

00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:24.570
Ah!

00:12:25.210 --> 00:12:25.820
Like this!

00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:30.400
Push off the ground?

00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:32.500
What does that mean?

00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:34.960
Hover over the hammer and... push off?

00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:35.860
I can't do it?

00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:36.750
Oh?

00:12:36.750 --> 00:12:37.390
Hmm?

00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:40.580
He's saying "Uuu"

00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:41.350
"Uisshyo"

00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:42.540
AH!

00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:47.480
(babbling)

00:12:47.490 --> 00:12:48.500
Eh?! Eh?!

00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:49.880
Give me a damn break!

00:12:51.430 --> 00:12:52.580
This guy!

00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:53.240
Arg

00:12:55.930 --> 00:12:57.120
No!

00:12:57.120 --> 00:12:58.050
This isn't right! *haha*

00:13:00.020 --> 00:13:00.890
(grunting)

00:13:00.890 --> 00:13:03.740
"Bu, bueee"

00:13:03.740 --> 00:13:04.470
Ah?

00:13:06.190 --> 00:13:06.970
How do I do this?

00:13:06.970 --> 00:13:07.470
This

00:13:07.650 --> 00:13:08.080
Here

00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:09.200
AAAAAH!

00:13:10.270 --> 00:13:12.010
Ah, seriously? Come on

00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:15.790
You're just making fun of me now~

00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:17.730
Hah...

00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:20.090
Clearly

00:13:20.090 --> 00:13:21.790
It's all Mr. Pot's fault

00:13:22.290 --> 00:13:22.790
Yep

00:13:24.050 --> 00:13:24.900
Ah~

00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:27.690
Ah~

00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:29.890
How is everyone?

00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:32.620
How are you?

00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:34.520
I am...

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:36.760
Not... doing well

00:13:37.090 --> 00:13:37.810
Yep

00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:39.520
Um...

Everyone...

00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:43.690
How are you doing?

00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:45.770
How are you doing?

00:13:48.020 --> 00:13:48.980
Let's see here...

00:13:50.430 --> 00:13:51.710
[ You can do it AI-chan! ]

00:13:51.710 --> 00:13:52.630
Thank you

00:13:54.150 --> 00:13:55.810
I'm full of determination!

00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:58.880
I wonder how much further there is to go...

00:14:00.110 --> 00:14:01.730
I'm full of determination!

00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:05.260
This is a 24-hour marathon

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:06.420
Let's go!

00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:07.920
Just kidding

00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:10.980
I couldn't do this for 24 hours

00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:11.750
No~

00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:12.450
Please

00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:14.640
Aah, nice one, man

00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:15.620
Aah! Hey!

00:14:18.670 --> 00:14:20.670
Keep trying Mr. Pot!

00:14:21.510 --> 00:14:23.090
Let's do this and

00:14:23.090 --> 00:14:24.090
Like this!

00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:25.660
Oh. Like this?

00:14:25.970 --> 00:14:27.020
Do this

00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:28.970
And this

00:14:29.310 --> 00:14:29.910
Here

00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:31.440
Ah!

00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:32.670
I feel like I'm supposed to use this

00:14:32.670 --> 00:14:34.070
Ah, nope

00:14:34.070 --> 00:14:35.240
Do this?

00:14:36.810 --> 00:14:39.350
Do this and

00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:41.890
Like this

00:14:41.890 --> 00:14:42.530
There

00:14:44.490 --> 00:14:46.510
How do I jump?

00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:48.530
Like this?

00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:49.550
And this!

00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:51.290
That's the opposite of what I'm trying to do!

00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:54.240
[ Do your best AI-chan. I hope you're doing well! ]

00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:54.900
Thank you!

00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:55.780
I'm doing great!

00:14:55.780 --> 00:14:56.630
"Usshyo"

00:14:56.630 --> 00:14:58.300
This isn't good

00:14:58.840 --> 00:14:59.760
Um...

00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:03.670
I wanted to keep going at that pace

00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:07.980
NOOOOO!

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:10.840
"Hai"

00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:11.340
"Hoi"

00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:12.180
"Hoizo!"

00:15:13.130 --> 00:15:13.800
"Hoizo!"

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:14.780
Ah!

00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:15.420
"Hoizo"

00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:16.220
"Hoizo"

00:15:17.050 --> 00:15:18.090
(grunting)

00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:21.650
Just climb up old man!

00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:22.490
Look

00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:23.520
Do this

00:15:24.330 --> 00:15:25.160
Like this!

00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:26.440
Come on!

00:15:27.090 --> 00:15:28.230
Come on~!

00:15:28.230 --> 00:15:29.960
You suck at climbing!

00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:31.530
Here

00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:32.680
Like this

00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:34.380
Hang on. I need to...

00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:37.120
"MAAAAAAAA!!!"

00:15:39.660 --> 00:15:41.900
Ah~ are you kidding me?

00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:44.080
Seriously

00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:46.370
Seriously

00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:47.680
Go!

00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:48.300
Oh–

00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:50.180
Use this and

00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:51.890
Do this

00:15:51.890 --> 00:15:52.660
Here!

00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:53.270
Oh!

00:15:53.270 --> 00:15:53.850
Oh

00:15:53.850 --> 00:15:54.250
Oh–

00:15:54.250 --> 00:15:55.030
AAAAH!

00:15:55.030 --> 00:15:56.620
Why did you let go?!

00:15:56.620 --> 00:15:59.140
Why did you let go?! You stupid old man!

00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:02.500
"Hoi!"

00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:03.090
Ah

00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:05.580
"Hoi!"

00:16:05.730 --> 00:16:06.360
"Hoi"

00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:11.240
And then

00:16:12.130 --> 00:16:12.670
"Hoi!"

00:16:12.670 --> 00:16:13.010
"Hoi!"

00:16:13.010 --> 00:16:13.320
Ah!

00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:14.390
NOOO! NO! NO!

00:16:14.390 --> 00:16:15.450
"Eueueue"

00:16:15.450 --> 00:16:17.390
Come on old man!

00:16:17.390 --> 00:16:18.430
Oh! That’s good!

00:16:18.430 --> 00:16:19.060
Good job man

00:16:19.060 --> 00:16:19.900
AAAAH!

00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:21.200
It's over... It's over...

00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:22.270
It's over...

00:16:22.270 --> 00:16:23.480
I'm finished

00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:25.030
It's over...

00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:29.600
It's started playing sad music

00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:32.800
Calmly...

00:16:34.150 --> 00:16:34.650
"HAI"

00:16:34.810 --> 00:16:35.390
Ah.

00:16:37.050 --> 00:16:38.400
Mr. Pot

00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:40.220
Like this...

00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:41.200
Spin it around

00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:42.820
Like a fan

00:16:42.820 --> 00:16:44.600
Yes. You are a fan

00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:46.450
Fans can fly!

00:16:46.450 --> 00:16:47.640
They can't? Oh.

00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:48.850
Fans can...

00:16:49.170 --> 00:16:50.000
Fly?

00:16:51.810 --> 00:16:53.040
Calm down and...

00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:54.500
With the heart of Buddha...

00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:55.920
Do not waver!

00:16:57.050 --> 00:16:58.310
Here we go

00:16:58.310 --> 00:16:58.990
Nope

00:16:59.670 --> 00:17:00.980
I wonder if I should move this way a little bit

00:17:03.740 --> 00:17:05.190
Come over here

00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:06.440
Then...

00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:10.450
Show me how cool you are!

00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:15.320
AAAAAH!

00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:20.980
Let's practice jumping down here. How do I do this?

00:17:20.980 --> 00:17:22.120
I do this, right?

00:17:24.020 --> 00:17:25.570
Hmm? How? How?

00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:27.620
How am I supposed to jump with this?

00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:30.120
I can't jump very well...

00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:32.860
I can't fall in love
(unTL-able joke)

00:17:36.020 --> 00:17:36.940
"Nn"

00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:38.480
Wait, let's calm down

00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:40.590
I can't do it without calm nerves

00:17:41.670 --> 00:17:42.520
"Hai!"

00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:43.570
3...2...1...

00:17:43.570 --> 00:17:44.210
Ah.

00:17:44.210 --> 00:17:45.700
I can't reach it~!

00:17:49.190 --> 00:17:49.840
Oh!

00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:50.560
AAH!

00:17:52.910 --> 00:17:53.440
Oh!

00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:55.200
That's good!

00:17:56.800 --> 00:17:57.840
You can do it old man

00:18:01.300 --> 00:18:02.500
What do I do here?

00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:08.040
Maybe if I do it a bit more forcefully

00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:10.760
Ah!

00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:11.210
Nah

00:18:11.210 --> 00:18:11.700
Nope

00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:12.500
Old man

00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:14.120
Do this here and...?

00:18:14.130 --> 00:18:15.050
AAAAH!

00:18:16.110 --> 00:18:18.280
I want to push off from here

00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:19.120
Like this

00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:19.460
Here

00:18:19.460 --> 00:18:20.740
Aah! Wait!

00:18:20.740 --> 00:18:22.030
That almost worked, right?!

00:18:22.030 --> 00:18:23.310
Ah! Old man! Just now...

00:18:23.310 --> 00:18:25.400
That was so close, dumbass~

00:18:26.430 --> 00:18:27.450
With this...

00:18:27.450 --> 00:18:28.670
"Nnnn bu"

00:18:29.620 --> 00:18:30.720
Do this...

00:18:31.060 --> 00:18:31.700
Here!

00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:33.110
"Ah– oueih"

00:18:33.110 --> 00:18:34.920
Ooooh, I was flying!

00:18:35.850 --> 00:18:37.120
I was flying just now, huh?

00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:38.090
Ah! Finally–

00:18:38.090 --> 00:18:39.520
Aaah! Wait, stop!

00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:42.860
Stop, stop~

00:18:42.860 --> 00:18:43.910
"Uissho"

00:18:43.910 --> 00:18:44.830
Finally!

00:18:44.830 --> 00:18:46.300
I managed to dance my way over here

00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:47.320
"Osshaa!"

00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:48.520
That's good!

00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:50.890
I finally made it back here~

00:18:51.330 --> 00:18:52.040
"Ah"

00:18:54.540 --> 00:18:56.020
"Haa~"

00:18:56.500 --> 00:18:59.680
This is one of those "never-night 
ending-mare" situations…
(TL: Unsure why she pronounced it this way)

00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:01.780
You're not very easy to control, old man

00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:03.440
Like this...

00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:07.080
Let's sit down here...

00:19:07.770 --> 00:19:09.270
No, Mr. Pot~

00:19:12.970 --> 00:19:14.100
How do I do this?

00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:15.370
Aaah! Stop, y-you–

00:19:15.810 --> 00:19:16.650
You're seriously–

00:19:16.650 --> 00:19:17.220
AAAAH!

00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:17.880
Really

00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:18.380
Fuck

00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:18.920
Ugh

00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:19.990
C'mon

00:19:19.990 --> 00:19:21.890
WHY~?

00:19:24.110 --> 00:19:25.070
Here we go!

00:19:25.070 --> 00:19:26.000
"Aissho"

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:27.730
AAAAH!

00:19:27.730 --> 00:19:28.610
I can't take this anymore

00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:30.050
I want to sleep

00:19:30.050 --> 00:19:31.000
Can't I be done?

00:19:31.830 --> 00:19:33.000
I've had enough

00:19:33.350 --> 00:19:34.860
Ah, I'm tired...

00:19:35.430 --> 00:19:36.420
Ah~

00:19:37.780 --> 00:19:38.920
Ah~

00:19:39.930 --> 00:19:40.800
Hah...

00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:44.570
What we need in the middle of the night is–

00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:46.910
Cute girls, huh?

00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:48.760
Ah~

00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:52.160
Alright!

00:19:52.820 --> 00:19:54.050
Umm...

00:19:54.870 --> 00:19:56.300
I'm tired, so–

00:19:56.990 --> 00:19:58.120
I'm going to–

00:19:58.850 --> 00:19:59.910
Read comments, okay?

00:19:59.910 --> 00:20:02.260
And communicate with you guys!

00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:04.310
Until my energy comes back

00:20:06.270 --> 00:20:07.280
Let's see...

00:20:08.410 --> 00:20:08.920
Exactlya

00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:10.420
I'm done with this old man

00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:13.960
You guys–

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:15.540
Ah, but this guy has...

00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:18.930
A pretty good body, though

00:20:18.930 --> 00:20:22.260
So you don't become like this useless old man...

00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:23.540
And old people watching:

00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:24.590
Everyday– Ah.

00:20:24.590 --> 00:20:25.840
Do your best!

00:20:26.470 --> 00:20:28.610
This really isn't working

00:20:28.610 --> 00:20:31.210
How much map is there?

00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:35.220
"Hoissho"

00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:39.120
"Ah-ah~"

00:20:40.780 --> 00:20:42.580
Y'know, this game is frustrating, but–

00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:45.160
It's pretty addictive

00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:47.800
Do this...

00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:48.690
Like this..

00:20:49.010 --> 00:20:49.510
And

00:20:49.510 --> 00:20:50.250
C'mon...

00:20:50.250 --> 00:20:51.120
There!

00:20:52.150 --> 00:20:52.920
Come on

00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:54.370
"Uweeh"

00:20:54.370 --> 00:20:55.080
"Uweeh" (up)

00:20:55.830 --> 00:20:56.330
Do this...

00:20:56.590 --> 00:20:57.060
And

00:20:57.060 --> 00:20:57.780
This

00:20:58.310 --> 00:20:59.190
Umm

00:21:00.870 --> 00:21:01.370
Like–

00:21:01.370 --> 00:21:03.840
AAAH! This sucks!

00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:04.960
"Heeh"

00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:06.510
I say no, but I'm still playing

00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:08.140
"Haaa~"

00:21:08.140 --> 00:21:10.430
Did I say I was going to read comments?

From America? Oh! Thank you!

00:28:02.590 --> 00:28:04.270
"AI-chan I love you!"

00:28:04.270 --> 00:28:05.120
Thank you

00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:07.390
I love you all too!
(friendzoned)

00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:08.820
"Good evening"

00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:10.410
Let's see here

00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:11.840
Ah

00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:12.960
Bouquet toss!

00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:14.240
That, uh, that–

00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:15.640
Everybody's all dressed up and

00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:19.660
It's like, "I WILL GET MARRIED NEXT!!! YEAH!!!"

00:28:20.100 --> 00:28:21.010
Right?

00:28:24.100 --> 00:28:25.330
"I got some anime merch!"

00:28:25.330 --> 00:28:29.480
Getting merchandise from your favorite 
stuff is great, isn't it?

00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:33.600
What made you happy today?

00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:35.430
"Hello hello hello!"

00:28:35.430 --> 00:28:36.260
"Hello~"

00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:38.560
Let's see

00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:39.690
"I woke up this morning."

00:28:39.690 --> 00:28:40.950
Um, yeah!

00:28:40.950 --> 00:28:43.080
It's bit of an everyday thing, but still!

00:28:43.510 --> 00:28:44.460
Right?

00:28:44.460 --> 00:28:47.420
Knowing that you are alive– in this moment –is important!

00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:48.860
Happiness, yeah

00:28:50.540 --> 00:28:52.140
You successfully asked someone out?!

00:28:52.140 --> 00:28:53.000
Oooooh!

00:28:53.140 --> 00:28:53.450
Eh?

00:28:53.450 --> 00:28:54.160
Everyone–

00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:55.540
How, how–

00:28:55.540 --> 00:28:56.760
How do you ask people out?

00:28:56.760 --> 00:28:57.290
Eh?

00:28:57.290 --> 00:28:58.340
Call them over?

00:28:58.890 --> 00:29:00.180
Or write a letter...

00:29:00.180 --> 00:29:01.310
Or call them on LINE

00:29:01.310 --> 00:29:02.620
But that might be–

00:29:02.620 --> 00:29:04.740
I wonder if stuff like email and LINE...

00:29:05.320 --> 00:29:07.240
Is too simple?

00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:08.850
But it still gets your heart racing, right?

00:29:09.550 --> 00:29:10.070
Eh?

00:29:10.070 --> 00:29:11.370
What's it called...

00:29:12.340 --> 00:29:13.600
Like, "Hi!"

00:29:14.760 --> 00:29:16.280
"Actually..."

00:29:16.280 --> 00:29:19.060
"It's been bothering me for a while now, but..."

00:29:19.060 --> 00:29:19.820
Ah, but that is–

00:29:19.860 --> 00:29:22.280
Wait, wait! The ones that really sound like 
they work are those ones right?

00:29:22.900 --> 00:29:25.080
Where you're already a little bit close

00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:29.380
And you start talking, and you're like "So I like this person..."

00:29:29.420 --> 00:29:30.600
"Hmm? Who is it?"

00:29:30.610 --> 00:29:32.760
And you're like, "It's a secret~"

00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:34.460
And they're like, "Hm? Is it someone I know?"

00:29:34.460 --> 00:29:36.620
And you're like, "Yeah, you know them"

00:29:36.620 --> 00:29:37.350
Right?

00:29:37.350 --> 00:29:38.000
Like

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:40.750
And they're like, "Come on, tell me~"

00:29:40.750 --> 00:29:41.410
Then!

00:29:41.410 --> 00:29:42.820
You're like, "It's actually..."

00:29:42.820 --> 00:29:45.460
"I like you, so-and-so"

00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:46.760
Ahaha~!

00:29:47.260 --> 00:29:47.820
Ha

00:29:48.740 --> 00:29:51.500
Confessing like that is the meaning of youth!

00:29:51.500 --> 00:29:53.600
I'm talking like an old man!

00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:55.220
Am I okay with this?

00:29:55.320 --> 00:29:59.760
"I'm happy that I got to see your livestream today!"

00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:00.960
Oh! Thank you!

00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:04.380
It's like, "Actually..."

00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:07.650
"I've liked you for a while now"

00:30:07.650 --> 00:30:08.700
Hmm~

00:30:09.660 --> 00:30:10.490
Hmm, okay

00:30:10.490 --> 00:30:11.780
Just because...

00:30:11.780 --> 00:30:13.380
Today's closing statement is:

00:30:15.540 --> 00:30:16.520
"Actually..."

00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:19.120
"I..."

00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:20.530
"Like you!"

00:30:21.220 --> 00:30:22.680
Ha! As if~!

00:30:23.180 --> 00:30:26.080
Alright! This was Virtual Youtuber, Kizuna AI!

00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:27.280
See you next time~ &lt;3
