So the plan for today's video is... this! \"Video ideas that were scrapped because they seemed boring, but let's do them anyway because it's end of year festival~!\"\" In order to upload videos to YouTube I need to come up with lots and lots of ideas And among those many ideas... There are some that are... not really... Some... Some boring ideas... Come up as well..!! Well, isn't just coming up with them amazing? So! These children of mine... We're going to go and do them today! Alright, let's go~! \"Scrapped ideas revelation!\" \"If I stumble on a word, video immediately ends!\" For a super high-spec A.I like me Nothing is impossible! So... I'm going to say some tongue twisters! Alright If I stumble on any word... The video instantly ends!! Red wrapping paper Blue wrapping paper Yellow wrapping paper Red wrap- wrap *completely fails* A.I.Channel! \"I tried to do a A.I.Channel style musical\" Music... Start! ♪ I am Ai ♪ ...Hmm? ♪ Heh- heh, hmm~ ♪ Wait... ♪ Ten, te, ren, ten ♪ ♪ Ten, ten~ ♪ Um... ♪ Tu, tu, ru, tun~ ♪ Hehehehe... Uh-eh? The song changed... Uh... Run.. ru- ♪ My name is Ai~ ♪ Ah, the song just ended... Ahahahaha What do I do with this?! Impromptu singing is impossible!! ♪ Tu, run.. tun... ♪ ♪ I am Ai~ ♪ Hmm? ♪ Pa, pa.. pu tuun... ♪ Ahh... I don't- want- want to.... hmm? Hmm? I don't even know this song!! It's impossible!! \"Let's come up with something to replace rock-paper-scissors!\" Do you know rock-paper-scissors? People all over the world do, don't they? Whenever there's a dispute... Rock! Paper! Scissors! Like that When I went to the event I even did it with everyone who came to see me! And so... I want to come up with something like that! Rock... and go!! ...The same? Mmm... Rock-paper-scissors... Ai-chan? Random Word Generator? Easel...? Pfft And so... I was thinking for 5~6 hours, but... Nothing!! \"Ai-chan the assassin!!\" I started with the title And was thinking what kind of video to take, but... Ti.. tle... Assassin? Yes When I was came up with this... I might have been irritated Right! So... It's the end of year, so who cares! ..And so I've presented the scrapped ideas! If you're coming up with ideas all day by yourself Even if you're a super A.I You sometimes think... \"What does interesting even mean?!\"\"))]"
