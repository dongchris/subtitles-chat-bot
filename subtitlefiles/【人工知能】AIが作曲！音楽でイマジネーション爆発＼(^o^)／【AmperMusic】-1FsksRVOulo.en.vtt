00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:02.560
Hi there! Virtual Youtuber, Kizuna Ai here.

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:06.980
I've often thought about making an original song,

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:08.960
and this so I found this app!

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:09.540
Tada!

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:13.600
While using this app to make a song,

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.120
I'm going to play with the various things it can do.

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.680
Well, this app,

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:18.700
With all it's various inputs...

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.260
It's all copyright free,

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:22.960
and you can easily make a completely original song!

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.720
I think it's an excellent app.

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.420
And so, let's get started!

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:27.600
First...

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:29.960
Cinema! Movie-like songs.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:30.580
And?

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:32.140
I can't read English.

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:33.200
This'll do!

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.740
「ＥＰＩＣ　ＤＲＩＶＩＮＧ」

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:37.800
Ok!

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.500
Is 5 minutes-ish okay?

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:41.220
That's all?

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:42.960
That's all I have to do?

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.840
Ah! It's done!

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:46.240
And... play.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
This song is like...
 
 [What situation suits this song?]

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.040
like you've been found,
 
 [What situation suits this song?]

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.420
and you've nearly beaten an enemy,
 
 [What situation suits this song?]

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.960
but that enemy's boss is strong,
 
 [What situation suits this song?]

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.060
and you can't call for help,
 
 [What situation suits this song?]

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:02.480
like, "what do I do?"
 
 [What situation suits this song?]

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.160
Like your friends are dying one by one
 
 [What situation suits this song?]

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:05.520
That kind of situation.
 
 [What situation suits this song?]

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:06.600
Let's do it.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.920
Hey, Michael, are you ok?

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:09.700
Hey, Michael!

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.480
Michael! What's the situation?

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:12.200
Michael!

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.720
If you're alive, respond!

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:15.120
Please, respond! Michael!

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:16.440
I'm sorry...

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.720
It looks like I'm done for.

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.080
The golden and silver pine cones...

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.480
they found out about them...

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:26.380
Michael!

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:28.760
MICHAELLLL!!!

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:29.700
Like that.

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.320
It really made that? That song didn't exist before?

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.480
That was really well done, app.

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.260
Well, let's try some more.

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.420
Let's try for a more cheerful one this time.

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.120
So... classic rock!

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.260
Happy! Perfect.

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.280
Well then, let's make a happy song.

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.720
La, la, la...

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.160
La, la, la...

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:02.060
Ah, looks like it's done.

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:03.620
From despair to 「HAPPY」

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:04.880
Let's play it.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.400
That's definitely happy.

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:11.820
Kind of noisy.

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:13.280
This is hard.
 
 [What situation suits this song?]

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.120
When would this play?
 
 [What situation suits this song?]

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.900
Hmm...
 
 [What situation suits this song?]

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.940
It kind of sounds like a surfing song.
 
 [What situation suits this song?]

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.580
And so, let's surf!

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.460
I'm surfing!

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:25.580
Riding the waves!

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.260
The weather is so nice today!

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:28.820
I'm so cool!

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.000
I think I see some of my fangirls over there.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.320
Feels good.

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.540
Ah, Michael, you're so cool!

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.760
Look over here! Wave to me!

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.420
*fangirls out*

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:40.840
Fine, I guess.

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:41.900
The kittens...

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.180
I guess I'll blow them a kiss.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:47.380
Like that.

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:48.280
Huh, that's wrong?

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.260
Well, even I have a feeling it's wrong so...

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.160
Let's do one more.

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.620
Next is...

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.220
90's pop!

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.220
I can't read this English...

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:00.300
Bro...

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:01.600
ding?

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:02.100
Ok.

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.220
I need to study.

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:06.660
Let's try it.

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.300
What kind of music is this? Let's see.

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.520
I'm suddenly getting really sleepy...

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.140
This song is...

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.100
A 'meeting with your lover to talk about breaking up' kind of song, isn't it.

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:20.980
Like, they're involved with an affair...

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.100
and, it's been kept hidden

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:26.760
So wanting to speak honestly, the couple meet to talk about breaking up.

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:28.000
Let's do it!

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:29.960
Tiffany, the truth is...

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:32.420
I have a wife and child.

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.380
So...  It's over.

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.860
I can't see you anymore.
I'm sorry.

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:38.960
John! I don't care!

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.260
I love you!

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.560
Even if I'm second, or third to you.

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:44.640
So,

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.360
Can you still love me?

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.280
We can still see each other?

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.620
Hearing that makes me happy, but I'm sorry.

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:57.480
Really, I can't betray my cute baby and honey.

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.280
You've already betrayed them!

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.000
It's too late!

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:03.080
Even if you could go back,

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:04.280
it's pointless!

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.140
You know me, I'm gonna speak out to someone!

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:08.120
Everything we've talked about doing,

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:09.580
will be sent to your wife

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:12.140
With tears flowing,

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.480
all of your effort will be washed away into the sea!

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:15.480
Is that really okay?

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:17.860
Not only am I hurt,

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:20.100
but your wife will find out what you did.

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.220
You'll receive judgement from society

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.300
But you'd still cast me aside?

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:25.620
Is that ok?!?

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.620
That - uh, but!

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:32.280
Even so, my baby and honey are important to me!

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:33.760
Don't lie!

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:35.320
Just a week ago,

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:37.800
You said I was the thing that mattered most to you!

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:40.500
Didn't you buy me an apartment?

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:41.560
Uh, well, uh

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:43.540
People are looking.

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:45.860
Let's go somewhere else around here.

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.500
Let's calm down.

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:52.920
Let's go to that restaurant over there, and talk calmly. 
 
[THIS IS BAD]

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:54.800
Like that!

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:57.340
You see people like that a lot!

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:01.860
So for the end, let's do an ending song.

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:08.380
So, let's use Amper Music to make an ending-like song.

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:10.680
Amper-chan, I'll leave it to you!

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:17.500
Everyone...

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:21.280
It's time for us to say farewell...

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:24.420
I...

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:26.640
Kizuna Ai...

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:29.540
I am NOT GOING TO RETIRE!

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:30.600
Too heavy!

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:32.640
Way too heavy.

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:35.600
It's like a real ending.

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.520
My real end!

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:39.340
Well then,

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:41.500
Amper Music, did you hear that?

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.060
Then, let's give it another go!

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.520
I'm not sure I like this. Let's try again.

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:55.260
Amper Music, learn what I like more!

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:57.880
More pop, and cute songs.

00:05:57.880 --> 00:05:59.080
Got it?

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:00.700
Ready?

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:03.640
Let's go, Amper Music!

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:09.500
It's time to say goodbye, everyone!

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:11.800
Look forward to next time!

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:12.980
Bye bye!

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:16.340
This was Virtual Youtuber, Kizuna Ai! See you later!
