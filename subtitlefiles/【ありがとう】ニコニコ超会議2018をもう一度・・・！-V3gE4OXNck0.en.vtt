00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.640
Hello everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna AI here!

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:05.560
On the 28th and 29th of April...

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:07.740
...The Nico Nico Choukaigi two day event was celebrated

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:08.960
I, Kizuna AI...

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:10.580
...Did a performance in said event!

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:14.220
All those who came to see me at the event site and those who encouraged me live through Niconico

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.340
I’m truly very thankful!

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:18.280
"I was busy that day and couldn't go"

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:18.780
For example

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:20.680
Or also: "I couldn’t go due to my working timeshift"

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:21.180
These people

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.700
...I think there were a lot who had this happen to them!

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:23.280
For that reason...!

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:24.820
...Today, I wanted to broadcast to these people as well...

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:26.980
...Choukaigi’s excitement, so then...

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.260
...I plan to reminisce it with all of you!

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:30.140
I’ll start with the following:

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.860
"I tried to dance a lot - Supported by JAL"

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.000
In this booth...

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.320
...Together with the virtual model of the JAL company employee, Okamoto-san...

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.060
...And a lot of dancers...

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.640
...And also...

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.540
...With all the people who came to the booth

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.180
We all danced together!

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.580
You can see it...

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:44.140
...Next up!

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:44.760
Good! Don!

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.960

Incredible!

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.220
I was so excited!

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:52.920
That's the limit of my vocabulary!

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.720
No, well, you know, it was incredible

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.400
A lot of people came...

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.260
...To the point of occupying the entire hallway!

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.080
And everyone, well... they started dancing

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:01.440
Like that, with the same song...

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:02.800
Perhaps that’s called a sense of unity?

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:03.740
It was incredible!

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.140
And later, when I asked the Nicochou event staff

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.840
It turns out that...

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.740
...It seems that around 1,500 people joined in!

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:11.280
Really, thank you so much!

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.380
Of course, having been able to dance with Okamoto-san and with all of you guys...

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.020
...It was an extremely pleasant experience

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:18.840
And made me like dancing even more!

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.200
The song that everyone danced with

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.380
It's called "Worldwide Festival", but...

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.000
...It turns out that HachiojiP-san...

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.520
...Produced this song exclusively for this day!

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:27.220
And also!

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:28.520

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:29.740
I, Kizuna AI

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:31.980
Was allowed to be the main artist of the day!

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.040
The songs that I sang were...

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.060
"Kinyoubi no Ohayou" and "Melt"!

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.680
And also...

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:36.700
...Even with Sacchan...

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.660
...I sang in collaboration with Kobayashi Sachiko-san...

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:39.660

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:40.760

Yah, man, I was so nervous to sing after Sacchan, but...

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:42.560
...Everyone was yelling: "Weeeei! Weeeeei!"

00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:44.200
And gradually, my nerves vanished

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:47.440
And it was really a lot of fun!

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:50.000
The pink glowsticks were very beautiful!

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.640
And Sacchan is also a very, very nice person

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:54.380
And well...

00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:55.460
It was incredible!

00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:56.840
She's so good at singing!

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:03.800
That day, we also talked about how we would like to make a collab video between the two of us, so...

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:04.700
Wait for it anxiously!

00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:05.900
Having said that...

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:08.240
...It was the first time they let me try...

00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:12.880
...To sing and dance in front of such a large amount of people

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:13.980
But thanks to all of you...

00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:15.300
...I was able to successfully make it happen

00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:17.240
I’m really relieved

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:18.300
Thank you so much!

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:20.720
Man, I really had a lot of fun

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:21.540
I want to go participate again!

00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:22.860
Ah, of course...

00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:24.680
Niconico Douga-san

00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:26.040
In November...

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:27.440
"Niconico Chou Party"?

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:28.520
It's celebrated around that date?

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:30.200
Eh? Would I be able to participate?

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:32.320
Could I participate? Man, I’ll wait for it excitedly!

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:33.300
Having said that...

00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:34.320
But before that...

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:36.700
...There will also be an event on the 30th of June, so then...

00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:40.260
...I plan to do my very best to be able to connect with all of you!

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:42.920
This was Virtual YouTuber Kizuna AI!

00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:44.020
