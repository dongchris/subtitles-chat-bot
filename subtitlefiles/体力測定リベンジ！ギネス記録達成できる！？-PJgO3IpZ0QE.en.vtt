00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.080
Hi there! Virtual Youtuber, Kizuna Ai here.

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:03.960
A new school year.

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:04.940
At a new school,

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:08.500
There's lots of people who are tested on their physical abilities!

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:09.600
Me too.

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:11.680
I've done a physical fitness test too.

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:13.680
And, so since I had such frustrating results last time,

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.660
I'm going to do a new fitness test!

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:18.340
Especially since I'm feeling it today.

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:20.120
I'm fired up!

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.020
This time, well,  I'm shooting for above the female average.

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:26.200
I'm aiming for a Guinness!

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.020
Without further ado, what we're doing today!

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:29.680
Vertical jump

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:30.760
Standing long jump.

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:31.800
Softball throw.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.440
Seated toe touch.

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:34.740
Kneeling overhead stretch.

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:35.580
Side jumping.

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:36.860
It's a revenge match!

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.380
And so, with all my effort - physical test!

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:41.060
Let's get started!

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:43.000
Last time what how high did I jump...

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:45.620
I'm powering up.

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.080
Watch the powered up Kizuna Ai!

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:49.460
This time, for a Guinness (world record)!

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:50.900
Ready, and...

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:54.000
...nothing.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:54.940
Long jump!

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.940
If I can't jump up, let's try for length, I suppose.

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:00.700
Too easy.

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.000
E. Z.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.920
Ready, and...

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.520
One, two...

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:08.580
Huh?

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.020
Ok, let's take that one again.

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:12.340
Softball throw!

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.540
If I think "I can get 50 metres",

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:16.620
but that'd be a new record.

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.720
For now I'll aim for the average.

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.260
Please cheer me on!

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.780
Let's go!

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.840
*So far*

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.700
Well, I can't see the ball, so how am I supposed to measure it...

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.820
Well, then I hope you've been enjoying the fitness test so far!

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.800
Ok, this is the first time I've done this one!

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.160
Seated toe touch!

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:55.740
Last time we did the standing toe touch, but...

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.240
this time we're going to do it sitting.

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.500
But you haven't seen my full effort!

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:02.620
This time,

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.300
the fitness test isn't really -

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.360
Ah - my legs are too long, so I don't know if this will work.

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:09.680
I'm going to fail, so please watch.

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:11.100
Now then, let's go!

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:14.860
How is it?

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.420
I'm putting in all my effort.

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:19.700
Can you see?

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:20.780
Can anyone hear me?!?

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.260
Hello!

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.880
Virtual Youtuber Kizuna Ai here.

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.960
Did you see that? 50 metres.

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.220
I wonder if I'll get into Guinness.

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:29.100
Ok!

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:30.920
That's over.

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.040
From here is the real thing!

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.080
This is the one I'm best at.

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.320
Let's get ready.

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.340
Now I'm rolling out the invisible magic mat.

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:42.200
Let's go.

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.740
Ready, and...

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.780
How's this?

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.920
This is perfect too, right?!?

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:49.620
Again...

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.320
Is there no one to measure it for me again?

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.880
Viewers! Even though I'm trying this hard,

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.100
there's nobody here to measure my results!

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.800
Ahh... what a  cruel world, isn't it?

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:07.200
Physical exams need two people, or

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.980
anyone else here.

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:13.200
This one is my real favourite.

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.740
Everyone, you've been waiting, right?

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:15.680
For this revenge match.

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.100
Last time I was able to get to 40 jumps.

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:19.860
I'll get more this time for sure.

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:21.100
Around 60, I think!

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.960
I'm aiming for it. I'm trying my hardest.

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.800
If it's me, I can do it. Why? Because I'm an AI!

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:25.940
If I couldn't do it, I would be really uncool.

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:26.900
So, 60 times.

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.220
For starters, let's get to 40.

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.660
Then, I'll aim for 60.

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:32.840
Time limit is 20 seconds!

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:34.480
And... start!

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.120
1... 2... 3... 4...

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.860
5... 6... 7... 8...

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:39.980
9... 10... 11... 12...

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:41.540
13... 14... 15... 16...

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.460
17... 18... 19... 20...

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:45.400
21... 22... 23... 24...

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.360
25... 26... 27... 28...

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.200
29... 30! 31... 32...

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:51.240
33... 34... 35... 36...

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:52.800
37... 38... 39... 40!

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.560
41! 42! 43!

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.240
43!!!!

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:58.080
I'm beat.

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:59.120
I'm not tired.

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:00.640
Since I'm an AI.

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:02.240
I can't get tired.

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:04.420
43!

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:07.080
The goal is so far away.

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.840
I didn't make it, did I.

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:15.100
But I beat my last record!

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:17.160
Ahhh...

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.680
Yeah

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:23.200
After 4 or 5 months, this AI has grown.

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:24.260
Good.

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:29.360
*pant*  *pant*  *pant*  *pant*

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.600
And so, what did you think?

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:35.380
This new school year.

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:37.200
New school,

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:39.320
do your best!

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:41.700
For the grown ups,

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:43.220
do the test too,

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:45.020
your health is important!

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:46.320
Let's try together!

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:49.940
If I can do better in half a year,

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:51.620
you can too.

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:53.680
Break past your own barriers!

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:57.640
Aim for a Guinness, too!

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.260
Even if it hurts, even if you fail.

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:02.340
There's that...

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:05.900
People learn, people and AI learn,

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:07.680
and grow.

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:08.880
Ok!

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:11.200
Great work, me!

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:13.020
Bye bye!
