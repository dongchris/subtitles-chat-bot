00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:05.920
Hey, everyone! It's me, the modern-day Messiah, Kizuna Ai!

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:09.920
Today, I'll be talking about that thing everyone might have forgotten about.

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:11.700
You know, that thing from kindergarten.

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.880
Do you guys remember from a few episodes back?

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.360
The one where I did Brainwars.

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:21.140
Well, I mentioned something like this.

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:27.320
"Well, you know. Just in case, you know, like the one-in-a-million chance that I lose,

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.700
I'll instead show you guys this new thing I've been working on.

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.420
It's a special, just for you guys!

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.080
Well, I said that but I did win, right?

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:38.820
I did win.

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.240
But... I'll do it anyway

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:48.460
You know, I've been working on this new thing for a while now.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.200
I mean, I did practice it, after all.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.860
And thinking of new material for this channel...

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:59.120
It's not exactly easy, you know!

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:04.060
And thus, the youtuber's enigma gains depth

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.760
*slice*

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.340
Anyway, it's about that time of the year where people like to party and do banquets.

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.940
For those of you that have some seniors that might not be the most considerate

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:19.920
and tell you to "liven the place up" during some gathering, this is for you!

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.600
I'm hoping that you'll remember this video!

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.360
With this video, everyone'll have an act up their sleeve for the new years party!

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:27.900
Get it!

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:33.720
You might think this is super lame or that it's not right for you...

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.340
None of that matters!

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:37.520
None of that matters!

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.100
'Kay, oppappi! (Kojima Yoshio's catchphrase)

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:42.360
Starting to get warmed up?

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.960
We're still just getting started!

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.280
This was a response on Yahoo Answers to

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.720
"What's the lamest way to confess my love?"

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.060
It went something like this.

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.380
Your eyes...

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.400
They're reflecting a man that's drowning in love.

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:00.980
You know...

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:03.180
The only person that can save him...

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.040
Is you.

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:06.580
That just gave me diabetes!

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:09.540
Anyway, moving onto my main topic!

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:13.900
Jokes that will get people laughing around the world!

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.060
Hello! It's me, Kizuna of the World!

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:25.680
I'll now start counting from one, but act crazy whenever I get to a multiple of three or a number with three. (A famous gag by Katsura Sando)

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:29.860
One! Two! Three!

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.580
Four! Five! Six!!

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.100
Seven! Eight! Nine!!

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.080
(Continues counting)

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:52.540
Twenty-three!! Twenty-four... Twenty-five!!

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:54.500
Wait...

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.920
But anyway, I'm sure you guys can do this, too!

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:04.180
Involve everybody around you! Spice up the atmosphere!

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.500
And now for my last act...

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.160
Like I promised earlier in the video, I have something I've been practicing for everyone!

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.860
Please listen!

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:20.340
I'll give you a special soup~

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.300
It's warm!

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:30.060
It's got the aspirations deep within my heart mixed in!

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:39.380
Everyone's smiles are as radiant as the sun for me

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:46.400
I hope everyone keeps me company for a long time~

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.000
And with that, everyone's year-end party should be a breeze!

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:52.720
What's going to be a breeze, you ask?

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.300
I mean, doesn't being this prepared give you confidence?

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:58.920
It's important to just do it!

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.680
Your spirit is what's important!

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.480
It's a beautiful sight to watch someone give it their all!

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:08.260
It is cold nowadays, so make sure to not catch a cold!

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:09.460
Bye-bye!
