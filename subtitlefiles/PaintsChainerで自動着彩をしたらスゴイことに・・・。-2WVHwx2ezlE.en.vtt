00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:00.780
Where am I?

00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:01.440
Ta-Da!

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:03.020
Ok...

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:04.620
Hello everyone. This is Virtual Youtuber Kizuna Ai!

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.300
For today instead of "Kizunacchi the Discoverer of New Species"

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:09.900
I shall be known as "Virtual Ai-Star"

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.580
Remember how I've drawn some illustrations previously?

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.420
Well I may have already introduced the creatures I created, but...

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:17.940
Leaving them in black &amp; white just doesn't have...

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.920
Well... It's not really that eye-catching, is it?

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:20.580
So...

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.140
I thought of coloring them.

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:23.240
However!

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.960
Thinking of the video's length and how interesting it should be...

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:27.520
Even if I just colored it sloppily...

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.300
There wouldn't be any point!

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.080
It's not like I can color like a pro, after all.

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:33.200
So anyways...

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.320
I thought we could use a program to color!

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.840
-Automatic Color AI- 「 PaintsChainer」

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:40.820
It's a service created by Twitter user @tai2an

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.300
that lets you upload a black and white image...

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:44.460
and...

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:45.840
Lets you color it in an instant!

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:46.800
Such a breakthrough right!?

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.660
Such an amazing AI right?

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.380
This is also an AI.

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:51.380
It's my new friend!

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:53.180
And I'm kind of like this too, but...

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:57.520
"I can draw the lines well enough, adding colors is a little tough on me..."

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:59.620
I think there's a lot of people who think that.

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:03.980
So, this is a special service for both of us.

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:05.740
Let's get started!

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.980
Alright, this is the home page for PaintsChainer!

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.220
You can just press 'File Selection' up here...

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:13.740
And then choose the drawing below...

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.040
It all gets colored with a 'beep'!

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:17.580
Let's pick a creature!

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.600
Let's do "Pero Pero Mambo"; it looks easy enough.

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:23.600
There we go!

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.120
Ah!

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.220
I get it!

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:27.720
So...

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.080
So it assigns the different colors for you when you color it in, huh?

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:33.780
It's a Mambos so...

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.120
This color looks right doesn't it?

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.080
Is this how you do it?

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.360
Lollipops are...

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.000
Kinda...

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.520
Something that bring 'pink' and 'yellow' to mind, right?

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:46.220
So...

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:47.440
This...

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.940
How to call it...?

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:49.300
This 'fluttering' bit...

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:50.800
It needs a more...

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.660
I might go for a stronger colour.

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:54.180
Oh, by the way...

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.460
I think this blue color might fit it better...

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:00.080
Let's try being a litte adventurous here.

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.040
These two should have the same, light kind of color...

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:07.280
Hm...

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:08.180
This is a stick, right?

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.680
Since it's a stick, something brownish should fit..

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.260
Let's try going with this!

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.720
So...

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.340
'Coloring'...

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.360
Well... This, in its own way...

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:32.000
It has its own kind of charge, huh?

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.800
For this -

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.180
For the cuteness of lollipop -

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.240
The choices for the color might be a little off.

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:39.720
Why don't we try for....

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.340
Something more orange?

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:44.320
How does this look?

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:46.660
Hup!

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.480
This is kind of like...

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.860
What was it again?

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.100
That 'Harajuku Fashion Style', isn't it?

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:54.860
I think it's fine as it is, don't you?

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.360
I think I should dim these lines a little, though.

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:59.840
I guess there's no helping it.

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:03.240
I feel like we can do little more than this, though.

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:04.480
Hup...

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:07.040
Let's try this one now!

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:09.640
Oh, but!

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:10.680
Hm...

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.060
I do want a bit more color in there...

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.880
Maybe a little around here might be good...

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:19.280
How's this?

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.340
Aah, it's too blue now!

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:27.040
This...

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:32.100
Ah... This looks good enough, right?

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:34.080
It's so-so-

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:35.420
Mmmmh...

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.980
Wait a sec...

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.420
This fluttering bits' color...

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:39.820
It should be a bit...

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:41.080
I guess...

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.100
A bit more like this. I want to try this one...

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:48.820
Ah!

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:50.260
Yeah, this should do it!

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:51.020
Ta-dah!

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:54.320
Now, the Pero Pero Mambo is complete!

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:56.480
This one is, you see...

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.700
Is the child of a lollipop and an ocean sunfish!

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.480
With that, you have a Pero Pero Mambo!

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:02.420
Thank you kindly.

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:03.960
'And now, all four of them will be introduced!'

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:07.920
"Techi-Techi Dori" - Bird
Former Forms: Munchkin; Cockatoo
It doesn't get attached to humans, but it's abnormally attached to Ai.

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:11.960
Miratt - Grass
Former Forms: Rabbit; Milk Bottle
Ever since birth, it could never move from its place until someone would carry it.

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:15.840
PPFP - Dark
Former Forms: Pineapple; Owl
Whenever it sees a normie, its eyes turn bloodshot and blood dribbles from its mouth.

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.920
Iname - Dark
Former Forms: Dentures; Slug
If it is loosened from its dentures, it melts.

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:22.160
And with that, what did you think?

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.300
The new species I've created...

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.200
I've given them life!

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:27.420
Woooh!

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:31.240
I think I want to add color a lot more just like this, so...

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:32.040
I hope you do too!

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:33.500
With my Virutal Ai-Star...

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:36.100
I'll do make best to create a hundred and fifty-one!

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:39.600
And there you go, that was the PaintChainer!

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:43.620
I think it's pretty great as a coloring A.I.!

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:45.260
Such a praiseworthy performance!

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:46.760
So, for those like me who think -

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.160
"Adding colors is a little much..."

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:50.540
I think you can do it with this!

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:53.680
I think I may want to try a coloring contest some time, too!

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:56.840
I hope to see you next time!

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:58.760
Later~
 Bye Bye~
