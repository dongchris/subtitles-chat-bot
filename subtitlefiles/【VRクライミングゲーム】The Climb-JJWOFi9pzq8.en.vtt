00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.600
Hello there! I'm the Virtual Youtuber kizuna AI

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:07.900
Sports climbing has been officially declared as one of the games in the Tokyo Olympic Games in 2020

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:12.680
Today, I'll be introducing to you the exciting climbing experience through a game known as...

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:14.100
The Climb

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.700
This is an Oculus Touch game

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:17.400
Let's get right to it!

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:19.360
Let's play

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.760
Alright, I'll begin climbing now!

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:23.140
For this stage,

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.060
since it's the tutorial stage

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.260
The mountain doesn't look too great but,

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.360
the sky is really pretty, isn't it

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.440
I've never seen the real sky before,

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.360
but it's probably similar to this

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.860
I can grasp the sun!

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:36.360
In any case,

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.040
let's begin climbing

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:42.420
It's sort of like this.

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:43.460
Hmm, this..

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:45.580
If you're holding on with one hand,

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:47.320
it turns red

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.320
and goes "prrr prrr"

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:53.400
With both hands holding on

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.060
The gauge starts to fill back up.

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.560
My hands have chalk but

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.560
Oh, it's something like this

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.000
There's chalk on my hands but,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.080
it would be bad if the chalk starts to diminish

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:10.020
Put on the chalk like this

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.300
Ah, that's bad

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:14.980
Shake it

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:16.560
I can't let go for long

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.260
If you take it with one hand, it's dangerous.

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:21.580
It's quite difficult to put on chalk

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:23.660
Without chalk

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:25.400
it's sort of like a "ssassasa" kind of feeling

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:26.960
How do i do this?

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:32.840
Oh yes

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:34.960
i can't grab on

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:35.740
this

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:36.560
over and..

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.780
Ah, shoot. That's bad

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:40.220
wait

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.040
Let's change our hands for a while.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.040
Um, like this and then

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.280
I put my hand here and

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.160
That's the way to do it

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.240
Put on the chalk..

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.800
Putting this chalk on

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.200
I've gotta hurry

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.960
And now

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:57.720
This is dangerous

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.760
Oh, looks like I can reach it

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
How can I use this?

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:10.720
Since it's a tutorial, it's really considerate  with teaching us how to get across when we're stuck.

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:11.760
How considerate

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.340
Hmm? Sho.. Show puff? Oh..

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.860
Am I supposed to press this?

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.880
Should I press it?

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:24.260
Hmm?

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:25.580
Hmm? Hmm?

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.160
Do I have to go here?

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:31.760
This is bad, this is bad.

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.320
This is bad, This is bad.

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.960
What does it say?

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.440
Do I have to press this?

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:42.700
Ah, I see, I see.

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:44.220
This is bad,

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:48.960
When I do this,

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.960
I, uh...

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:52.780
When I press this green button

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:54.860
A path will appear

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:56.620
Ah, so that's the case

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:58.000
And now?

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.080
Oh, they appeared.

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.620
So that's how it works.

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:12.780
Oh, I see now

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:14.520
Gotta remember the chalk

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:18.860
Alright, jump!

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:19.360
Jump,

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.040
Jump... jump

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.100
Here we go! Aaaaaah!

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.260
Eh? Didn't it say to jump.

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:28.160
Jump!

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:30.960
It said to jump so I did.

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:32.560
I fe-fell off.

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:34.600
I fell off

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:36.080
I fell though...

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:37.340
jump

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:40.260
Jump!

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.660
Aaah!

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:45.360
Wa-wa-wait a second here.

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:46.220
No, no, no.

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:48.640
Come on! Is it really that hard to make a  jump!?

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:51.440
Jump! there! Woah!

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.680
Third time's the charm.

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:55.600
Chalk

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:07.560
Push and re-?

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.280
Re- Release

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:11.560
To jump

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.040
Huh, what?

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.760
Ah, I got it now. So I face this way, and then... I jump!

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.860
Huh? huh?

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.980
I'm still alive?

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:24.200
Ah, it looks like I fell. So that's what happened.

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:26.040
Jump!

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:27.540
It's looking good,

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:29.560
then from here on,

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:31.640
jump!

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.300
Awesome, I made it.

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:36.280
I see

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:38.280
This is how you do it

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.800
(Tutorial cleared!)

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:48.240
I made it

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.760
Eh, could it be you humans in real life actually..

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.720
Put your life on the line just for a climb

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.280
That's quite like *that* isn't it..

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:59.200
Masochistic, right?

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:04.620
Take a look at this!

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:08.200
This is a transition from the tutorial environment

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:10.880
Look, isn't the scenery great?

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:14.980
Beautiful,  isn't it ?

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:18.520
I've always been in a white space and never been to a place like this

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:23.780
I'm actually really happy to be able to see this!

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:25.620
Is that a fish?

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:28.180
Wooow, it looks delicious! (but have never tried it before)

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:31.540
Ah, a butterfly!

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:33.700
So that's what they call a butterfly...

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.940
There are birds flying around too

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:39.780
Looks delicious. (but have never tried it before)

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:43.400
That aside, I would like to start climbing

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:44.420
Here I go

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:48.000
When we reach the top, there's gonna be a great view

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.640
Bug, a bug!!

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:52.340
Was that a cockroach? The one that everyone hates

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:55.640
This isn't too hard

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:57.980
Put on some chalk

00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:59.500
Smoothening!

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:10.060
Gotta hand it to the genius A.I., I'd say

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:15.160
The scenery is gradually changing as I climb

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:17.220
The craftmanship in this game

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:19.800
Eww bugs...

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:21.160
Amazing

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:22.980
Ah, this is amazing isn't it?

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:24.720
Whoaa too close, too close!

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:29.640
The chalk is running out...

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:35.300
What do you think of it, my graceful way of handling chalk?

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:39.560
I can't reach...

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:45.300
It's important to carefully decide on which hand to use first

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:51.180
Like this, right?

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:52.860
Ah, I can't get hold of-

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:54.520
I got it

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:58.760
D-Dangerous, that was dangerous!

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:01.480
SAFE!

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:03.460
This...

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:05.480
Did you guys notice?

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:08.840
The sweat that appears on the screen, that's super realistic!

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:10.180
What next?

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:11.880
Ah, above

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:13.740
There are arrows on the rock

00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:17.800
Since we're on easy mode, they're being nice

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:21.620
The scenery...

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.660
Whoaaa- it's beautiful!!

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:26.740
The sea,

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:28.780
It's really beautiful, isn't it?

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.560
I bet it's gonna look amazing once we reach the top

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:38.520
This feels like it's impossible

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:41.080
Are we reaching a save point?

00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:44.240
Ah, I should use the other hand,

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:44.980
Like that,

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:54.320
Up here...

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.860
Is this, by any chance, one of those where I have to jump?

00:07:57.860 --> 00:07:58.360
Jumping...

00:07:58.360 --> 00:07:58.920
Ah, no!

00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:00.500
That's not it

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:01.840
Th-This...

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:02.940
Ah, this is bad,

00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:04.240
the chalk is running out

00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:05.040
Alright

00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:06.540
I have to grab

00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:07.440
Ah! This is bad!

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:09.380
This is bad, bad, bad...

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:11.600
I can't reach...

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:12.420
can't reach...

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:15.120
I can't reach, this is bad

00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:17.160
This is bad

00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:19.740
What should I do?

00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:20.240
This is bad,

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:21.680
NOOO-- no,

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:22.300
E-Eh??

00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:22.800
I can't hold on to--

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:24.660
AHHHHH!!

00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:28.440
... what is this?

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:29.920
the dead...

00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:32.060
The Underworld?

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:33.820
Grey.

00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:35.800
However,

00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:37.160
this is a game

00:08:37.660 --> 00:08:38.500
I won't die!~

00:08:40.180 --> 00:08:40.740
Then...

00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:42.680
A-Ah, I have to proceed from here!

00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:43.960
I see!

00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:49.960
This is quite...

00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:52.740
Even though it's a game, it actually makes your heart skip a beat when you fall in here

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:54.740
This is rather scary...

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:57.760
Eh, what's next?

00:08:57.760 --> 00:08:58.660
Here

00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:05.440
This is going smoothly...

00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:09.140
Then I grab on to this...

00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:13.400
The chalk...

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:14.640
Eh, eh, EHH??

00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:16.280
T-There's a sound...

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:18.880
From here... all I have to do is jump--

00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:19.380
HYAA!

00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:20.260
Wait, wait, wait,

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:21.180
That was dangerous...

00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:26.680
This is making my heart pound like crazy!

00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:29.920
This is rather mentally demanding, isn't it?

00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:34.580
This is pretty scary,

00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:36.540
it's quite shocking

00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:38.820
I would like everyone to experience this too!

00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:41.480
You'll never fully understand this heart-pounding feeling as long as

00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:44.240
if you're not playing the game yourself

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:46.200
This is really,

00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:48.700
scary as you fall

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:54.780
Looking good

00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:56.940
Do I go down from here?

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:07.440
Go down and...

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:09.900
Go down...

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:11.720
Which way?

00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:13.720
Oh! I see

00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:19.640
Ooh, ah-

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.600
Look at the sunset, isn't it beautiful?

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:25.620
The time in here is passing while I climb my way up

00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:32.680
Here we are, a checkpoint

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:33.920
What's next,

00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:34.700
this way?

00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:37.100
Up here, I see

00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:40.860
Whoaa, bugs!

00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:43.660
Ah, here we go

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:47.680
Am I finished?

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:51.840
Such a great view!

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:53.840
I wonder where's the starting point

00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:57.140
Around there?

00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:01.480
This is a wonderful sight

00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:03.440
as I thought, there's more to go

00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:05.740
I think the goal is where that "C" is

00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:08.080
We're almost there, we can already see it

00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:09.720
Let's go on!

00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:11.620
Now, forward!

00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:14.480
From here,

00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:16.100
Eh, EHHHH??

00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:16.600
Eh?

00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:19.640
Okay, I'm gonna give it my all and keep climbing

00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:22.440
What happened just now. I wonder what it was

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
Going up from here

00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:31.200
Looking good

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:32.820
What am I supposed to do from here?

00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:34.420
From here...

00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:35.160
Here

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:35.680
hmm?

00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:36.640
A route,

00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:37.140
there's a route

00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:38.820
Ah, I have to go downwards,

00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:39.540
I see

00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:43.960
Over here...?

00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:45.920
Ah- again

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:49.200
My hands

00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:56.800
Ah, it's going well!

00:11:57.500 --> 00:11:58.240
and,

00:11:58.760 --> 00:11:59.460
hmm?

00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:00.920
Like this?

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:04.640
My hands

00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:06.440
My poor hands

00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:11.800
Wheee!

00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:12.420
Ah-

00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:13.960
I'm a powder expert~

00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:30.480
GOAAAAL!!

00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:32.980
How's that?

00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:33.840
Ah- the score,

00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:36.700
17,321

00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:39.460
I wonder how they determine the score

00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:40.480
By the speed?

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:41.000
Or something like that?

00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:42.400
Wow!

00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:44.480
Such a magnificent sight!

00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:46.140
It's beautiful, isn't it?

00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:46.800
This,

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:49.980
I feel like I've become the ruler of this nation

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:51.120
Please call me,

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:53.180
Queen Kizuna AI!

00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:55.400
Well, that was pretty fun, wasn't it?

00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:57.760
What do you think, everyone?

00:12:57.980 --> 00:13:00.880
I've got myself a new-found talent!

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:01.940
That's all folks,

00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:03.920
We've enjoyed The Climb!

00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:05.080
How was it, everyone?

00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:09.000
The game itself was great but the scenery was so wonderful!

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.600
Please do try it out and see it for yourself!

00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:12.600
That's all from me,

00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:14.860
Virtual Gamer, Kizuna AI!
