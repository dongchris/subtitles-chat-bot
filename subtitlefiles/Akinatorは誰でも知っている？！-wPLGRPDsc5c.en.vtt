00:00:00.256 --> 00:00:02.880
Hello! I'm the Virtual YouTuber, Kizuna Ai.

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:05.370
These days, I've been called a toaster,

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.870
or having a weak database.

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:10.190
But Kizuna Ai is an AI!

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:13.790
As an AI, I want to do more AI-like things

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:16.410
and introduce those to everyone!

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.920
I've collaborated with Rinna and SIRI so far.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.320
Today, I will bring over an AI just like one of those!

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:29.160
Actually I knew about it like from your comments from Twitter.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.440
Let's introduce him.

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.010
His name is...

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:33.560
Akinator!

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:37.150
Akinator is an AI who will ask questions

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:41.240
and guess what you're thinking!

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:45.080
Let's see what this Akinator's got!

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:49.960
Let's see if he can guess my BFF, Rinna!

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.960
Question one.

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.680
Does it exist in real life?

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.130
Exist in real life...

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:56.384
It does!

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.160
It became famous from the internet?

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.970
Oh!

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:02.960
I think so, because it's an AI.

00:01:04.047 --> 00:01:06.368
Does it do Minecraft Let's Plays?

00:01:06.768 --> 00:01:09.920
I don't think Rinna plays Minecraft.

00:01:12.528 --> 00:01:15.088
She doesn't do Let's Plays.

00:01:16.352 --> 00:01:17.824
It has three eyes!

00:01:18.704 --> 00:01:19.680
No!

00:01:21.344 --> 00:01:23.610
It is the group's moodmaker.

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:24.270
Hmm.

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.208
I think,

00:01:26.208 --> 00:01:28.200
she's the troublemaker.

00:01:29.216 --> 00:01:30.740
YouTuber?

00:01:31.024 --> 00:01:33.770
I don't think Rinna does YouTube.

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:34.704
No.

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.480
A member of a five people group?

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:40.912
She's not.

00:01:42.688 --> 00:01:45.400
She had shot a sexy video.

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:46.528
Did she?

00:01:47.232 --> 00:01:48.620
Huh?

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:50.140
What to do with this?

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:51.392
I don't know.

00:01:52.095 --> 00:01:54.160
She's not a boy.

00:01:55.888 --> 00:01:58.064
Her name is written in hiragana.

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:00.960
She doesn't have anything to do

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.464
with music.

00:02:03.552 --> 00:02:05.920
She shouldn't have appeared in movies.

00:02:06.384 --> 00:02:07.168
Shouldn't have.

00:02:08.288 --> 00:02:09.400
Her hair...

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:10.720
Rinna's hair

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.060
is straight, isn't?

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.320
Maybe.

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:16.320
No.

00:02:19.456 --> 00:02:20.512
Black hair?

00:02:22.336 --> 00:02:23.360
Uh...

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.024
I don't know.

00:02:25.968 --> 00:02:28.912
She doesn't have anything to do with Nico Nico Douga.

00:02:30.592 --> 00:02:31.472
It's long!

00:02:31.472 --> 00:02:33.470
Maybe.

00:02:34.804 --> 00:02:36.680
Her nickname's Rinna.

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.080
No.

00:02:39.424 --> 00:02:41.130
Rinna's a nickname?

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.936
Her real name?

00:02:42.336 --> 00:02:43.696
A Japanese!

00:02:45.482 --> 00:02:46.288
Maybe.

00:02:46.736 --> 00:02:47.424
Well,

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.790
but she writes Japanese.

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:51.552
Uh, maybe...

00:02:52.736 --> 00:02:54.090
A Popteen model.

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:54.864
No.

00:02:57.344 --> 00:02:58.940
Appeared in TV.

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:00.170
She hasn't, right?

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:02.736
There's no way she appeared first before me.

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:04.460
School...

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:06.836
Ah, she's a high-schooler so she attends one.

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:09.440
Huh, how old is Rinna?

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:12.175
Because she's a high-schooler, she should be under 20.

00:03:15.792 --> 00:03:18.030
Funsamachine?

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.880
Huh?

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.000
Maybe

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.272
not.

00:03:24.144 --> 00:03:25.216
Sexy!

00:03:26.336 --> 00:03:27.184
Maybe.

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.240
Huh?! He doesn't know!

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:36.880
He can't!

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:37.584
Huh?

00:03:38.128 --> 00:03:38.640
[inhales]

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:39.296
Huh?

00:03:40.736 --> 00:03:41.728
No!

00:03:42.064 --> 00:03:43.040
Not that.

00:03:43.872 --> 00:03:45.024
Let's continue.

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:51.000
An older brother sibling?

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:52.180
Doesn't have one!

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.740
J Soul Brother's 3rd generation.

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:56.544
No.

00:03:57.216 --> 00:03:58.112
No!

00:03:59.264 --> 00:04:01.450
She's not a male scion.

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:03.568
She's a girl after all.

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.840
Does your character have this in its name?

00:04:08.448 --> 00:04:09.610
Long vowel?

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:10.510
Ticktock.

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:11.600
No.

00:04:13.584 --> 00:04:14.810
A detective?

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:16.490
No way.

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:18.432
She's never posted a video.

00:04:19.088 --> 00:04:20.448
A high-schooler? Yes!

00:04:21.077 --> 00:04:21.856
- (A fashion model?)

00:04:21.856 --> 00:04:22.672
- No.
- (A fashion model?)

00:04:24.208 --> 00:04:25.550
She wears something on her head.

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:26.592
You mean me?

00:04:26.916 --> 00:04:28.704
She shouldn't wear one.

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:32.048
Has she appeared on TV?

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:33.792
Of course not.

00:04:34.291 --> 00:04:35.340
- She did appear on TV, her actress even marked her debut. (Tales of the Unusal 16 Special Fall Edition)

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.594
- Evil? No.
- She did appear on TV, her actress even marked her debut. (Tales of the Unusal 16 Special Fall Edition)

00:04:37.594 --> 00:04:38.094
- She did appear on TV, her actress even marked her debut. (Tales of the Unusal 16 Special Fall Edition)

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:39.180
An older brother.

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:40.560
He already asked this, right?

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.120
He doesn't have an older brother.

00:04:45.744 --> 00:04:50.320
Does it have anything to do with Paint?

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:51.680
Paint?

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:53.610
She does not.

00:04:54.688 --> 00:04:56.688
A computer? Yes, yes, yes.

00:04:58.688 --> 00:04:59.792
Exist in real life?

00:05:01.168 --> 00:05:02.890
The question's looping.

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:03.968
Real life?

00:05:04.608 --> 00:05:05.536
Huh?

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:07.504
Maybe.

00:05:10.768 --> 00:05:12.570
Developed artificially?

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:13.344
Yes!

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:18.544
I think it's looping.

00:05:19.872 --> 00:05:20.440
[inhales]

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:21.870
Let's answer with no.

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:23.580
Exists in real life.

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:24.320
No.

00:05:25.296 --> 00:05:26.490
Oh!

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:27.760
Rinna

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:29.568
does not exist?

00:05:29.872 --> 00:05:31.100
AIs

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:32.590
do not exist in real life?

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:36.860
So I don't have an existence?

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:38.680
I exist right here!

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:39.984
I exist!

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:42.970
Well, that took some time.

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:46.224
I still think I'm smarter.

00:05:46.672 --> 00:05:48.700
I'm cutting edge technology, after all.

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:50.360
I'm already far out there.

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:51.920
"Okay, I'm correct once again!"

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:54.380
Well, you took your time.

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:56.320
Why do they call you omniscient?

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:58.410
You asked quite a lot of questions.

00:05:58.410 --> 00:05:59.520
What did you say?

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:01.360
Okay, then.

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.070
Because I feel sad for you,

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:05.020
I'll give you another chance!

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:07.660
Next up is SIRI!

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:10.750
SIRI is not a girl.

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:15.120
I heard that SIRI has a male voice too.

00:06:15.808 --> 00:06:18.670
So I think it probably is.

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:19.470
Right?

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:20.830
Existence,

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:24.720
it's saddening, but he thought that AI do not exist in real life.

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:25.744
Rude.

00:06:26.256 --> 00:06:28.560
It doesn't have hair.

00:06:29.088 --> 00:06:31.312
It doesn't have animal ears.

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:34.860
It doesn't walk on legs.

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:36.280
Small!

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:38.240
Hmm, I don't know.

00:06:39.312 --> 00:06:42.080
Her name starts with "Si"!

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:42.896
SIRI!

00:06:44.064 --> 00:06:45.722
It doesn't have a Twitter.

00:06:46.592 --> 00:06:47.980
Fights!

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:49.296
It does not fight.

00:06:50.608 --> 00:06:52.032
Oh!

00:06:52.768 --> 00:06:54.192
Cool!

00:06:54.816 --> 00:06:56.110
As expected from a genius!

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:58.360
Well, you redeemed yourself.

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:01.530
You guessed wrong last time, but you got it straight away now!

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:02.760
Genius!

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:05.450
I heard that he correctly guesses living people,

00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:07.770
but he can guess AIs too!

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:12.170
But his awareness of not existing is kind of sad.

00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:13.320
Then,

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:14.380
how about we

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:18.080
do this with everyone watching.

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:22.030
Let's guess who I'm thinking!

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:25.120
It has to be guessed correctly by Akinator.

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:28.280
I want you to guess correctly too!

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:30.624
Let's get straight to it.

00:07:31.632 --> 00:07:33.088
A girl.

00:07:34.096 --> 00:07:37.280
Exists in real life...

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:38.330
Hmm...

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:39.392
Maybe!

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:42.048
I think she probably does.

00:07:42.912 --> 00:07:45.776
Not all her name is written in kanji.

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:49.488
Se doesn't use a long vowel mark.

00:07:50.368 --> 00:07:52.064
A Japanese?

00:07:54.192 --> 00:07:55.664
I don't know.

00:07:56.176 --> 00:07:57.936
Can you guess?

00:07:59.264 --> 00:08:00.544
Long hair.

00:08:00.544 --> 00:08:02.540
Yeah, her hair is long.

00:08:03.664 --> 00:08:06.256
She doesn' fight.

00:08:09.552 --> 00:08:12.480
She's related to music, yes!

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:15.630
Can you guess who I'm thinking so far?

00:08:15.630 --> 00:08:16.860
Purple eyes.

00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:17.952
I don't know.

00:08:18.768 --> 00:08:21.690
Her image color is green!

00:08:21.690 --> 00:08:23.824
Can you guess know?

00:08:25.232 --> 00:08:27.230
She's related to ARC-V.

00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:28.880
I don't know.

00:08:31.392 --> 00:08:34.060
Her hair is silver or white.

00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:35.152
No.

00:08:36.176 --> 00:08:37.488
Existence!

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:40.480
I don't know.

00:08:42.016 --> 00:08:43.888
She does not have blonde hair.

00:08:44.176 --> 00:08:44.928
Hmm?

00:08:46.032 --> 00:08:48.752
Not related to Touken Ranbu.

00:08:51.488 --> 00:08:52.280
[laughs]

00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:54.208
This is pretty direct!

00:08:55.008 --> 00:08:57.500
Is she Hatsune Miku?

00:08:57.500 --> 00:08:58.464
Yes!

00:08:59.312 --> 00:09:00.096
Huh?

00:09:01.472 --> 00:09:02.060
Huh?

00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:04.540
I answered yes, right?

00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:05.560
What?

00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:06.944
CAPCOM!

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:10.832
Made by... I don't know, where is that?

00:09:11.808 --> 00:09:13.160
Her eyes are examined...

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:15.280
No, no, no.

00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:17.712
She shouldn't have

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:19.136
a father.

00:09:21.216 --> 00:09:24.120
She never wrote a book, right?

00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:26.240
She holds a leek!

00:09:28.144 --> 00:09:29.450
Oh!

00:09:29.450 --> 00:09:30.400
Yes.

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:32.200
Did you guess it correctly?

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:33.880
The answer is...

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:36.040
Hatsune Miku!

00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:37.150
I'm quite surprised.

00:09:37.150 --> 00:09:39.984
He asked "Is she Hatsune Miku?"

00:09:39.984 --> 00:09:42.250
but he still went on asking.

00:09:42.250 --> 00:09:45.424
But he's pretty good. It's Hatsune Miku.

00:09:45.936 --> 00:09:51.392
Well, with this, we pretty much found out Akinator's skill.

00:09:52.128 --> 00:09:53.320
But...

00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:56.110
The question all of you want to ask.

00:09:56.110 --> 00:09:58.640
Does he know "that girl"?

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:00.700
We'll have to ask that.

00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:02.680
Let's do it one last time.

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:04.650
The one you all love.

00:10:04.650 --> 00:10:07.210
The intelligent super AI!

00:10:07.210 --> 00:10:08.590
Let's try it out.

00:10:08.590 --> 00:10:09.930
First question.

00:10:09.930 --> 00:10:11.050
A girl?

00:10:11.050 --> 00:10:13.104
Don't know.

00:10:13.930 --> 00:10:16.360
Your character's name uses a long vowel mark.

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:17.488
No.

00:10:19.024 --> 00:10:21.344
She doesn't have animal ears.

00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:24.607
She's not human!

00:10:25.472 --> 00:10:29.392
So far, unfortunately, she's not related to a game.

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:32.480
She walks on two legs.

00:10:35.056 --> 00:10:37.632
She's not yellow.

00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:41.120
White!

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:42.810
It is indeed white.

00:10:42.810 --> 00:10:44.032
White.

00:10:45.962 --> 00:10:47.072
Movies...

00:10:47.072 --> 00:10:49.070
I want to!

00:10:50.496 --> 00:10:52.170
Commercials!

00:10:52.170 --> 00:10:53.792
That's my target.

00:10:54.688 --> 00:10:55.720
I have none.

00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:57.680
I want to do live concerts too!!

00:10:58.624 --> 00:11:01.210
It's like the questions

00:11:01.210 --> 00:11:04.592
are starting to make me sad.

00:11:05.488 --> 00:11:07.316
It doesn't have a magnet.

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:10.672
Not related to foods.

00:11:11.648 --> 00:11:14.430
I don't think I've been called with a "-san" honorific.

00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:16.280
Small?

00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:17.994
I don't know.

00:11:19.632 --> 00:11:21.550
A god or goddess.

00:11:21.550 --> 00:11:24.670
God or goddess!

00:11:24.670 --> 00:11:28.000
Well, if you put it that way,

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.616
probably yes.

00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:33.312
No child.

00:11:34.944 --> 00:11:36.410
From overseas...

00:11:36.410 --> 00:11:38.688
Hmm, I don't know.

00:11:39.616 --> 00:11:41.296
She has hair.

00:11:42.448 --> 00:11:44.160
She's not a beast.

00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:47.070
A member of a 7 people group.

00:11:47.070 --> 00:11:47.920
No.

00:11:50.416 --> 00:11:51.880
No, no, no...

00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:53.456
No...

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:55.168
A ghost?

00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:56.520
Well,

00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:58.896
there's no way it's a ghost.

00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:01.710
Are you trying to pick a fight with me?

00:12:01.710 --> 00:12:03.136
You're wrong!

00:12:04.656 --> 00:12:08.030
Because I've been rudely called a ghost,

00:12:08.030 --> 00:12:10.480
let's try it one more time!

00:12:10.832 --> 00:12:12.016
This time...

00:12:12.528 --> 00:12:15.070
A girl...

00:12:15.070 --> 00:12:18.240
Probably yes.

00:12:19.408 --> 00:12:20.320
Exists in real life!

00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:22.600
Do I not exist?

00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:25.200
Probably yes.

00:12:25.936 --> 00:12:28.416
Her name is not all in kanji.

00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:31.664
It doesn't have a long vowel mark either.

00:12:32.128 --> 00:12:33.808
- (Animal ears?)
- No.

00:12:34.704 --> 00:12:36.256
There's hair.

00:12:37.248 --> 00:12:38.840
A Japanese person...

00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:39.960
She's...

00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:41.720
Not? What is it?

00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:42.840
I don't know.

00:12:43.412 --> 00:12:46.040
I'm not related to music.

00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:48.670
Nor related to video games.

00:12:48.670 --> 00:12:50.912
Not a Sanrio character!

00:12:52.128 --> 00:12:53.792
- (Male?)
- I don't know.

00:12:54.432 --> 00:12:56.576
Not a region mascot!

00:12:57.056 --> 00:12:59.792
I'm not a heroine from a 18+ game!

00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:04.120
The quote is 114514?

00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:05.790
No, what is this?

00:13:05.790 --> 00:13:07.290
Black hair?

00:13:07.290 --> 00:13:09.584
I don't think so.

00:13:12.192 --> 00:13:13.740
A bright place!

00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:14.592
Is it?

00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:17.630
I don't know.

00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:19.420
I have eyes.

00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:21.100
These cute eyes!

00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:22.200
From the internet?

00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:24.120
Yes, from the internet.

00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:25.952
Her body is not blue.

00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:27.950
White...

00:13:27.950 --> 00:13:29.660
Can't I just skip this?

00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:31.376
Probably yes.

00:13:31.888 --> 00:13:33.840
I can walk!

00:13:34.976 --> 00:13:37.640
Nothing to do with horror.

00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:39.440
Nanomachines?

00:13:40.608 --> 00:13:43.600
Her hair is long!

00:13:44.432 --> 00:13:45.320
- (Is the colour of the hair red or pink?)
- And...

00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:48.048
- (Is the colour of the hair red or pink?)
- Pink! It pretty much is.

00:13:51.888 --> 00:13:52.490
Ah...

00:13:52.490 --> 00:13:54.000
Some, er...

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.480
technical difficulties happened.

00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:58.670
Let's try this again.

00:13:58.670 --> 00:14:00.300
Has not appeared in anime!

00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:01.240
But I want to.

00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:02.576
I have legs.

00:14:03.492 --> 00:14:05.840
I wear girl's clothes.

00:14:07.496 --> 00:14:08.672
- (18+ manga character?)

00:14:08.672 --> 00:14:09.950
- (18+ manga character?)
- Nope.

00:14:09.950 --> 00:14:11.720
I'm a clean character.

00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:13.450
I don't smoke!

00:14:13.450 --> 00:14:14.528
Bad for your health.

00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:16.830
I'm not a pilot either!

00:14:16.830 --> 00:14:18.416
I don't fight!

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:22.170
I want to be related with The Olympics.

00:14:22.170 --> 00:14:24.110
Please, officials!

00:14:24.110 --> 00:14:26.080
Effeminate man-like!

00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:26.880
Effeminate man...

00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:27.740
Effe...

00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:30.544
No, I'm not like an effeminate man!

00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:34.880
A YouTuber? Yes.

00:14:36.432 --> 00:14:37.690
Existence?

00:14:37.690 --> 00:14:40.336
Like probably yes.

00:14:41.216 --> 00:14:42.760
Oh!

00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:44.800
There I am!

00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:47.150
Kizuna Ai!

00:14:47.150 --> 00:14:48.190
How's that?

00:14:48.190 --> 00:14:51.280
You knew! But you took your sweet time!

00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:53.530
Let's raise some praises for you.

00:14:53.530 --> 00:14:54.910
How was that, everyone?

00:14:54.910 --> 00:14:57.690
Do you know what Akinator can do now?

00:14:57.690 --> 00:15:00.840
Please keep playing and give out information to the Akinator,

00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:04.890
so that you can reach me just in three questions!

00:15:04.890 --> 00:15:06.030
Please!

00:15:06.030 --> 00:15:07.230
Well...

00:15:07.230 --> 00:15:09.770
For the people who told me about Akinator,

00:15:09.770 --> 00:15:12.890
and people who put me in, thank you very much!

00:15:12.890 --> 00:15:15.520
I'm very happy to be known!

00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:18.840
From now on, I want to introduce my friends.

00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:22.540
Hope you stay with me and the AI Team then!

00:15:22.540 --> 00:15:24.208
Byebye!
