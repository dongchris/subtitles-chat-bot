00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:02.560
I decided to get interviewed by VR Panorama [PANORA] Website: Part 4

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:06.980
So, I would like to move onto the final question. (Okay)

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:08.800
I think this is something that everybody has in their minds,

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:11.860
Okay, getting straight to the point: Is there a real person behind this?

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:13.060
(A real person?)

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:13.880
Yes a real person

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:15.760
Yes there is, its Kizuna Ai.

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:16.980
No no no no no

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.980
Not like that, uhh like a real person...

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:20.160
"Not like that a real person?"

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.560
Are you a bit mentally retarded?

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.440
(HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA)

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:29.580
When you say that to ME while being in this white reality of nothingness...

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.680
I'm starting to think there IS a serious problem with my mind

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.600
With the space around us being blank, your mind seems to be the same as well

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:36.260
HAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHA

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.520
You're kind of avoiding the question here but,

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.740
(No no no no no no) there IS a real person right?

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:42.740
Well 'this' is just a vessel, got it?

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:43.320
What?

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:49.660
I, Kizuna Ai is like this... soul within this shell, so yeah there is something

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.060
So, there's more?

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.880
Right, well... where do you think human souls go?

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:57.700
Hahahahahaha

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:58.200
(Mysterious Sermon on souls)

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.960
It goes up there, up there~

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:01.920
wow

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.920
I never expected to talk to Ai-chan about philosophical concepts

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.360
Yeah well, I am a genius A.I.

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:09.420
I'm amazed

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.100
Everybody, there isn't a real person behind all of this!

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.400
There isn't!

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.900
With that being said,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.720
since you have attended an interview with us, we would like to show you something

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:19.660
(Oooohhh)

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.580
Here it is, a head-mount display called the Oculus Rift

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:26.560
If you put this on,

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.840
you will be transported into a virtual reality!

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:30.400
Wow

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.380
Even though you are an A.I., a Virtual Reality is added,

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:35.520
it almost is contradictory

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:36.720
(Contradictory?)

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.200
Today, you are going to experience a software called "Mikulus" where you can meet Hatsune Miku

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.960
Oh, I get to meet that Hatsune Miku senpai?

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:44.460
(Yes you can)

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:44.960
Oooooohhhh

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.700
So if you can just put this on....

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:48.260
There we go

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:49.360
There we go

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:54.440
Its outer space!

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.660
Wow~

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.880
Eh, wow, she's breathing

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.500
Well you are breathing too Ai-chan

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:02.120
Well I am but,

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:05.220
Miku Senpai isn't an A.I.

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:06.320
(Well yeah she isn't)

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:07.340
She's breathing!

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:09.180
Wow!

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.120
(If you can get a bit closer..)

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:12.980
Ah!

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.240
She's wearing glasses!

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:15.540
Ah, she looked this way~!

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:16.580
(Yes your eyes do meet)

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.440
She's looking this way

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:20.020
(She's staring at you)

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:21.060
She IS staring at me

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.380
She's staring right through me

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.460
My name is Kizuna Ai, nice to meet you!

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.200
How does it feel to have her right in front of you?

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:31.700
Its amazing!

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.840
So this is what it feels like,

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:37.400
for humans to experience VR

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.900
Yes it is

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:43.120
Like it is for me to meet you today, you are experiencing what I am through this

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.640
I am amazed

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.520
So, how much does this cost?

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.500
Well the Oculus Rift costs around eighty thousand yen,

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:51.000
ooh

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.680
a PC costs around two hundred thousand yen

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:53.180
ooh

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.800
(And the grand total is..)

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:57.780
Well if you have around three hundred thousand yen, you can make it work

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:58.460
Also!

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.520
A special price from I-Channel !

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:01.740
HAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHA

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:03.260
So stuff like that exists here,

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:04.060
So, how much is it?

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:06.400
Wait I have to lower the price?

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.900
(Yeah)

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:07.420
Its common sense

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:09.740
What I have to leave this behind..

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:10.760
Aaaand?

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:11.920
Its not 'aaaand'

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:12.420
eh?

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.060
Is this a robbery?

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.260
Even that, this is amazing!

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.340
She's sitting on the earth

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.880
Maybe you can one day, (Yeah I want to do that) like this, come to the real world

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:25.460
I want to go~

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.100
In order to do that,

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:27.720
This.

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.760
This?

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:29.260
This

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:29.840
okay..

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:32.420
I am beginning to feel like I am being influenced negatively by this reality

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:33.400
Getting bad influence?

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:34.760
Thats the spirit!

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:35.420
Hahahahahaha

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:36.160
You're getting used to it

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.180
As you can see, we have come to the age where we can meet Miku-san

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:41.980
Its amazing that we are here

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.180
Like Miku-senpai is really there

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.760
Like I can reach her but at the same time I can't...

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.180
Okay, that "Mikulus" that we had you experience,

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:56.540
is actually using 'Tda Type Append Miku'

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.280
Ah, its the same as me!

00:03:59.280 --> 00:03:59.780
Yes it is

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.040
As we both know Tda is the one who modeled Ai-chan

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:05.020
(Yes thats ture)

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:06.040
(We're sisters!)

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:06.700
Indeed

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:07.500
In other words..

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:08.360
In other words,

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:10.980
I'm the younger sibling!

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.640
Who knows, we might see your character come out in a future release

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:15.220
Aahhhhh!

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:16.880
Oh yes please!

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.060
Top Brass, please make it work!

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.260
The amazing think about "Mikulus" is,

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.760
Yes

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:24.620
its just not seeing Miku-san but also

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:31.880
there is a concept where you can make her do things, such as jobs or tasks, practically anything in that reality

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:32.920
Oooh!

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:34.340
She can do tasks?

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:34.980
Yes she can,

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:38.880
In that reality, there is a desktop on the left side,

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:41.120
(Ah, the part where there was english written in green)

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:41.680
Yes, yes that

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:42.540
Ooohhh!

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:44.820
With the screen there,

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:46.500
and with Miku-san next to it,

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:51.880
it is possible to watch youtube videos or Ai-chans youtube videos on that big screen

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.860
(Oh wow!)

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:54.960
And if you look tight next to you, there is Miku-san,

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:56.440
and theres a small reaction from her

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:56.940
with just the eyes though

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:57.660
(Thats called cheating)

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:59.140
Hahahahahahahaha

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:00.580
Its pretty amazing,

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:01.120
but,

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:03.220
you can be there while we watch your videos

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:04.960
(Ahhh yep, that, thats good)

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:07.180
Cheating is not good!

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:09.500
I can perhaps introduce you to the creator or "Mikulus"

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:10.060
Ah!

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:10.560
Oh!

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:11.060
Oh!

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:12.640
"Ailus"

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:13.760
Ailus? (Ailus)

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:15.020
Ailus (Ailus)

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:17.660
The day you two can meet might come

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:19.140
(I want that day to come!)

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:21.080
All you have to do is put on the head mount display,

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:23.040
you don't have to get punched so thats a good merit

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:24.940
That is a good merit everybody

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:26.500
Well I guess its something like this..

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.200
When the interview is over how am I supposed to get back?

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:30.120
Like how do I leave this reality?

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.260
Well, you have to fall asleep once again

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:32.760
Eh?!

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:34.400
Do I have to do that again?

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:35.840
"when you wake up you're in the middle of the ocean"

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:37.760
Really the ocean?

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:39.580
I want it to be on land

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:41.340
Okay, then if you can praise me in 3 ways

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:42.060
Say 3 good things about you?

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:42.600
Yes

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.620
Uhh first, your eyes are cute

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:47.940
Eyes? (Eyes)

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:49.900
The eyes of the VR Geezer is dead

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:52.840
Yeah, they're dead, they don't even blink

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:56.280
Well your eyes are cute

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:57.240
(My eyes are cute)

00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:59.100
Next, your hair style?

00:05:59.320 --> 00:05:59.820
(Hairstyle?)

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:01.160
(Hm, okay)

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:05.220
What else....

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:08.220
(Why are you thinking?!)

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:08.980
Woah, scary!

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:11.360
Oh crap, I can't leave here!

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:13.280
Yes you cant, well you can into the ocean

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:14.140
Ocean?

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:14.640
Yep

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:15.520
Please, not the ocean

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:17.100
Please not the ocean

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:19.360
I don't like being cold

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:22.460
Then, if you beat me in a game of rock paper scissors

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:23.480
I'll let you return to your reality

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:26.640
ROCK, PAPER, SCISORS!

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:27.780
Ah,

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:28.880
Into the ocean it is

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:29.680
not the ocean...

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:33.980
I'M JUST KIDDING!!

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:36.840
I'll return you properly,

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:38.160
I don't want to be arrested

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:41.120
Well you know, when you recover into youtube and you get a Ban,

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:42.680
you don't want that to happen right?

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:45.360
I cant seem to take your joke in...

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:47.180
I'm joking~

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:50.840
Can I really leave this reality?

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:52.240
Its ok, its ok
