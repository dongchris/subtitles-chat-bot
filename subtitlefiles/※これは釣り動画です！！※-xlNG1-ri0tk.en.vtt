So, for today

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:16.920
I caught some mackerel by jigging just before filming this, so
[ TL note: Jigging is a technique in fishing using a specific lure ]

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.800
I'd like to use them as live bait to catch some blueback fish!

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.520
It's pretty calm

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.240
And there's no birds flying so...

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.060
The expectancy for getting fish is quite low...

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.400
But I've already gone and taken time to prepare

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.660
So I'm going to catch a blueback fish no matter what !

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.260
Hmmm...

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.380
Maybe a little further out?

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:40.620
Hoi!

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:56.460
Oh oh!

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.020
Here it comes, here it comes!

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.460
I've got a bite!

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:01.940
Wait, wait... You ready?

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.200
And... Uryaa!

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:06.160
I've hooked it!

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:07.940
My line's really dragging... Wow!

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:09.620
For real, it's big, it's big!

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:10.700
What is this!!

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.700
Waah!

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:12.840
My line's all going out

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:13.860
Oh no, oh no, oh no...

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.280
Aaaaah

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.220
Hoisho~!

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:24.340
Alright!

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.320
I caught you ♡

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.320

What should I do for today's video...

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.880
Hm?

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.260
"Please catch me?"
