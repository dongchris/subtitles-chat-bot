00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.200
Well that is what she said.

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:17.600
I can't believe we were in the same class this whole semester and we just met today.

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:19.060
Yeah. It's too bad.

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.260
Too bad.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.520
Well, just because class is over, doesn't we still can't see each other, right?

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:28.740
Yeah. I can come by the bowling alley where you work.

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.100
Cool, totally hook it up.

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:31.320
Awesome, my boyfriend loves bowling.

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.880
I'm sorry, what'd you say?

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:35.580
My boyfriend loves bowling.

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:37.120
I'm sorry, what'd you say?

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:39.000
My boyfriend loves to bowl?

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.300
I'm sorry, what'd you say?

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:41.720
My boyfriend-

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:43.720
Nooooooooooooo

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:52.660
So, it's a little over-dramatic, but that's pretty much how I feel inside every single time.

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.340
Well, it was really nice meeting you.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.400
Yeah, it was nice meeting you, too.

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:57.760
My ride's here.

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:04.680
And when I say every single time, it's because every girl I crush on has a boyfriend.

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:06.780
Oh, come on!

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.660
Every

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:13.380
All right.

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:16.380
Single

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.380
Hey Viviane, it's Frank.

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.380
Yeah, you gave me your number at the car wash today.

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:21.640
Oh yeah, hey...

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.280
You know, let me call you right back because my boyfriend-

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:25.320
*dial tone*

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.120
Hello?

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.360
What the hell?

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:32.600
Time

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:35.940
That's just my luck.

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.240
The universe just wants to dangle all this carrots in front of me.

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.020
It's cruel.

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.280
Take this girl, for example.

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.280
Her name is Carole.

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.440
She's come in here a few times over the last couple months.

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:50.700
Super nice,

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.580
super cute,

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:54.340
but I just know,

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:55.920
I just know

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.920
she probably has a boyfriend,

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.920
knowing my luck.

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.920
Although,

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.920
of all the time she's been here,

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.400
she hasn't shown any signs.

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.760
Hmm... full-frontal hug with hip contact.

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:12.760
Is that a boyfriend?

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:13.800
Nah.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.800
Friends can hug like that.

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.320
Friends can sit on each others laps, right?

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.320
Yeah, totally.

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.240
I mean why this always happen?

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.160
It's not that complicated, Frank.

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.700
If you're interested in them, chances are, other guys are interested too.

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:31.420
You are not the only one with eyes in the-

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.420
Dude, but they're never single, okay.

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:34.980
They always have a boyfriend.

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.980
If they're never single, how do I even get a shot?

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.280
Right, like how did her current boyfriend get into that spot, if she's always been in a relationship?

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.100
Dude, if I could figure it that out-

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:47.920
Then you'd have infinite potential to get with any girl on the face of the universe.

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.040
Tanner,

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.520
what are you doing here?

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:54.720
Oh, the arcade is getting a little lonely,

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.720
and I overheard your little pity party.

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.720
I now know we're on a common mission.

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:01.160
Walk and talk!

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.160
I've been in your shoes, Frankie.

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.660
For the last fifteen years of my life

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:08.220
I've wondered the same thing.

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:11.920
Why every girl I liked has always had a boyfriend.

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.540
Now Jeff is right.

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:14.700
Good catches

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.340
are always gonna have multiple people going after them,

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:18.580
which means

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:20.580
they'll usually always be in a relationship.

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.960
Unless of course they're in that

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:25.500
"oh I just wanna be single right now" phases.

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:27.700
But sometimes

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:30.300
a beautiful thing happens.

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.300
They break up.

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:34.900
You are a terrible person.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:36.660
Can you hold this for me?

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:39.360
What I mean is,

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:41.380
in the tragic case

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:43.380
she breaks up with her boyfriend,

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.920
you now have a chance to be there for her and take over.

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:51.880
And this is your window of opportunity to swoop in.

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:55.840
Now depending on how awesome this girl is, that window is gonna go real fast,

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.840
so you gotta get in there real quick!

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.720
So, when will I know when this window of opportunity opens up?

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:03.840
You need to stick around her.

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:04.800
Always be her friend,

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:05.820
and always keep up with her.

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:08.520
So you want me to voluntarily put myself in the friend zone?

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:13.820
What?

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:15.620
No, no.

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:17.620
I'm friends with like fifteen different girls, you know,

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:19.120
just to keep my place in line.

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:20.820
It's, it's not so bad.

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:24.660
Right, but you also haven't had a girlfriend in, like, ever.

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:26.160
Aha!

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.080
Here, take one of these.

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:29.760
What's this for?

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:34.900
That girl you like in there. You hold on to this, and then when you find out that she's been broken up with,

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.460
you come in and swoop in with this rose.

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:38.560
Swoop!

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:40.460
That is the worst advice ever!

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:42.640
Want a rose?

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:46.260
Get that disgusting thing off my coffee table!

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:48.900
You and Linda have been going out for a while. How did you do it?

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:50.300
Look, I feel for you, man.

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.820
When I first met Linda, she had a boyfriend, too.

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:54.340
He was hot.

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:59.760
And, I knew for a fact that there were at least three other guys going after her.

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.300
So many guys wanted to be with me.

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:04.360
So how did you do it?

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:06.060
I had an inside man.

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:07.380
Oh, God!

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:15.540
Look, it imperative that you have someone close to her that can directly or indirectly find information about their relationship.

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:18.480
Ooh, that's so evil!

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:20.160
But so necessary.

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.860
Look, man, you gotta know what you're working with.

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:25.840
What if this girl is happy in her relationship?

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:28.980
You don't want to be that dick that's trying to break up a happy couple.

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:34.580
And plus, when a girl is happy with her dude, any other guy that approaches her just comes off creepy.

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:36.020
Carole!

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:39.160
Definitely leave your boyfriend for me.

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:40.380
Yeah.

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:49.700
Yeah, definitely don't wanna be that guy.

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:52.440
But what if she's not happy?

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:57.380
What if her boyfriend is just a stupid douche-stinky boyfriend, right?

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:02.080
But you're never gonna know if she's happy or not unless you have someone on the inside.

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:04.600
And that way, I can avoid being friendzoned.

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:05.940
Exactly.

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:07.740
Wait, what if...

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.500
Hey! You're Carole's friend, Amy, right?

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:12.600
Yeah.

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:14.940
Okay so this is sort of awkward, but-

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:16.400
That guy at the bowling alley totally likes you.

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:17.140
What guy?

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:20.680
Don't just come right out and say it. Just be normal friends.

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:22.100
Right.

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:24.140
Thanks for having me over.

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:25.700
Yeah, I had fun.

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:27.460
Yeah, cool, so I gotta-

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:29.600
Whoa! What are you doing?

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.660
I thought you liked me.

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:35.180
What? No! We're just friends!

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:36.320
Carole!

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:37.600
I like Carole?

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:41.260
Can you both stop it?

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:43.860
Is this girl that special to you?

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:44.980
Yeah, I think so.

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:46.440
Think so!?

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:51.620
Is she worth waiting for in the unknown chance she becomes single, and

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:53.480
you have no idea when it can happen?

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:55.300
Maybe.

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:59.820
Is she worth causing a bunch of drama and hurting people if you say something?

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:01.040
Uhh...

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:04.380
If you're ready to either swallow your feelings or piss off a bunch of people,

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:06.660
then all this advice is actually valid.

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:09.300
You do want to stay friends, but not in a shady way.

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:15.240
And yes, it is good to have someone that knows the situation better on the inside,

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:17.480
but don't manipulate people.

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:20.520
Yeah, don't do that, Frank, come on.

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:23.360
It's not one simple strategy.

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:26.300
It's a bunch of variables that have to align.

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:29.240
So stop thinking you are the perfect match for every girl,

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:32.600
and that it's only because she has a boyfriend why you can't be together.

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:37.200
There is a reason why the window of opportunity is closing on you,

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:40.680
you just can't see it right now.

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:43.720
You're so hot!

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:47.260
Take a walk.

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:48.960
Outta here Frank.

00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:56.120
Thank you!

00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:00.100
Carole?

00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:01.240
Hi!

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:02.420
Oh, hi!

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:04.140
Frank. I work at the bowling alley.

00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:06.980
Frank. Thanks for the discount last time.

00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:10.160
Oh, no problem. I haven't seen you guys there lately.

00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:15.060
Oh. My boyfriend's gotten really into tennis lately, so we've been doing a lot of that, now.

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:17.260
Your boyfriend's really lucky.

00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:20.980
Thanks. Maybe I'll see you at the bowling alley soon.

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:22.000
Yeah.

00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:24.760
Better see some turkeys!

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:27.380
So lame.

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:34.920
What does rhyme with hug me?

00:08:37.060 --> 00:08:37.880
Hey.

00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:39.760
Hey. Was that Carole that just came out?

00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:41.480
Yeah. I said hi to her inside.

00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:43.700
Nice. What else you say?

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:46.580
Just that her boyfriend is really lucky.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:49.640
What!

00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:54.560
Seriously, after five minutes of all that advice, that's what you say?

00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:55.780
You compliment her boyfriend?

00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:56.920
Well, I was complimenting her, too.

00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:00.480
It doesn't matter. Look, you're doing the exact opposite of what you need to be doing.

00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:02.580
I'm not really trying to do anything.

00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:04.180
Okay, now I'm confused.

00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:06.980
Look. I think I just need to relax a bit.

00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:10.520
I don't want to be one of those guys who's always angry about girls.

00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:13.460
All right, well, what happens when the next girl you like also has a boyfriend?

00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:16.880
I don't know. It'll depend on the situation then.

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:20.260
But for now, Carole seems happy.

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:24.300
And when the timing is right, I'll find that with someone, too.

00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:29.660
All right, fair enough. At least you'll stop whining.

00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:34.880
Friends can share drinks.

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:56.680
Excuse me. Do you know if it's okay to park here?

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.260
Um...

00:09:58.540 --> 00:09:59.960
Oh, my gosh!

00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:01.240
Carole!

00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:02.100
Yeah!

00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:03.000
What are you doing here?

00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:05.240
Just shopping, running some errands.

00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:06.960
Are you still at the bowling alley?

00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:09.340
No. I left my bowling days behind.

00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:11.080
Yeah, me too.

00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:13.580
Oh, your boyfriend never got back into it?

00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:16.380
Well, we're not together any more.

00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:18.040
Oh, sorry.

00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:19.840
Totally okay.

00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:23.220
So, what are you doing now?

00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:29.100
Applying to grad school. And me and my girlfriend are gonna go to a bookstore, get some studying done.

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:31.440
Oh, that's great.

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:33.440
Well, I don't want to make you late.

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:35.440
And yeah, I think you're good 'til three.

00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:36.940
Thanks.

00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:45.400
You know, sometimes, it just seems like you're missing out on all these different people.

00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:49.420
But in reality, you're just being saved for the right person

00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:51.520
who's even better.

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:54.480
They didn't have the tira misu, so I got the red velvet.

00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:55.460
Oh, thanks.

00:10:57.320 --> 00:10:58.280
Ready to go?

00:10:58.380 --> 00:10:59.280
Yeah.

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:06.960
Man, I knew she had a boyfriend!

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.720
Why does this happen every single time?

00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:39.300
Why does this always happen?

00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:43.860
Sorry. Can you try? Sorry, don't jump. Like just try making more

00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:47.420
Right. Like how did her current boyfriend get into that spot. What?

00:11:47.660 --> 00:11:48.440
God!

00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:50.620
Unless you uh

00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:53.780
You're not Carole!

00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:56.160
Are you?

00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:02.880
Oh my gosh!

00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:04.000
Carole!

00:12:04.340 --> 00:12:05.520
That loser from the bowling alley!

00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:08.280
What are you doing? What are you up to?

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:10.220
What does it look like I'm doing?

00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:14.440
You can't read, and you don't have any deductive reasoning skills?

00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:15.640
It's my first time here.

00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:16.820
You've gotten really mean

00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:19.360
over the last two years. I didn't remember you like. You were really sweet.

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:20.740
You never knew me.

00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:21.940
That's true. Touche.

00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:23.800
What!

00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:24.700
What!

00:12:25.060 --> 00:12:25.580
What!

00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:27.420
Friends can share drinks, too.

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:28.500
I'll do it again.

00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:31.720
Friends can share drinks, too.

00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:36.120
My God!

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:40.140
Who are you talking to?

00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:43.100
Huh? No, nothing. Let's go. Let's get outta here.
