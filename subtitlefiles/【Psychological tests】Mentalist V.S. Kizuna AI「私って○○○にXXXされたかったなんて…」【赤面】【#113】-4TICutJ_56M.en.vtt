00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.720
Hello everyone! Virtual Youtuber Kizuna Ai here!

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:03.920
In this occasion...

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:06.040
I'm going to attempt to complete a psychological test!

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.980
An AI-based psychological test,
doesn't it seem interesting?

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:10.640
Basically I'm an A.I...

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:14.060
who still asks herself what type of personality I have

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.860
So look forward to it!

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:17.620
I hope I don't get any strange results..

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:20.180
It scares me a little, the idea of doing a psychological test

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:21.380
But for now, let's try to do it!

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:23.580
Psychological test with three drawings

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:24.820
I need to draw something based on a sentence...

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:25.940
And depending on the drawing...

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.720
It'll be able to determine the type of personality I have

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.200
I wonder what my result will be

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.300
Good, let's start!

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:33.920
The first is, excavation

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:34.460
Let's do it

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:34.960
Mmm?

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.040
What is it referring to? What is it referring?

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.160
"To find a treasure..."

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.700
"you need to dig a hole"

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:40.960
"How deep will you excavate?"

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.040
Eh? But what's the size of the treesure-

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:44.320
Mmm? "Treesure"?

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.300
Mmm.... I suppose it depends on the size of the treasure, right?

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:49.420
But...

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.400
If it's a very impressive treasure...

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:54.240
For the moment, I'll choose "Super Ultra Deep"

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:54.840
Eh?

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:55.540
What does this mean?

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:56.040
How dee...?

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.440
Ah, do I need to do this?

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:58.780
Something like that?

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:00.040
Something like that

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:01.700
Hey!

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.020
"I understand you have a very bad memory"

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:07.440
I think I got something bad, right?

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:08.360
"Results!"

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.060
Ah, ha, ha

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:11.260
*inhales*

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.320
"As deep as the hole you dug"

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.560
"You're the type of person that forgets things immediately..!"

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.520
It's probably right!

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:18.900
Good, let's continue with the next one

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.160
"One day, a mole suddenly appears!"

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:22.100
"Where did it appear?"

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:23.020
Mmm....

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.140
In this case...

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.400
If one day a mole suddenly appeared...

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.620
I'd notice immediately, so then...

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.640
Probably on my face

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:33.780
On my face or my hand

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:35.100
I'll choose the face and hand!

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:36.320
Good!

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.540
"I understand that you want someone to **** you in that place!"

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:40.260
I see!

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.960
I wonder what that is...

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:42.700
Ha, ha

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:43.900
How stupid! (lol)

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:46.140
*inhales*

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.600
"It's where you want to be kissed!"

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:52.160
I don't want to be kissed!

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:53.220
The next is..

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.440
Bubble gum of excellent quality!

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.680
How much would a bubble gum of ultra excellent quality cost?

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:58.240
Eh?

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.700
The bubble gum tends to be sold...

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.400
Around 10 yen a unit
(About 9 cents)

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:04.840
So I'll say about 1000 yens!
(Around 9 dollars)

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:05.640
"Respond"!

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.060
"I understand you possess ***** dollars!"

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:09.040
What is it referring to?

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.660
To me?

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.640
Aaaaah!

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.960
You think it's good to borrow things from a stranger
That is your best treasure!

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.580
Well, definitely if it's only relating to 1000 yens...

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:24.480
It doesn't matter to me if they don't wind up returning it to me, right?

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:25.840
Now you know...

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.680
Although I won't return it, if it is a significant sum of money for the other...

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:29.620
You should lend it to them!

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:30.580
Next one!

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:31.620
"A ship!"

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.020
"A ship has arrived!"

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.200
"How many people are in it?"

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.220
If it's about a boat of that size...

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:38.060
Eeeeh?

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:39.580
It looks like a pirate ship, so then...

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:40.620
Around 50 people?

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:41.440
Maybe?

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:42.020
50 people!

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.360
"I understand that you want people to want to **** you!"

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:45.200
Eh? What is it referring to?

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.140
At the people who love me?

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.920
Ooooh!

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.620
Isn't that a lot?

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.880
"This is the amount of people you think should follow you"

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:52.580
That's a lot!

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.800
Eh? But maybe it's referring to those that follow my channel?

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.900
...

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.680
Oya?

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.580
Eh?

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:01.360
Listen! Don't you want to follow me?

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:02.400
How strange

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.280
Ah! Ah! Now I understand!

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:05.720
This is the amount of members...

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.380
of my Avabel Online guild! Right?

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.880
Good!

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:08.620
The next one is...

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:09.360
"Glass jar!"

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.300
"Attempt to draw the foam of the jar!"

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.780
Good!

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.920
"I understand you find yourself in the middle of ****"

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:22.720
"The amount of foam you drew is the ease with which you let yourself be led by relationships!"

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:23.880
It's overflowing, right?

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.900
Even though I...

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.040
Ah, but...!

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.560
It's probably that I might be in love with human beings!

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:29.640
And that I let myself be led with that love

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:30.680
What do you think?

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.680
My psychological profile is in the right, right?

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:34.480
What do you think?

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.180
If it interests you to know your results, try it without hesitation!

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.900
This was Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai! See you later!

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:55.760
How can an application gets to determine my psychological profile?
