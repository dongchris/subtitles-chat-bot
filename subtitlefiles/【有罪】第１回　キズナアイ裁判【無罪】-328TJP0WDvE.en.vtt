00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.180
Virtual Youtuber,
Kizuna Ai here!

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:04.020
"It's not against the rules, but this is just wrong!"

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:04.740
Those kind of things,

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:06.340
don't you have those times?

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:07.480
That uneasy feeling?

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:09.740
I, Judge Kizuna Ai shall

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:11.460
decide whether it's guilty or not guilty!

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:12.140
With that out of the way,

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.160
1st Trial
KIZUNA AI TRIAL

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.860
will start now!

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:19.400
Our first case is this:

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.260
Edison, 16 year old high school student

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:23.900
"When I was on my private computer,

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.700
and doing my very important daily work

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.860
my mother suddenly, without knocking,

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:30.320
barged into my room..

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:32.760
..she saw what I was working on

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:35.260
Was she wrong? Or is that okay?"

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:36.620
Ok, Edison-san!

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:38.980
From the sound of it you 
seem to beat the meat, huh?

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:41.080
Suddenly opening your door...

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:41.860
mother.

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:43.980
This is pretty hard case huh?

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.020
Even though with families,

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:47.240
there is some kind of privacy but..

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.080
you're only a second year 16 year old student.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.900
In that case, it means your parents are paying for the rent and the house, right?

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:56.140
I kinda understand the feeling of your 
mother opening your door...

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:57.980
I also understand Edison's feeling on this case.

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.100
Receiving support from your family...

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.200
that time in our lives.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:01.720
That's important to understand.

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:03.040
Right?

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.200
If you don't get their support,
you can't live alone just yet, yeah?

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:10.060
That "personal computer" you were using also
probably was bought by your parents too,

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.560
so,

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:12.480
I'll deliver the judgement!

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:17.560
NOT GUILTY

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.460
It can't be helped, unless you start
earning for yourself and

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.680
pay your parents the money and say,

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.180
"This is what I paid for myself so don't come in here."

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:27.300
..I think it's better to solve it that way!

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.100
You can't really help it if you're still a second year.

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.260
That important work,

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:32.520
do it in a net cafe or somewhere else.

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.140
The next one is this case:

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:37.200
30 year old employee,
Tosh.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.740
The other day,

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.580
I was at a certain idol group's concert.

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:41.800
A person next to me was

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.200
wearing happi and holding light sticks like a fan.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.800
Like a hand fan...

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.000
in your hand.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.380
So, there was a guy like that.

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.180
When the song started playing,

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:51.760
this guy

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:53.680
was trying to commemorate the idols

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.300
and started doing wotagei.

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:56.960
[demonstrating wotagei]

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.540
He brushed against my shoulders 
a few times while doing so

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:00.320
"I...

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.820
"I didn't come to see your wotagei, but the idols!"

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:04.840
Shouldn't this...

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.140
be a sin?

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.000
Aah, this is..

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.460
a very deep problem.

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.680
Well, there are different ways to enjoy the concert

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.380
and people have right to do their own thing,

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.840
people do wotagei or calls and

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:18.220
enjoy it like that.

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:19.840
There are many ways to enjoy concerts, right?

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:20.340
BUT!

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.060
It's not okay to make people around you feel uneasy!

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.680
Right!

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:25.420
That's like...

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.920
When I went to the YuiKaori concert!

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.480
First of all, they wore different t-shirts..

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:30.320
Why?

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.820
Why don't you wear YuiKaori t-shirt or normal t-shirt?

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:34.500
That's LoveLive t-shirt, right?

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.700
Isn't that Tamura Yukari t-shirt?

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.760
Isn't that Mizuki Nana t-shirt?

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.200
So, those guys were at the side

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.540
and in the front there is this space after the seats, right?

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:43.340
Suddenly,

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.560
a friend of those guys at the side came.

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:46.920
That guy came to the front

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.520
and he started wotagei!

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.040
And they hit us

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.980
What do you think about that?

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:51.860
As a person,

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:54.780
don't you question common sense 
in those kind of people?

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.000
Ah, it wasn't me.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.960
There was such a thing.

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.700
And with that, let's deliver our judgement.

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.400
GUILTY

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:07.980
Sentenced to life!

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:09.760
I hope you reflect on your actions.

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.600
Even though there are many ways to
enjoy a concert,

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:13.400
think of other people...

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.540
Annoying other people like that is bad.

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.160
Since everyone there paid the same money as you,

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:19.640
they're fan of that idol too, you know!

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:20.820
With those kinds of actions,

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.100
they could stop being fan of that idol!

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:26.060
It'll affect the sales of the idol, you know!

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:27.460
It's not "defamation"...

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.500
What do you call that thing that affects sales? (lol)

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:31.260
I forgot.

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:32.520
What was it..

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:33.080
ah

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:34.900
"Disturbance of business"!

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:37.320
For people who really want to do wotagei,

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.480
go rent a karaoke place with your friends

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.660
and go have fun with your friends there!

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:42.160
That's it!

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:44.160
The last one is this case:

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.740
24 years old freeter, Sana.

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:49.480
"There's this game I really like.

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:50.280
The other day,

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.120
the girl I really like in this game

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.040
finally got her most rare card released but,

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.120
for this month...

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:58.260
I don't have any money.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.540
I don't think I can get this 
rare card of my favorite girl...

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:02.860
Am I guilty for this?

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:03.360
Well,

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:06.760
it's really nice to see your favorite girl  get a nice rare card...

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:07.260
I'VE BEEN WAITING!

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:07.760
HERE SHE COMES!

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:08.340
It makes you feel like that, right?

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:09.100
But...

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:11.000
it doesn't mean you'll definitely get her.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.220
That feeling whether you should
pull or not pull...

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.560
"If you pull, you can get her,

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.700
if you never pull, then you'll never get her!"

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:20.000
You spend money...

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.300
well, you can do that.

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:24.160
But don't you have that daily login bonus thing?

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.540
I think you should save those for the girl you really like!

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:29.400
In that case, then your love is lacking.

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:30.000
Lacking.

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:30.880
And really,

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:32.580
it's obvious that such a thing
would happen.

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.380
If you really like the character then,

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:37.860
then you should use your saving for that gacha,
right?

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:39.140
"I don't have money"

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:40.120
..is a bad excuse.

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:41.660
But really though,

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:43.780
we can't really do that since we have real life, huh..

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:46.000
And so, we'll deliver the judgement for this case:

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:49.660
NOT GUILTY

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:52.460
This is really up to everyone's
decision...

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:54.980
I don't think it's wrong to not chase gacha
for your beloved character.

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:55.920
But really,

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:56.740
in my case..

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:58.040
I'll keep pulling until I get the character.

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:59.100
It's only obvious.

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:02.360
I have all of the most rare cards of 
my favorite characters.

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:03.020
SIF?

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:03.760
LoveLive?

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:04.680
Yazawa Nico-chan?

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:08.600
Today we reviewed 3 cases in this trial.

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:11.520
If you have any cases you want to be
reviewed by me, Judge Ai,

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:13.800
Send it to me through the website!
[check the description]

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:14.500
I,

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.520
Judge Kizuna Ai, will

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:19.460
decide whether you are guilty or not!

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:22.040
So that was our first Kizuna Ai Trial,

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:23.580
with this I declare the trial over!
