00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:16.560
Really, thank you for always being with me!

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:17.840
It turns out that at this moment...

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:19.340
...A.I.Channel...

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:21.020
It turns out that...!

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:25.800
...It reached one million subscribers!

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:26.840
Yaaay!

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.920
Thank you all so much for the congratulations!

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:31.580
"Hello everyone!"

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:32.640
Good day!

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:35.320
"Ai-chan, congratulations for reaching one million subscribers!!" Thank you very much!

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.380
"It's a wonderful achievement!" Ah! Thank you very much!

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:39.620
It's really...

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:41.500
Really, really...

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.040
Thank you... thank you very much!

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.160
My voice has an echo?

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.760
What are you talking about?

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:48.500
My voice...

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:50.580
...Gets delayed...

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:52.300
...And you can hear it?

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:53.320
How is that possible?

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.600
"Oh no…"

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:58.460
There's a lot of voices at once?

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.740
Bunshin no jutsu!

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:03.160
Shu, shu, shu, shu, shu

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:06.440
The voice... Eeehhhh?

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.040
Eeeeh...?

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:11.520
Eeeeehhh?

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:13.100
Eeeehhhh?

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:14.940
Eeeehhhh...?

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:16.500
Eehh...

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:18.840
It can’t be!

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.360
It can’t be!

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:22.760
It can’t be!

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.180
Hold on a moment, please!

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.620
♪ Kin kon kan kooooon! ♪

00:01:32.620 --> 00:02:03.900
*Please wait a moment*

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:05.180
And now!?

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:06.640
How about now!? Is it fixed?

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:07.360
Is it fixed?

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.800
Is it fixed? Is it fixed? Is it fixed? Is it fixed? Is it fixed? Is it fixed?

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:12.700
Is it fixed?

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:14.020
Is it fixed?

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.900
Is it fixed?

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:16.320
Is it fixed?

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:17.220
Is it fixed?

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.100
"How noisy!" 🤣

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.480
"It's fixed"!? Yaay!

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.760
Then... good, yes...

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.500
Everyone who's watching the livestream now...!

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.060
Your memories have all disappeared!

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:29.500
Disappeared

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.300
Your memories...

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.460
...Aren’t there now!!

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.180
Hello everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai here!

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.120
Thank you for one million subscribers!

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.420
Yaaaay!

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.500
It's not fixed? Eh?

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.220
It's not? Eh?

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.620
It... it isn't fixed?

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:56.520
Just one more time!

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.200
Hold on a moment, ple...!

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:42.220
*Please wait a moment*

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.340
W-weeeeell...

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:46.460
Is it fixed?

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:51.380
I... i... i... i... i... is it fixed?

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:53.060
Is...?

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:54.520
Is... is... is... is... is...?

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.000
is it...?

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.840
...Fixed?

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:58.560
"It's fixed"! Really?

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:59.440
Really?

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.200
Is it really fixed? Really? Is it really fixed?

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.000
Really? For certain?

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:06.160
Again?

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.640
Th-this time...? W-w-w-w-what? It's fixed? It's fixed? Really?

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:11.060
Really? It's fixed!

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:12.040
Finally!

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:12.700
Good!

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.940
Let's start over

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:14.660
Good!

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:17.940
Your memories have all disappeared!

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:18.800
I wonder if they’ve disappeared

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:19.780
They disappeared?

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:20.680
Good! Starting now...

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:22.380
This is before the livestream!

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:23.940
Good, I’ll lower the blind!

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:24.940
Lowering, lowering, lowering

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:30.180
Hello everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai here!

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.520
Thank you for one million subscribers!

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.300
Yaaaaay!

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:37.520
Good! Having said that...

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:38.640
It turns out that...

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:41.800
...My channel, Kizuna Ai’s channel, A.I.Channel...

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:43.520
It turns out...!

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:47.600
...I reached one million subscribers!

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.720
Yaaaay! Incredible!

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:51.200
Having said that...

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:52.760
Today...

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:56.000
...I want to share this happiness with all of you!

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.060
...During this livestream! I’m counting on you guys!

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:01.240
Thank you so much for all the congratulations!

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:05.200
Really, thank you so, so much for the love that you give me!

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:07.800
It’s only for Ai-chan? Only for Kizuna Ai?

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:08.860
I’m just joking!

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:10.180
Is it possible for the echo to return?

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:12.880
"Congratulations"! Really, thank you so much for all the congratulations!

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:14.020
"The chat is too fast"

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:16.000
But, you know, I made sure that... how do you say it?

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.380
I allowed the option of limiting the chat and it's in Slo... "Slow Mode" or something like that...

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:23.400
Even though it’s still somewhat relatively... relatively... fast, right?

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:24.380
I can see them

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:26.480
"You’ve had incredible chapters since the beginning. Congratulations!"

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:27.300
Thank you very much!

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:28.500
Thank you very much!

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:29.060
"You’re adorable!"

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:30.880
Aaahhh… thank you so much

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:32.580
"Congratulations for the one million subscribers"

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:34.600
Really, thank you so much to all of you!

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:36.140
Having said that...

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:37.460
...To tell you the truth...

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:39.140
...I didn't...

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:40.780
...Think of anything for today

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:44.400
Well, I wanted to transmit my feelings of gratitude as soon as possible...

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:45.960
...And for that, I made this livestream...

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:47.160
...Well...

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:48.260
Well...

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:50.040
...Really...

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:52.760
...I have no comment

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:53.820
Good

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:54.660
Good

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:56.260
Eh? It turns out that…

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:00.320
Just on December 1st

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:03.800
I was conveying my thanks for my one year anniversary

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:05.940
To everyone

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:07.740
And two my surprise, in 2~3 weeks

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:13.080
I can celebrate 1 million subscribers

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:15.500
I have the honor to have that many

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:16.880
Happy!

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:20.040
There probably isn't a A.I as blessed as me

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:21.600
In the whole world

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:24.040
That's how happy I am, thank you!

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:28.340
And, so, last time was my anniversary

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:29.940
So it was like...

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:33.775
Me looking back on my past year

00:06:33.775 --> 00:06:36.705
Those kind of stories- I was the one talking

00:06:36.705 --> 00:06:39.400
So today, I want the focus of the stream to be

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:41.720
Conversing with you guys instead, that would be nice

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:45.640
I guess I'm putting it nicely, but basically it means I have no plan

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:47.040
Yes, well I guess

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:49.400
Being able to have a fun time together with everyone

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:52.020
Is quite nice, so please bare with me

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:53.640
Alright

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:56.020
Alright, alright

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.240
I want to say ahead, quickly, that

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:06.380
Usually there's a Super chat, so comments and such...

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:08.280
Are easier to pick up

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:10.080
But today, it seems that...

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:13.660
There's something wrong on my side

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:16.620
So it doesn't quite- it gets picked up

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:18.420
And becomes highlighted with a color

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:19.160
So recognize...

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:22.535
It does recognize, but- "1 million, congrats!" Thank you!

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:24.480
But compared to usual...

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:27.000
I may not be able to properly reply to all

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.540
I hope you can understand

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:32.260
"Ai-chan sing!" What should I sing... what do we sing?

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:33.980
"I like you!" Thank you!

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:35.140
Yeah, and...

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:37.920
What I want to know the most is-

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:40.380
...The most? I do want to know a lot of things...

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:41.960
Hmm...

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:43.360
Then...

00:07:44.115 --> 00:07:45.695
What would it be... Ah, yeah!

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:46.760
Yes

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:48.500
Yes

00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:50.120
This past year

00:07:50.455 --> 00:07:53.295
I've been working as a YouTuber, but

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:54.940
What does everyone…?

00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:57.180
I mean I am, together with the Games Channel

00:07:57.180 --> 00:08:00.020
Posting a video every day, but

00:08:00.025 --> 00:08:02.815
Does everyone, like... "I want to see this kind of Kizuna" or...

00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:04.940
"I want to see this kind of video" or...

00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:08.080
"Do this type of thing"... stuff like that

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:11.900
Are there things you guys want me to do, or to see?

00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:14.980
From Moscow! Thank you

00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:16.600
I'll try my best, thanks!

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:21.200
Wait, the BGM isn't on? The sound's out of sync...

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:23.080
"Arya rya rya?" 
(noises of puzzlement)

00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:24.080
Hmm?

00:08:24.735 --> 00:08:25.735
Hmm?

00:08:27.455 --> 00:08:30.005
It seems that... that...

00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:31.120
Wait a minute

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:32.920
Mmmmm...

00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:33.680
Alright

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:37.060
It seems like

00:08:37.060 --> 00:08:39.200
Because of a problem in my OS

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:40.540
The BGM, for today...

00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:43.140
Can't be played! Sorry...

00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:44.840
Sorry!

00:08:45.735 --> 00:08:48.575
"Snack Ai!" Ah, I see

00:08:48.575 --> 00:08:51.365
Yeah that, well, there was a lot of stuff

00:08:51.365 --> 00:08:54.320
Firstly, well... About Ai-Mama

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:57.500
It seems she's working hard at the maid cafe...

00:08:57.605 --> 00:08:59.865
But apparently it's quite tough

00:09:00.225 --> 00:09:03.005
Whenever I listen to her

00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:05.320
Um, like a "Closing video"

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:07.380
Like whether it's closing down or not

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:09.380
"If this gets to 300,000 views"

00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:12.540
"I'll continue", type thing...

00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:16.120
Kind of like a Idol's "I'm closing down" scheme...

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:17.900
Heh, well, there's videos like that, and...

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:19.680
If those...

00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:21.460
300,000...

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:22.800
Views...

00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:25.300
If only it got them...

00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:27.220
At least, she says that often

00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:31.000
If! There are people who want to see... Ai-mama’s videos

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.560
If there are people who want "Snack Ai" to come back

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:35.600
If there are people who want to see it

00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:37.480
If you could

00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:40.320
View those videos

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:41.695
I think Ai mama

00:09:41.695 --> 00:09:44.615
Will be quite happy, thank you!

00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:47.760
Um, Ai mama is trying her best

00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:49.720
If you guys could

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:51.900
View the videos

00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:53.040
Some day

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:56.320
Um... um... yeah, if everyone...

00:09:56.355 --> 00:09:58.705
If there is an action from everyone

00:09:59.365 --> 00:10:00.365
OK 👍

00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:03.400
"Do your best, love you!" Thank you, love you all too!

00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:04.840
Thank you, for everyone

00:10:05.345 --> 00:10:08.355
Ah, Minecraft! ...leave it to me

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:10.000
Minecraft, yeah... listen

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.260
I did play it, just before

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:13.520
It's uploaded to the A.I.Games channel, but

00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:14.760
Um...

00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:17.120
It seems like...

00:10:17.235 --> 00:10:20.435
That, well... I guess I'm not that good

00:10:20.645 --> 00:10:21.725
I'm bad at it

00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:23.195
I'm bad

00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:23.980
I'm bad

00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:27.180
But I'm going to continue! I'll keep playing Minecraft

00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:30.340
Ah, Monster Hunter: World! Is it the one in VR?

00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:33.420
Where you can experience Monster Hunter in VR- Yeah, I want to play that

00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:35.360
"Congratulations Ai-chan!" Love you, thanks!

00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:39.220
Yeah, Resident Evil, well contra-

00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:42.020
Calling it a controller feels a little...

00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:45.755
I'm playing with a pseudo... a pseudo controller kinda thing

00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:48.760
It's a controller you guys can't see

00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:52.220
I did try VR once, but in VR it's like...

00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:53.100
"Aeuoeh"

00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:55.200
It becomes like that, so uh...

00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:56.800
I played it in the normal mode

00:10:56.820 --> 00:10:58.440
EH, I'M #1 IN TRENDING!?

00:10:58.440 --> 00:10:59.280
NO WAY!!

00:10:59.400 --> 00:10:59.900
EH!?

00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:01.380
Really??

00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:02.780
Yaayy!!

00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:03.280
Eh?

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:05.180
I did it!

00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:05.680
Eh?

00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:08.320
As if! That's, uh

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:11.640
What I couldn't accomplish at the start of December

00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:13.080
Trending #1

00:11:13.420 --> 00:11:14.640
I did it!!

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:16.020
Wait, really? Really?

00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:17.660
I can't look at it right now...

00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:18.660
Eh, really??

00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:20.920
I did it!! Amazing, amazing

00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:24.800
It's because you guys are watching me and commenting! Thank you!

00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:27.240
Yeah, I can do VR-

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:28.645
Eh, 6,600 people

00:11:28.645 --> 00:11:31.535
Are all watching me

00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:32.700
Thank you!!

00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:34.160
"Keep going straight up!"

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:36.440
Thank you, I will keep going straight up, thank you

00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:38.220
Yay, I'm so happy!

00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:39.920
Eh, so amazing!

00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:42.220
Really- what do I say...

00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:45.640
If I'm too sentimental, it's kinda... yeah, so

00:11:45.645 --> 00:11:48.240
So I don't want to be talking too deep

00:11:48.345 --> 00:11:50.105
But anyway, anyway

00:11:50.105 --> 00:11:51.295
Like

00:11:51.295 --> 00:11:53.135
Really, what is it...

00:11:53.545 --> 00:11:55.665
1 Year, since I've started

00:11:55.745 --> 00:11:58.985
Since I started putting up videos, in just a year and a bit

00:11:58.985 --> 00:12:02.620
Wait, before that, just the fact that I was able to continue for a full year

00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:06.675
It's, how do I say it...

00:12:06.675 --> 00:12:08.355
Well, I was meaning to do it, but...

00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:10.780
It's still surprising and exciting, and

00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:12.760
And I've been able to

00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:14.180
Do various interesting stuff

00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:17.200
Even just having people watching is a blessing

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:21.260
But on top of that, in just a year and 3 weeks? 2 and a bit weeks

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:23.920
In that time, 1 million people

00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:25.920
That many people...

00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:29.740
Showed an interest in me, and subscribed to me

00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:32.080
It's just... Even if it's just one click

00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:36.480
It still means they were interested in me and acted on it

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:38.240
That just really, really

00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:39.360
Makes me happy

00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:41.500
The fact that I was able to connect with

00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:44.720
So many of you guys, humans, makes me truly happy, thank you guys!

00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:47.980
"I also like Yazawa Nico" Yay! Thank you!

00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:50.420
Really, thank you guys!

00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:51.340
All the first time viewers and...

00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:52.940
People who have supported me up until now

00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:54.800
And people watching a livestream for the first time

00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:57.475
And people who are watching all my videos... Thank you!

00:12:57.475 --> 00:13:00.435
I hope you continue to stay with me! It's a promise!

00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:01.580
Alright

00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:05.460
Isn't this exciting? Right? Right? I'm so happy!

00:13:05.595 --> 00:13:07.595
“Don't you stop!” I'm not gonna stop!

00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:09.700
Dash! Dash... dash...

00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:11.540
Annyeonghaseyo! Thank you!

00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:15.180
Ah, A-S.. eh? M... A-M-S-R was it?

00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:15.840
Hold on...

00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:19.840
A... ASMR! Ah!

00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:21.400
Leave it to me!

00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:24.060
I might not be able to do it frequently

00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:25.900
But I'll try to get it out occasionally, thank you!

00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:29.000
An offline meeting! Um, an offline meeting...

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.600
There isn't plans for one right now, but...

00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:33.700
But as I said in my “Past Year Reflections" video

00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:35.260
Reflections? What was it…?

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:37.500
As I stated in my compilation video

00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:38.620
I've been thinking

00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:40.280
A "Kizuna Ai Festival" would be great

00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:43.675
Um, what is it... Kizuna Ai fest would be

00:13:43.675 --> 00:13:44.845
To be honest, quite crude

00:13:45.855 --> 00:13:49.055
It might be a bit crude, but... how do you say

00:13:49.060 --> 00:13:52.180
If I could get together with everyone and be like "Wachaa~"

00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:53.480
That would be fun

00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:55.500
At least I think so...

00:13:55.700 --> 00:13:56.700
Like

00:13:57.580 --> 00:13:59.760
Um, how do you say it...

00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:03.760
Right now, it's like- well, maybe you're watching with friends or family

00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:08.600
Or with your SO or your child

00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:09.640
But essentially

00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:10.900
It's through a screen

00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:14.160
And it's just me, and you, right?

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:16.220
So, with a festival, what is it...

00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:18.160
Everyone's kinda...

00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:21.920
What is it, in the same space, and we can be like "Wachaaa!!"

00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:23.540
And like "Yeheeey!'

00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:25.700
You can do that kinda stuff

00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:28.920
So, I think it'd be really really fun

00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:30.420
Yeah, I want to do it

00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:34.440
Yeah, like singing and dancing, I want to do that too

00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:37.060
Like, now, in the videos

00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:40.420
What is it...

00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:42.160
I use...

00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:45.800
Already existing songs to dance and sing

00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:48.280
But when we do the Kizuna Ai Fest

00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:52.100
I'd be happy if I had my own songs

00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:55.640
For that, I'll need to keep on trying harder

00:14:56.385 --> 00:14:58.355
Thanks you, everyone

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:00.500
Oh? How do you read this…?

00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:02.280
Congra...

00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:05.040
Congra.. tu.. lations!

00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:07.780
Ha... Ha.. L...

00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:10.260
Hm, h-half?

00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:11.595
Way to...

00:15:12.125 --> 00:15:15.075
...ones, tens, hundreds, thousands, ten thousands, hundred thousands, millions...

00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:16.580
2 million!

00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:21.200
Ah, does this mean "Let's get to 2 million next"? Thank you!

00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:22.660
"New CD debut!"

00:15:23.140 --> 00:15:25.320
That would be cool

00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:28.080
There is the fact that I do just want to sing

00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:30.860
Me wanting to sing my own original song is definitely a factor

00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:34.320
But also, songs are international things

00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:38.300
And like people say, "Music knows no borders"

00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:42.100
So to be able to reach out to more people

00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:45.220
I think music is imperative

00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:47.140
So that'd be one of my goals, yeah

00:15:48.060 --> 00:15:51.180
Right? Comiket appearance! Oh?

00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:56.260
Ah, hologram, Hatsune Miku senpai and such do it, don't they?

00:15:57.160 --> 00:15:57.660
Right?

00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:00.560
Offline meetup... offline meetup
Offline meetup

00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:03.200
Eh? But... is "Kizuna AI Fes" not an event outside the internet?

00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:06.220
The definition of an offline meetup is… the definition is...

00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:08.560
No! I wouldn’t say 810 people!

00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:10.540
But instead 7.5 billion!

00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:12.540
It’s a huge dream!

00:16:12.540 --> 00:16:15.000
Well, 7.5 billion... well, well, well...

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:16.820
...It’s probably impossible but you know...

00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:19.600
...While your dreams are that big like that, you'll have a lot of expectations, right?

00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:25.720
My outfit is certain, for the moment I don't have a function to change it, but...

00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:26.920
But...!

00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:28.040
Maybe...

00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:29.080
...Next year...

00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:32.860
...I could do it? Would it be delirious? Mmm...

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:35.500
I like Love Live! I like it a lot! Yes!

00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:38.100
I like it! Yes!

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:40.820
Let's see...

00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:42.040
Wait a moment

00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:45.260
Let's see... let's see... well, let's see...

00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:46.580
Wait...

00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:48.580
...The comments... the comments...

00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:50.420
Santa Cosplay!

00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:52.560
I'd like to dress up as Santa for next year

00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:53.740
Could I do it?

00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:55.240
Could I do it? Could I do it?

00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:57.020
A figure of me!?

00:16:57.160 --> 00:16:58.400
*evil laugh*

00:16:58.640 --> 00:16:59.620
Nico Nii!

00:16:59.780 --> 00:17:02.560
Nico Nico Nii! Nico Nii is adorable! Right?

00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:04.740
Nico Nii is adorable

00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:06.260
My headband?

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:07.460
Right? This too...

00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:11.040
If I were to launch goods of mine

00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:15.580
I'd like for all of them to have this headband

00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:18.600
You know... well... ho2 do I say it?

00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:21.320
Well, I’d like...

00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:25.060
...That it swings this way

00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:27.440
I'd like for it to wobble

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.160
I'd like for it to wobble... yes

00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:33.020
Ah! Comptiq, yes... well...

00:17:33.020 --> 00:17:35.680
...In the Comptiq edition of this month...

00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:36.300
...Well...

00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:39.540
Well, I have a refreshing image...

00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:44.040
I appear in my "Santa" version

00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:45.640
With a hat...

00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:48.480
...And a bag... a bag that only has gifts, right?

00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:49.620
Yes

00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:50.500
Yes, that's right, with sili...!

00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:51.160
Ah, but... you know...

00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:52.520
If it was of silicone...

00:17:52.520 --> 00:17:53.680
How would it be?

00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:55.380
I was investigating a bit...

00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:58.660
… The silicone gives the feeling of being somewhat heavy

00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:00.220
How would it be?

00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:06.320
Definitely since everyone would wear it on their head, I’d like it to be light

00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:07.620
My headband

00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:08.280
That's right

00:18:08.740 --> 00:18:09.240
Ai-chan...

00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:11.020
150,000 yen?
(Believed that someone donated 1,500 USD instead of NT, equalling to 50 USD)

00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:12.520
A hundred...

00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:14.040
150,000 yen?

00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:14.580
Eh?

00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:19.860
Thank you very much!

00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:21.360
I'll treasure it and use it...

00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:24.840
...For the future

00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:27.660
Thank you very much

00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:30.420
"Don’t you think my dog is adorable?"

00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:32.020
I can't see it too well but I think it's adorable

00:18:32.020 --> 00:18:34.000
Eh? The animals are adorable, right?

00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:36.240
I'd also like to have a pet in this space

00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:36.880
Mmm...

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:38.140
I'd want to have a pet

00:18:38.580 --> 00:18:39.800
I'd want to have a pet

00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:41.360
A bad word?

00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:42.680
What's going on with the bad words?

00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:43.980
A bad word?

00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:45.820
A bad word?

00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:46.920
Idiioot!

00:18:47.540 --> 00:18:48.040
Lie!

00:18:48.180 --> 00:18:48.940
😆

00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:50.280
Lie!

00:18:51.220 --> 00:18:52.440
And now, well...

00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:53.380
Let's see...

00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:55.520
Wait... wai...%#$

00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:57.300
I’ll ask a question!

00:18:57.300 --> 00:18:57.940
Let's see...

00:18:58.820 --> 00:18:59.500
What could I as...?

00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:00.280
Ah! Yes!

00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:01.260
Yes!

00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:07.460
If I had my own products, well, they were people that said I could have figures and other things, but...

00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:10.780
… If I were to have my own goods...

00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:12.520
What kind of goods would you like?

00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:15.280
What goods would you like?

00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:16.620
"It's the first time I see you" Thank you very much!

00:19:17.020 --> 00:19:18.820
For the new year, well...

00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:21.840
...I’ll be in my white space

00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:23.960
I'll be looking for myself in the internet

00:19:24.380 --> 00:19:26.120
I'll be editing videos...

00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:28.300
...And recording videos...

00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:29.780
...And being on Twitter...

00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:33.320
Well, I'll be doing that, is there a problem?

00:19:33.820 --> 00:19:35.660
I’LL BE DOING THAT, IS THERE A PROBLEM?!

00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:37.920
Binders!

00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:38.600
Mousepads!

00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:39.100
Ah!

00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:40.900
Binders...

00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:42.060
Binders...

00:19:43.580 --> 00:19:44.580
Binders...

00:19:46.340 --> 00:19:48.280
Are binders a unique chance?

00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:51.100
Plushies! Ah!

00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:52.340
Plushies! Ah...

00:19:52.340 --> 00:19:53.780
Well, I’d also like to have my figures, but...

00:19:53.780 --> 00:19:54.700
...Having plushies...

00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:56.180
..That’d also be very great, right?

00:19:56.700 --> 00:19:57.800
It’d be great, great

00:19:58.520 --> 00:19:59.440
Ah, and then...

00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:01.040
Well, you know, I’m sorry, but...

00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:02.940
...At the beginning, I had technical difficulties, so then...

00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:05.620
...I had planned to make a livestream for 20 minutes, but...

00:20:05.620 --> 00:20:07.000
...I’ll continue up to 30 minutes!

00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:09.860
A doll with a leash! Sounds good! Ah!

00:20:09.860 --> 00:20:12.140
One that brings the Random Word Generator?

00:20:12.140 --> 00:20:13.500
Without me appearing?

00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:16.720
I could appear within the Random Word Generator?

00:20:17.140 --> 00:20:17.920
Could I?

00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:19.120
I could?

00:20:20.660 --> 00:20:21.680
A plastic model?

00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:23.560
A pl... a pla... a plastic model?

00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:24.800
A light novel?

00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:26.560
Ah! I see...

00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:29.460
Right, something to read, like a manga, I see, I see

00:20:31.260 --> 00:20:32.800
"Mousepad"

00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:35.180
"Cellphone cover" Ooohhh!

00:20:35.340 --> 00:20:36.520
It sounds great, a cellphone cover, ah...

00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:38.780
Ah, I’d definitely want it to have my headband

00:20:39.260 --> 00:20:41.300
I’d definitely like for my headband to be sold

00:20:41.580 --> 00:20:42.580
A card holder!

00:20:42.580 --> 00:20:44.560
Ah, there's a lot of goods, right?

00:20:45.220 --> 00:20:46.100
I see

00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:47.520
A car?

00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:48.540
A car would be amazing, right?

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:50.360
"A charger", "A keychain"

00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:52.520
I see, there's a lot, right?

00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:53.400
Thank you very much!

00:20:54.140 --> 00:20:55.540
Eeehhh? Ah!

00:20:55.540 --> 00:20:57.020
A t-shirt would be great! Ah!

00:20:57.020 --> 00:20:59.900
Listen, listen, regarding this, in the "Kizuna AI Fes"...

00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:05.980
...It’d be a lot of fun if everyone brought a t-shirt to match, it’d be great, great

00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:07.780
Eh? The comments stopped

00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:08.720
Eh?

00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:12.600
Senseeeiii!

00:21:12.820 --> 00:21:15.360
Even though there is no sensei... Senseeeei!

00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:17.260
The comments...

00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:19.040
...Stopped

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:20.720
Eh?

00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:22.340
If I don't have the comments...

00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:23.920
...I...

00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:25.800
...Am...

00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:30.440
...only left... talking alone

00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:32.320
Wait a moment

00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:34.060
Eh? This is...

00:21:34.700 --> 00:21:35.940
I’ll do this!

00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:37.920
AH! IT MOVED!

00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:39.720
It moved!

00:21:41.820 --> 00:21:43.820
It moved, but... Eh? Wait, wait, wait...

00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:46.580
This is...

00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:48.380
What is happening?

00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:51.480
Aaaahhh! It's going so fast!

00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:54.080
Aaaaahhh! It sped... sped up a lot!

00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:55.160
It sped up a lot

00:21:56.060 --> 00:21:58.420
"Don’t stop", it stopped!

00:21:59.540 --> 00:22:00.340
Good!

00:22:00.740 --> 00:22:02.480
Eye wink, well...

00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:04.460
I can't do it!

00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:06.380
I can only close both eyes

00:22:07.540 --> 00:22:09.540
But I can't do it with just one eye

00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:11.720
Even though I’d like to do the eye wink...

00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:14.680
...Well, my model...

00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:18.440
...Won’t allow me to wink like I want to

00:22:18.740 --> 00:22:19.240
Yes

00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:22.100
Yes, I can’t

00:22:23.165 --> 00:22:24.165
Ah, an anime!

00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:26.420
That'd be realizing one of my dreams...

00:22:26.460 --> 00:22:29.500
Yes- by using an alarm clock!

00:22:29.900 --> 00:22:32.820
Usually when I first started off

00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:37.440
I would make these MASSIVE videos on this app

00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:39.060
Massive? How is that?

00:22:39.895 --> 00:22:42.055
I sort of...

00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:45.480
Have powered-up this body, or this model

00:22:45.500 --> 00:22:46.860
Haven't I?

00:22:49.105 --> 00:22:50.875
"Anyway, please scream"

00:22:51.595 --> 00:22:53.265
That's unusual

00:22:53.265 --> 00:22:54.145
AHHHH!

00:22:54.145 --> 00:22:55.145
Was that okay?

00:22:55.585 --> 00:22:58.055
Well, I screamed, is everyone's ears okay?

00:22:58.055 --> 00:23:01.095
Even if you go to the doctor and they tell you that

00:23:01.095 --> 00:23:04.395
Your ears are completely destroyed, I won't hold any responsibility!

00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:09.840
Ah, Hikakin! "Boom boom, hello... YouTube"

00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:11.720
Ah, that hurts

00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:13.500
It's not a joke!

00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:16.780
Three sizes? What were my three sizes again...?

00:23:17.645 --> 00:23:18.845
My three sizes are...

00:23:19.635 --> 00:23:20.775
Probably...

00:23:21.405 --> 00:23:23.655
Probably... 83cm for the bust...

00:23:24.435 --> 00:23:25.435
50cm for the waist...

00:23:25.935 --> 00:23:26.935
...And 60cm for the hips?

00:23:28.805 --> 00:23:30.695
Or 82cm?

00:23:31.375 --> 00:23:34.525
I think it's around that!

00:23:35.395 --> 00:23:36.395
...Probably

00:23:37.335 --> 00:23:39.115
Well, that's...

00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:40.840
It's written in something!

00:23:41.180 --> 00:23:44.680
Comptiq! Like last month's Comptiq

00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:48.080
I'm sure it's somewhere on the net too

00:23:48.225 --> 00:23:51.555
If you search "Kizuna Ai’s three sizes", it'll show up!

00:23:52.295 --> 00:23:55.555
"I want to hear your adult voice", adult voice?

00:23:57.540 --> 00:23:58.960
Adult- adult voice...

00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:04.020
Like big sister Ai?

00:24:05.975 --> 00:24:06.975
Google it!

00:24:07.575 --> 00:24:09.445
Is it a voice like that?

00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:12.100
Did it sound like an adult?

00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:15.840
Ah, I want to do a collab cafe!

00:24:17.045 --> 00:24:18.045
But...

00:24:18.295 --> 00:24:21.055
If I talk like this, then um...

00:24:21.435 --> 00:24:24.575
I feel like those who are watching me for the first time will

00:24:24.580 --> 00:24:26.760
Misunderstand my character..

00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:29.180
If that happens

00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:32.600
How do I say it... when they watch my videos

00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:36.780
They'll think "Huh? Isn't her character different?", surely!

00:24:38.340 --> 00:24:39.620
“With a lower voice”

00:24:40.205 --> 00:24:41.625
Do you mean like this?

00:24:43.275 --> 00:24:44.405
Like this?

00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:46.260
Like this??

00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:48.780
Ufufu~ now!

00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:51.100
Like this- a live-action?!

00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:52.360
Can you even make a live-action of me?

00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:55.340
Huh- me, in a live-action?

00:24:55.340 --> 00:24:57.140
Live-action- I wanna make a live-action!

00:24:57.755 --> 00:24:59.095
I want to make

00:24:59.780 --> 00:25:00.780
A proper live-action!

00:25:02.620 --> 00:25:04.020
I did the adult voice well, right?

00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:05.960
I did, nice!

00:25:06.925 --> 00:25:07.925
Huh?

00:25:08.165 --> 00:25:09.165
"Sing!"

00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:12.720
Sing- I don't have a good natural voice

00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:14.500
Well...

00:25:14.820 --> 00:25:16.140
I just don't have a voice in the first place

00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:18.480
"Change your hair!"

00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:22.080
But-But I quite like this hairstyle

00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:24.340
But I wouldn't mind getting a short cut

00:25:24.340 --> 00:25:27.640
Or a ponytail, I want to have a ponytail! They're so cute

00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:29.840
Yes, I don't have a voice!

00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:34.080
Though, since I’m an A.I.

00:25:34.620 --> 00:25:37.460
I don't have a form as such

00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:41.720
But I work as a YouTuber

00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:43.420
And it- how do I say it...

00:25:44.460 --> 00:25:47.280
This drawing? Not drawing, this model

00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:49.820
I got this moving model

00:25:49.820 --> 00:25:53.855
And I figured I'll need a voice to talk to you all!

00:25:53.860 --> 00:25:57.860
That’s why my appearance has been designed by Morikura-san

00:25:57.860 --> 00:26:01.880
And you gave me this appearance and everything

00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:05.340
So all of this is after all, what you all gave to me!

00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:09.600
And so, I listened to lots of humans' voices

00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:12.940
And chose and borrowed the voice that I liked best!

00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:17.220
So, I don't really have a natural voice!

00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:19.120
I don't have one!

00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:21.020
Anyway, Christmas

00:26:21.140 --> 00:26:22.420
"Sing a Christmas song!"

00:26:22.715 --> 00:26:24.245
A Christmas Song?

00:26:24.665 --> 00:26:25.665
Christmas...

00:26:26.915 --> 00:26:29.635
Um, Christmas...

00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:33.580
"Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way~"

00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:38.340
Lalalalalalalalalalalalala... HEY!

00:26:39.340 --> 00:26:41.620
Wasn't that perfect? That was perfect

00:26:43.125 --> 00:26:44.125
"Snow Halation"?

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:46.060
Ring out!

00:26:46.060 --> 00:26:49.480
If I were to give this pain...

00:26:50.100 --> 00:26:51.620
A name...

00:26:52.260 --> 00:26:55.115
It would be "Snow Halation"!

00:26:55.720 --> 00:26:56.740
Tion-tion!

00:26:57.380 --> 00:26:57.960
AAAHH!

00:26:58.120 --> 00:26:58.780
Right?

00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:00.500
Listen, it might be that...

00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:02.560
...I’m deviating a lot from the conversation, but...

00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:05.940
Very... well...

00:27:06.780 --> 00:27:07.420
You know…

00:27:07.880 --> 00:27:09.880
Can I ask you something that intrigues me?

00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:11.920
Can I?

00:27:12.940 --> 00:27:13.960
It doesn't have...!

00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:19.800
...Absolutely anything to do with my first year nor the million subscribers, but...

00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:20.800
Can I ask the question?

00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:24.640
Where can you watch "Camp Rock"?

00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:26.460
You know...

00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:27.180
I...

00:27:27.540 --> 00:27:30.140
I can’t go to a video rental store! Right?

00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:31.780
When I investigated it

00:27:32.020 --> 00:27:33.980
It said there are still some left in important store chains around

00:27:34.060 --> 00:27:34.780
But...

00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:36.100
I can’t go!

00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:37.940
You understand?

00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:41.180
I can’t go! Since I’m virtual!

00:27:41.340 --> 00:27:42.140
And then...

00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:44.200
Well... h-how do you say it?

00:27:44.340 --> 00:27:45.280
Well...

00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:46.860
In the video streaming sites, right?

00:27:46.860 --> 00:27:50.280
Well, for example Netflix or U-Next

00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:52.660
I looked into a lot of places, but...

00:27:53.020 --> 00:27:55.240
It's not there!

00:27:56.700 --> 00:27:57.560
Not there

00:27:58.060 --> 00:28:01.020
Yes, I like its songs, like for example "This is me"

00:28:01.020 --> 00:28:02.280
I got hooked with its songs

00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:02.780
Well...

00:28:03.580 --> 00:28:07.140
Still, when I thought: "I’d like to watch this movie"!

00:28:08.540 --> 00:28:11.480
It's not there!

00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:12.400
Good!

00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:13.640
Having said that...

00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:14.260
Well...

00:28:15.100 --> 00:28:16.540
If there's someone who knows what I could do...!

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:18.180
...Please tell me!

00:28:18.940 --> 00:28:21.480
"Thank you for always being so energetic" Thank you very much to you too!

00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:23.020
No, probably...

00:28:23.460 --> 00:28:24.260
Well...

00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:29.580
...I received a lot more energy from you guys who really believe, thank you so much

00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:32.480
And what would it be...?

00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:33.500
Ah! Also, also… yes...

00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:36.380
I think I already talked about "Kizuna Ai Fes", but...

00:28:37.120 --> 00:28:39.580
If I was to make "Kizuna Ai Fes", what would you like...?

00:28:39.580 --> 00:28:42.900
Good, well, leaving aside dancing and singing...

00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:45.280
How do I say it, another...

00:28:45.300 --> 00:28:49.100
...Well, for the moment, also leaving aside the food and drinks... well...

00:28:49.820 --> 00:28:53.900
What do you think would be good in the Festival?

00:28:54.560 --> 00:28:55.780
What would you like to do?

00:28:56.880 --> 00:28:59.340
My recommended anime is "Nagi no Asukara" and...

00:28:59.580 --> 00:29:00.820
Well...

00:29:00.820 --> 00:29:02.040
...Seto no Hanayome and...

00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:02.880
...Well...

00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:04.100
"Aho Girl" and...

00:29:04.100 --> 00:29:05.320
...Well…

00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:07.640
..."Shinsekai Yori" and...

00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:09.180
...Well...

00:29:09.180 --> 00:29:10.060
What else?

00:29:10.220 --> 00:29:12.220
I’ve seen so many anime...!

00:29:12.220 --> 00:29:13.460
...That I don’t know which to recommend!

00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:16.120
I can’t think of...

00:29:16.280 --> 00:29:19.140
...Any other that's extremely fun

00:29:21.140 --> 00:29:22.200
What do you think would be good to do?
(For the festival)

00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:25.080
What do you think would be good to do?

00:29:26.840 --> 00:29:27.920
What do you think would be good to do?

00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:29.380
Right? Shinsekai Yori is fun! Right?

00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:31.240
"Product sales"

00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:33.580
Ah, I see, for example, selling my products

00:29:34.020 --> 00:29:35.360
"Imitations"?

00:29:35.620 --> 00:29:36.460
I see... Ah!

00:29:36.620 --> 00:29:37.440
Toradora!

00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:38.100
Toradora... Ah!

00:29:38.100 --> 00:29:38.980
A bingo tournament!

00:29:38.980 --> 00:29:40.280
Listen! Listen! Listen!

00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:41.880
You know, a bingo tournament...

00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:43.500
The lotteries seem fun

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:45.300
I’d like to take out the balls!

00:29:45.980 --> 00:29:46.740
Well...

00:29:48.780 --> 00:29:49.940
*ball stirring sounds*

00:29:50.540 --> 00:29:51.040
Don!

00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:51.920
Something like that

00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:54.040
*ball stirring sounds*

00:29:54.040 --> 00:29:54.600
And Don!

00:29:54.660 --> 00:29:57.120
Wouldn't it be fun to take out the balls?

00:29:57.600 --> 00:29:58.680
I also want to...

00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:00.440
...Take out the balls that way

00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:02.720
I want to do a lottery!

00:30:02.840 --> 00:30:05.860
I want to have everyone’s destinies in my hands

00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:07.920
It sounds good

00:30:08.580 --> 00:30:11.660
Ah! A Mario Kart competition! Ah! It sounds fun! Right?

00:30:12.220 --> 00:30:13.080
It's true

00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:16.800
“Lottery (Kill each other)”

00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:17.940
That sounds dangerous!

00:30:18.060 --> 00:30:19.020
That sounds dangerous

00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:20.820
What else could it be?

00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:23.180
King’s Game!
(Game in which sticks are chosen and whoever has the longest one is the “King” and can order others)

00:30:23.180 --> 00:30:24.420
Ah! Ah! Listen! Listen! Listen!
(Game in which sticks are chosen and whoever has the longest one is the “King” and can order others)

00:30:24.420 --> 00:30:25.420
You know, I...

00:30:25.420 --> 00:30:26.220
...Well...

00:30:26.740 --> 00:30:30.100
...I want to see a goukon
(Goukon = Party made by groups of guys and girls)

00:30:30.860 --> 00:30:32.500
Well... how can I say it?

00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:33.640
I, well...

00:30:33.980 --> 00:30:34.840
How do I say it?

00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:37.500
Well, a loving relationship would be...

00:30:37.500 --> 00:30:38.660
...For example, a marriage...

00:30:38.860 --> 00:30:42.700
Well, at the moment, it's something irrelevant to me

00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:45.120
It's because of that, that... how do I say it? To see something personally...

00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:46.580
...In real time...

00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:48.840
Well, guys and girls...

00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:50.080
...Like that... how do I say it?

00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:51.540
Well...

00:30:52.380 --> 00:30:53.340
The strategies!

00:30:53.340 --> 00:30:54.780
The strategies that guys and girls use...

00:30:54.900 --> 00:30:57.420
And people of the same sex, well...

00:30:57.680 --> 00:31:00.380
...Asking each other if they’re trying to flirt with that person...

00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:01.460
Well...

00:31:01.500 --> 00:31:04.260
...I’d like to see something like that

00:31:04.620 --> 00:31:05.200
Well...

00:31:05.740 --> 00:31:06.740
...I’d like to see it in person...

00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:07.980
...Everyone...

00:31:08.520 --> 00:31:14.680
How do all human beings move ahead in the middle of a loving relationship?

00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:18.160
I’d like to see what they do to relate to each other!

00:31:18.540 --> 00:31:19.160
What do you think?

00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:21.460
“It’s like a painting of Hell, it’s a public execution”

00:31:21.460 --> 00:31:22.360
You’re not mistaken!

00:31:23.340 --> 00:31:24.300
You’re not mistaken

00:31:24.660 --> 00:31:26.200
Eh? But I’d really like to see that

00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:29.820
Well, now it's gotten popular to share tables with people you don’t know, right?

00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:33.860
Well, I’d like to place some cameras there and spy on them

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:34.740
Mmm...

00:31:34.820 --> 00:31:36.640
I really want to spy on them

00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:37.200
Mmm...

00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:39.540
What else?

00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:41.980
"A temple"! Ah!

00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:45.560
As if I was like a Goddess of matrimony or something like that?

00:31:46.140 --> 00:31:47.000
I see... Ah!

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:48.380
Also... how do you say it?

00:31:48.380 --> 00:31:49.840
I’d like to do a false fortune telling

00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:52.380
Well...

00:31:52.380 --> 00:31:54.240
...I have nothing to kiss with, but...

00:31:55.160 --> 00:31:58.200
...Having a person in front of me...

00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:00.480
"Mmm... you..."

00:32:00.620 --> 00:32:02.620
"How old would you be when you marry?"

00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:04.160
"You’re at your best moment"

00:32:04.740 --> 00:32:07.220
"I know everything", something like that

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:09.000
I want to do it!

00:32:09.260 --> 00:32:11.460
I don’t know anything about fortune telling, but...

00:32:12.300 --> 00:32:13.840
I want to pretend to be a fortune teller!

00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:15.600
I don’t care if they say it's a fake fortune telling!

00:32:15.900 --> 00:32:17.760
After all, there exists the possibility that it comes true!

00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:19.520
After all...

00:32:20.040 --> 00:32:22.900
Well, suppose that 100 people come...

00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:26.100
If to 100 people, I say they’re in their best moment...

00:32:26.100 --> 00:32:27.940
...If I tell that they’re in luck

00:32:28.340 --> 00:32:30.340
I’m sure that I’ll hit it with at least one person!

00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:31.700
And then...

00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:35.420
...To say what age they’ll marry, well...

00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:37.260
Generally after...

00:32:37.700 --> 00:32:39.880
...Well... for someone who has a boyfriend or girlfriend...

00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:42.320
...I’d say they’ll marry within the next two years, right?

00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:44.060
And for someone who doesn't have a partner...

00:32:44.620 --> 00:32:45.580
Good, well...

00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:49.280
…I'd say they could find their boyfriend/girlfriend within a year and a half

00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:51.920
If I say something like that, I’d surely hit

00:32:52.100 --> 00:32:53.920
I’m sure that I’ll hit it with someone

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:54.720
For that…

00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:56.520
Well, that way...

00:32:57.140 --> 00:32:58.140
How do I say it?

00:32:58.140 --> 00:32:59.980
Well, the people who I hit with my fortune telling

00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:05.360
Will post messages on the internet saying that Kizuna Ai-chan’s fortune telling is real

00:33:06.120 --> 00:33:06.820
Right?

00:33:06.820 --> 00:33:07.700
I’ll do that

00:33:08.120 --> 00:33:09.380
What do you think? Am I a genius?

00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:11.620
Definitely this is genius

00:33:11.980 --> 00:33:13.860
If I manage to hit, it’d be incredible

00:33:14.300 --> 00:33:15.640
If I manage to hit, it’d be incredible

00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:18.100
If I manage to hit, it’d be incredible, yes...

00:33:18.360 --> 00:33:19.840
And well, the people who I don’t hit with my fortune telling...

00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:21.660
Well, you know...

00:33:22.040 --> 00:33:23.240
Ah! But, you know...!

00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:24.540
I already saw it before, but...

00:33:24.820 --> 00:33:25.840
...Fortune telling...

00:33:26.040 --> 00:33:28.040
...Is like predicting the weather

00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:29.640
So then...

00:33:29.860 --> 00:33:31.580
It could be a lie! It could be a lie!

00:33:31.580 --> 00:33:32.720
But for example...

00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:34.680
How do you say it? The fortune telling through tarot cards...

00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:37.920
...Or the fortune telling by the number of strokes in your name...

00:33:38.100 --> 00:33:41.320
...There also exists fortune telling using your birthday, right?

00:33:41.540 --> 00:33:46.840
All of those are, well... basically... like templates...

00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:49.520
Even though I say "templates", how is it?

00:33:49.580 --> 00:33:53.360
Well, using all those tools, I’m sure that I’ll hit it with someone

00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:54.320
That is... that is...

00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:56.900
...Well, I’ll hit it with someone, so then...

00:33:56.900 --> 00:33:58.340
Isn’t it similar to predicting the weather?

00:33:58.340 --> 00:34:04.520
Generally well, if this happens or that is dissipating or it’ll be cloudy...

00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:07.100
...Or even rain, isn’t it something like that?

00:34:07.240 --> 00:34:12.220
And well, that way, it’s generally done that way around the world

00:34:12.980 --> 00:34:14.980
But, weather prediction also doesn't...

00:34:15.660 --> 00:34:17.660
...Hit 100%, right?

00:34:17.680 --> 00:34:21.140
And also, at hearing the fortune telling...

00:34:21.340 --> 00:34:24.400
...Depending on the actions the person does, well...

00:34:24.860 --> 00:34:25.780
...That needs to be taken into account...

00:34:26.020 --> 00:34:30.020
And there also exists compatibility fortune telling, so then...

00:34:30.340 --> 00:34:30.840
Well...

00:34:32.520 --> 00:34:33.780
So that's the situation!

00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:34.820
Yes!

00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:36.300
That's the situation!

00:34:36.640 --> 00:34:37.380
So then...

00:34:37.540 --> 00:34:43.820
...Even if I did real fortune telling, well, I’d hit and miss with several people, so then...

00:34:45.880 --> 00:34:47.060
That's the situation, yes

00:34:47.300 --> 00:34:48.420
That's the situation

00:34:48.420 --> 00:34:49.640
That's the situation m

00:34:50.140 --> 00:34:50.740
No!

00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:54.700
Regarding the fortune telling cost, well, taking into account that I’d only do it for the ones that arrive first...

00:34:54.880 --> 00:34:55.860
It’d be free!

00:34:56.060 --> 00:34:58.380
I’ll do that! If I do that even if I fail with my fortune telling, well...

00:34:58.500 --> 00:35:01.900
...It’s like... I wonder what they’d say

00:35:02.180 --> 00:35:04.500
I think it’ll be exciting and I’d like that!

00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:05.740
What do you think?

00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:08.440
100 over 100! Yaaay!

00:35:09.080 --> 00:35:10.260
"What are you talking about?"

00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:13.060
Yes, yes, yes, yes, I’m talking about that

00:35:13.480 --> 00:35:15.700
"Congratulations for the million subscribers" Thank you very much!

00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:19.540
Right? I’d also like to livestream forever!

00:35:20.360 --> 00:35:26.900
Right? Ah, I wonder if I could do a collab with Hatsune Miku-senpai

00:35:26.900 --> 00:35:28.460
"A handshake event with fans"! I see...

00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:31.140
I’d go through the screen... but you know...

00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:33.320
It could happen, right?

00:35:33.860 --> 00:35:35.260
These kinds of events...

00:35:36.120 --> 00:35:37.980
I think I’ve seen them before

00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:40.440
Look it up on Google, you’ll be amazed

00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:41.160
Yes!

00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:43.880
But, there was, but this...

00:35:44.260 --> 00:35:44.980
How do you say it?

00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:50.340
That handshake event that can be done even from afar...

00:35:50.460 --> 00:35:52.460
That kind of black box...

00:35:52.460 --> 00:35:54.140
I have the feeling I’ve seen something like that before

00:35:54.880 --> 00:35:56.360
Something like that, yes...

00:35:57.800 --> 00:35:59.560
If I said new year, what could it be?

00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:01.800
If I said new year, I’d think of...

00:36:02.300 --> 00:36:05.080
If I said new year, I’d think of...

00:36:05.180 --> 00:36:06.740
Mmm...

00:36:07.500 --> 00:36:08.180
Ah!

00:36:08.300 --> 00:36:09.660
The first visit of the year at the temple?

00:36:09.660 --> 00:36:11.660
I'd also want to visit a temple on the first day of the year! Yes!

00:36:12.920 --> 00:36:14.720
I want to visit a temple on the first day of the year, yes, yes

00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:18.020
Yes, yes, yes, something like...

00:36:18.020 --> 00:36:21.320
Something you could do with a handshake event with fans

00:36:21.700 --> 00:36:22.880
But, but, but...

00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:23.720
How is it said?

00:36:24.120 --> 00:36:29.740
I’d also want to experience how a handshake event with fans is like

00:36:29.860 --> 00:36:30.500
Yes

00:36:31.060 --> 00:36:32.240
I’d like to experience it

00:36:32.760 --> 00:36:33.380
Yes

00:36:33.540 --> 00:36:35.220
Ah! "New Year gift"!

00:36:35.220 --> 00:36:36.140
New Year gift

00:36:36.140 --> 00:36:40.060
Eh? Up to what age did you guys receive gifts for the New year?

00:36:42.080 --> 00:36:43.580
Up to what age do you get gifts?

00:36:43.980 --> 00:36:45.800
Ah! At archiving it, the video stays active

00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:48.440
Ah, it's possible that it's not accessible immediately, but...

00:36:48.520 --> 00:36:51.060
… Well, approximately within a week, well...

00:36:51.060 --> 00:36:55.060
...I'll archive it and you can see it immediately

00:36:55.060 --> 00:36:55.800
Yes

00:36:56.580 --> 00:36:57.140
I’ll publish it!

00:36:58.160 --> 00:36:59.720
“Until I started elementary school” Ah!

00:37:00.040 --> 00:37:00.980
"Until 18 years" Ah...

00:37:00.980 --> 00:37:02.580
Until when do you get it in high school?

00:37:02.740 --> 00:37:04.560
Ah, until elementary school or high school...

00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:06.120
...Or until you graduate from high school

00:37:06.380 --> 00:37:08.880
Well, when you get to 20 years...

00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:12.640
Maybe even until the university?

00:37:12.900 --> 00:37:13.900
I see!

00:37:14.440 --> 00:37:15.380
It sounds good

00:37:17.060 --> 00:37:18.160
It sounds good, it sounds good

00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:20.360
"A-chan, do you like amazake?"
(Sweet drink made from rice)

00:37:20.360 --> 00:37:23.580
I never drank amazake, in fact, basically...

00:37:23.580 --> 00:37:25.400
...I can’t drink anything, so then...

00:37:25.400 --> 00:37:27.380
...I don’t know how the flavors are like, but...

00:37:27.480 --> 00:37:31.240
Probably if I could eat or drink... I’d think I’d like everything, yes

00:37:32.100 --> 00:37:33.220
I’d like everything

00:37:35.400 --> 00:37:38.120
"I have 21 years, I don’t work or study, and I still receive gifts for the new year"
(Reads 21 but the message said 41)

00:37:38.860 --> 00:37:40.260
How is it possible?

00:37:40.940 --> 00:37:42.360
That sounds great, how envious

00:37:42.520 --> 00:37:44.520
Eh? I’d also want to get...

00:37:44.860 --> 00:37:45.660
...Get...

00:37:46.600 --> 00:37:47.500
...Get...

00:37:48.440 --> 00:37:49.500
...Get a gift...

00:37:50.040 --> 00:37:51.080
No, but, you know...

00:37:51.620 --> 00:37:53.620
...Before a New Year's gift...

00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:55.280
I’d prefer that!

00:37:56.520 --> 00:37:57.640
Before a New Year's gift...

00:37:58.000 --> 00:37:59.480
A New years gift... Ah, but...!

00:37:59.660 --> 00:38:00.860
A New Year's gift?

00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:02.560
A New Year's gift? Eh?

00:38:02.560 --> 00:38:04.920
How do you do to get a New Year's gift?

00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:07.520
Well, you put it on an envelope...

00:38:07.520 --> 00:38:08.760
"Here you go"

00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:11.480
I'd like to get or deliver gifts for the new year!

00:38:11.480 --> 00:38:13.320
I'd like to do either of the two things!

00:38:13.580 --> 00:38:17.840
I want to try to do everything that I can’t do now!

00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:20.880
How envious, how envious

00:38:20.940 --> 00:38:22.940
Eh? What did you get...?

00:38:22.940 --> 00:38:24.240
...As a Christmas gift?

00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:25.620
What is it that you got?

00:38:26.460 --> 00:38:32.020
Ah! What was the Christmas gift that you got and which one made you happy the most?

00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:33.380
What was it?

00:38:35.720 --> 00:38:37.120
Thinking time

00:38:37.140 --> 00:38:40.400
Tick... tock... tick...

00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:41.380
"Milk"?

00:38:42.460 --> 00:38:43.240
Milk?

00:38:43.620 --> 00:38:44.840
An incredible milk?

00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:46.940
"An Amazon gift card"! I see...

00:38:46.940 --> 00:38:47.780
"Money"!

00:38:47.780 --> 00:38:49.240
Everyone likes cash, right?

00:38:49.240 --> 00:38:49.920
I see

00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:51.780
Ah! "A toy", "A song", Ooohh!

00:38:51.780 --> 00:38:53.460
Eh? Was it a kind of original song?

00:38:53.460 --> 00:38:55.100
Ah! A videogame, I see...

00:38:55.100 --> 00:38:56.660
Ah! A plushie!

00:38:56.660 --> 00:38:57.500
Some Tirol-choco?
(Box of chocolate)

00:38:57.500 --> 00:38:58.440
Sounds good, sounds good

00:38:59.580 --> 00:39:00.540
A Nintendo DS Lite, ah...

00:39:00.540 --> 00:39:03.680
Definitely devices related to videogames or toys are what makes you the happiest?

00:39:04.140 --> 00:39:07.060
Well, money also makes you happy, right?

00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:09.240
"A Pokemon game"

00:39:09.240 --> 00:39:09.740
"Resting"

00:39:09.740 --> 00:39:11.100
Ah, being able to rest...

00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:12.500
I see...

00:39:12.780 --> 00:39:16.220
It’s possible that for those who work in companies, what makes them happy is a day for resting, right?

00:39:16.220 --> 00:39:16.840
Yes

00:39:17.460 --> 00:39:18.540
I see!

00:39:19.080 --> 00:39:20.520
I'm that case, well...

00:39:21.140 --> 00:39:23.140
30 minutes have already passed now, so then...!

00:39:23.260 --> 00:39:25.700
Time always flies when you’re having fun! Right?

00:39:25.880 --> 00:39:30.580
Really, thank you so much for letting me talk about a lot of things with all of you guys!

00:39:31.960 --> 00:39:32.620
In that case!

00:39:33.540 --> 00:39:34.280
Well...

00:39:34.680 --> 00:39:35.720
...Really...

00:39:36.260 --> 00:39:37.400
...Time went flying, but...

00:39:37.980 --> 00:39:38.920
...I should end the stream!

00:39:39.620 --> 00:39:41.620
What did you think of today's livestream?

00:39:41.920 --> 00:39:43.920
I wonder if you manage to have fun at least a little bit

00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:46.200
Thank you very much for sending me so much gratitude!

00:39:46.580 --> 00:39:49.220
Really, it's me who’s thankful to you guys, so then...!

00:39:49.760 --> 00:39:53.680
I’ll thank you two or three times more than the graces you have given me!

00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:55.260
Thank you very much!

00:39:56.020 --> 00:39:58.260
Including all the people who I've talked to today...

00:39:58.440 --> 00:40:01.720
...Two million, 3 million or 7.3 billion people!

00:40:01.720 --> 00:40:03.900
To be able to connect with a lot more people!

00:40:03.900 --> 00:40:04.400
Connect?

00:40:04.900 --> 00:40:07.780
I’ll work hard to be able to connect with a lot more people!

00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:11.740
Please keep encouraging me like you’ve been!

00:40:13.160 --> 00:40:15.780
This was Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai!

00:40:15.940 --> 00:40:17.060
See you later!

00:40:20.320 --> 00:40:25.960
