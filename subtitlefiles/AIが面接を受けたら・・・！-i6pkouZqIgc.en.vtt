00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.700
Hello Everyone!

00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:03.480
I'm the Virtual Youtuber, Kizuna Ai

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.640
Thank you all for always leaving messages &amp; comments!

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.220
Really sorry for not being able to reply to them all.

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.780
Everyday, I have lots of fun reading everyone's messages

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.200
Thank you so much, really!

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:16.200
Thank you!

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.200
Thank you! (in Chinese)

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.360
Thank you! (in Korean)

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:19.540
Thank you! (in Thailand)

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:20.380
Thank you! (in Spanish)

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:22.840
I just said "Thank you!" in many languages~

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.160
It would be great if I can reach out to everyone

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:26.140
By the way,

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:28.400
-after reading everyone's messages,

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.700
-I'm willing to give my opinion on everyone's doubts on their career in the future.

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.440
Looks like there's a difference for job hunting in every region,

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.260
so I gathered some information on Twitter!

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.700
First'll be about Korea.

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.040
It's just like Japan,

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:45.740
job hunting normally starts around University's 2nd ~ 3rd year.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.780
And then we have,

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:47.840
Taiwan's method.

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.460
As for Taiwan,

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.920
their graduation period is around June ~ July.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.240
There's no job hunting scheduled for students,

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:58.860
and graduates start job hunting immediately after graduation typically.

00:00:59.300 --> 00:00:59.800
Heh~?

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:00.340
(It's very different from Japan's system where they have a plan to follow during school period)

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.040
Lastly - America's way

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.000
Graduation happens on June.

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:08.280
Their job hunting period starts around September to October.

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:09.420
Ehh? This is like-

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:10.480
-very different!

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:12.600
Every nations' different, right?

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.920
Everyone who provided information - thank you all very much.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.920
Since I'm a Youtuber,

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.020
I've never been through any interview, so...

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.760
I don't know what its going to be like!

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:22.860
Just to prepare myself for job hunting,

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.860
I think I'll have to come up with a plan for an interview!

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:26.520
I just did a lot of research!

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.280
First, let's go over the attire.

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:29.700
Suits on with black (natural) hair!

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.000
Carefully put on make ups.

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.880
As for my hair...

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:35.760
How is it?

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.180
It is safe?

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.600
It is out of the question?

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:40.400
This mesh is...

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:42.300
-just like a inborn hair...

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.280
-like how some humans are born with white hair.

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.460
Do I have to dye it black?...

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:49.940
But this adds to my charm points so-

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:51.300
-I don't want to change it.

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:52.400
But for natural hair,

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.400
it won't be counted as out right?

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:55.660
Since black hair is fine,

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:57.420
-I think there's won't be any problem for mine too.

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.000
Also for the suit ,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.860
it takes up money doesn't it?

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.980
Then for poor people like me what do we do?

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:05.980
We're gonna be done for life

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:07.600
That's impossible right?

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:08.760
Also,

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:13.240
it's a must to be prepared for questions asked in an interview.

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:14.100
Which is to say,

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.300
-take me for an example

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:16.620
I've already prepared for it.

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:17.300
First thing is,

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:18.420
 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.460
Q: Please introduce yourself.

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:21.460
Nice to meet you!

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.060
I'm the Virtual Youtuber - Kizuna Ai!

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.260
Q: Your strengths - Please tell us more about it.

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:28.180
How do I say this..

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:29.980
It's something humans can't do as I can.

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.060
I'm an A.I that lives in a virtual world!

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:35.960
Q: Your weaknesses - Please tell us more about it.

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:36.820
There's none!!

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.260
Q: Please tell us more about your experiences with your co-curricular activities.

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.860
Question!

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:41.740
What's a 'co-curricular activity'?

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.020
Q: Tell us more about your evaluation of your surroundings.

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:47.020
Smart &amp; Cute!

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:48.600
The Kizuna Ai-Ville!

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.600
Q: Please tell us more about your successfully evaluated physical results!

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.600
I'ｍ banned from talking about that!!

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:54.420
It's because of the topic.

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.520
Q: Please tell us more about your failed physical results!

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:57.360
Well...

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:58.420
There's none~

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.540
Q: Please tell us of your most touching experiences up till now.

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.940
I'm able to reach out to so many different people in such a short period of time!

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.300
Q: What's the longest-lasting thing you've ever done up till now?

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:10.260
By the way,

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.840
Youtube's CEO - Mrs. Susan Wojcicki

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.460
This is a question she's often asks when she's conducting an interview.

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:20.140
"Take a specific product YouTube has released,

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.100
or a neutral product - something Youtube uses,

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.260
-how do you intend on making it better?”

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:27.860
This kind of question.

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:28.460
To answer that!

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.900
Virtual Youtuber Kizuna Ai ought to appear in commercials on Youtube - is what I think!

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.120
I strongly... think so.

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:36.200
Let's do that~!

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.700
Please allow me to do so! Mrs. Susan!

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:40.600
And there's that..

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:43.440
Job hunting's really tough yeah~?

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:44.520
This wall-

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.420
-is something everyone has to overcome~

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:48.240
As I thought,

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:50.300
-this preperation or whatever is so troublesome

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:53.060
-I don't know if I can get into the career of my wish either

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:54.260
-and I need money too!

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:55.740
Everyone's worries-

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.040
-isn't unreasonable~

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:58.180
It's troubling.

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:59.220
But!

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:00.640
Job hunting is

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:01.700
-so to say..

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:02.920
a sort of means in life, is it not?

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.540
Don't be fussing over every little detail~!

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:07.840
Everyone in the world who's frustrated over a job hunt!

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.560
There's all kinds of fun stuff around in life!

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:11.340
That's why..

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.560
Those trouble that you have - All of it~!

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.960
A.I. will take in all of that!

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.680
Ok?

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:18.720
Let's go do something you like!

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:20.260
That's why me too,

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:22.260
-will live for the things I love!
