00:00:18.239 --> 00:00:22.377
Hi, I'm Trevor. And I'm the best third wheel in the world.

00:00:22.377 --> 00:00:25.087
I third wheel my friends, my pets,

00:00:25.087 --> 00:00:27.961
heck, I third wheel my parents ever since I was born!

00:00:27.961 --> 00:00:31.100
Now I know what you're thinking,
why would anyone WANT to be a third wheel?

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:32.782
Being a third wheel SUCKS.

00:00:32.782 --> 00:00:38.781
But where others only see the drawbacks of being singled out,
I see the value of a truly kick ass third wheel

00:00:38.781 --> 00:00:40.734
"And I ROCK at it!"

00:00:40.734 --> 00:00:42.202
&nbsp;

00:00:42.202 --> 00:00:46.422
Aww, don't they look so cute today. But sometimes, selfies aren't enough.

00:00:46.422 --> 00:00:49.711
I don't just help them take a picture.

00:00:49.711 --> 00:00:53.489
"Landscape, Portrait, One for safety, Flash, No Flash, High angle,

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:59.204
Full body, Touch-two! I'll even pick the filter for you. Go with Mayfair."

00:00:59.204 --> 00:01:00.651
&nbsp;

00:01:00.651 --> 00:01:04.105
"Buy one get one free" deal making me feel left out?
 Pshh As if!

00:01:04.105 --> 00:01:10.105
More like buy none get TWO free! Drink up~ go ahead.

00:01:14.297 --> 00:01:17.973
Sidewalk too narrow for 3 of us?
Every third wheel knows you have to walk a few steps behind.

00:01:17.973 --> 00:01:22.382
But I'm not every third wheel,
I'm the best third wheel in the world.

00:01:22.382 --> 00:01:26.305
I stand a whole block behind!

00:01:26.305 --> 00:01:31.138
"Y'all good up there?
Alright, Take a LEFT! okay?" Great

00:01:31.138 --> 00:01:34.771
&nbsp;

00:01:34.771 --> 00:01:39.435
Wow, looks like these guys are going to need a designated driver.

00:01:39.435 --> 00:01:42.189
But I'm not complaining, I'm making the wine recommendations.

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:44.688
"You'll love this Chardonnay,
 '97, excellent year."

00:01:44.688 --> 00:01:48.890
Uh oh. Was that Pauline's ex that just walked in?

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:54.890
&nbsp;

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.793
This could totally ruin the night.

00:01:56.793 --> 00:01:58.190
But I don't just break the tension...

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:00.097
&nbsp;

00:02:00.097 --> 00:02:02.917
I remove it. Shhh

00:02:02.917 --> 00:02:06.837
And while they both "go to the bathroom" to make up...

00:02:06.837 --> 00:02:08.441
I'm not awkwardly waiting, annoyed.

00:02:08.441 --> 00:02:11.045
I put up candles and David Choi back there.

00:02:11.045 --> 00:02:11.639
&nbsp;

00:02:11.639 --> 00:02:14.047
"Don't mind me~"

00:02:14.047 --> 00:02:15.347
"Oh yeah"

00:02:15.347 --> 00:02:20.097
&nbsp;

00:02:20.097 --> 00:02:24.803
"Hey Drew's mom, He's... 
busy right now, but he loves you and..

00:02:24.803 --> 00:02:27.369
Has lately been thinking about
his relationship with you and wishes

00:02:27.369 --> 00:02:29.041
He could go track all the years
that he took you for granted

00:02:29.041 --> 00:02:31.475
And regrets not spending more time
with you when he was young and impressionable

00:02:31.475 --> 00:02:34.787
And now if there's one thing that he could do to say sorry
and help you by being a better son

00:02:34.787 --> 00:02:37.487
'kay, good night.

00:02:37.487 --> 00:02:40.687
You're welcome, Drew

00:02:40.687 --> 00:02:43.331
&nbsp;

00:02:43.331 --> 00:02:46.341
Awkward cab ride forcing me to sit in the front alone?

00:02:46.341 --> 00:02:49.350
I don't just sit with the cab driver.

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:50.907
I AM the cab driver.

00:02:50.907 --> 00:02:52.788
Where to?

00:02:52.788 --> 00:02:53.977
&nbsp;

00:02:53.977 --> 00:02:59.637
And finally, at the end of the night,
when everyone wants to get all cute and mushy.

00:02:59.637 --> 00:03:03.321
Usually this is the worst moment for all third wheels.
But not me.

00:03:03.321 --> 00:03:06.029
I don't get uncomfortable.

00:03:06.029 --> 00:03:08.940
I get extremely comfortable.

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:13.109
&nbsp;

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:16.877
So next time you feel ashamed about
being a third wheel, think about me.

00:03:16.877 --> 00:03:20.375
Before you complain,
consider how important your role is.

00:03:20.375 --> 00:03:26.093
I salute all those out there like me 
who's selfless sacrifices go overlooked,

00:03:26.093 --> 00:03:28.893
But, we know it's ....

00:03:28.893 --> 00:03:34.893
&nbsp;

00:03:43.227 --> 00:03:45.627
La Quinta Rueda!

00:03:45.627 --> 00:03:51.627
&nbsp;
