00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.820
Explosiooooon!

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:03.720
Cough, cough, cough

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:06.480
Hello everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna AI here!

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:07.560
Man, everyone...

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.340
Explosiooooon!

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:10.860
Did you notice something?

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:13.200
For those that understood

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:14.660
You're very perceptive

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:15.580
That's right!

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:17.020
In April, started...

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:18.240
...Hiragana Oshi’s explosion!

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.580
...Of Hiragana Oshi!

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.380
The explosion!

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:22.120
Man...

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:25.340
...Hiragana Keyaki showed their allure, right?

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:26.680
They have some great masters of ceremony

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:28.380
They have some great masters of ceremony in the program

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.120
They have some great masters of ceremony in the program!

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:31.940
I'm also a great master of ceremony, but...

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:33.340
...I’ll give the honor to Audrey-san
(Audrey is a comic Japanese duo)

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:34.460
In Hiragana Oshi’s program...

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:35.800
...I wouldn't mind being a guest...

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:36.920
I want to appear!!

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.500
Someone as adorable as me...

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.840
...Doing a collab with the always adorable Hiragana Keyaki

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.500
Definitely...!

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.420
...The TV ratings would increase! Don't you think?

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:47.780
That’s right, they’d go up

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:49.040
It's because of that, that in this occasion

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:50.380
Thinking of TV Tokyo

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:52.040
Thinking of TV Tokyo!

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.460
In regards to Hiragana Keyaki, Keyakizaka...!!

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.300
I love theeeeem!

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.200
And I should demonstrate it

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:58.860
In this occasion...

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:01.940
...I’ll be doing something similar to what Kasuga-san of the comic duo Audrey did during the program...

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:03.940
I plan to do a profile introduction!!

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:05.680
And well, I’ll change a bit of the way it's done

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.440
Taking a name of a Keyaki-chan member...

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.280
...From the Random Word Generator...

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:10.200
...And that girl...

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.540
...For those that still don't know Hiragana Keyaki...

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:13.620
...I plan to introduce them to you...

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:17.020
...Briefly in a few words

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.040
I’d definitely would’ve liked to introduce all of them, but...

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.040
...For those that aren't so interested...

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:22.360
...It might be a bit too long, so then...

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:23.760
...I’ll choose one at random...

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.680
...And I, without mattering who it is about...

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:26.480
...In a perfect way...

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:28.800
...I plan to demonstrate how I can introduce them in a perfect way...

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.420
I plan to demonstrate my skill of doing introductions!

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.715
In that case, let's start at once!

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.860
A.I.Channeeeeeeel!

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:36.540
Here I go!

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.300
Jaka, jaka, jaka...

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.980
JHAN!

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:40.980
Oh!

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:41.680
In that case...

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:42.320
...Here I go

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.820
"I’m Saito Kyoko and I love ramen"

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.320
Good, in that case, it’s about Saito Kyoko-chan!

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:49.840
You know, Kyoko-chan...

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.560
...Is nicknamed "Kyonko"...

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:53.620
...And she loves ramen

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.680
She has a great voice

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:56.580
But...

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:57.900
...She seems very timid...

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:58.760
...And she's adorable

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.040
Her specialty is the babigo
(Fictional language similar to jargon in which the syllables ba, bi, bu, be, bo are added to the words)

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.900
Permit me to also do a demonstration of babigo
(Fictional language similar to jargon in which the syllables ba, bi, bu, be, bo are added to the words)

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:04.840
A-ba-DO-ba-RA-bi-BLE-bi

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:05.340
YAY!

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:06.540
Next up...

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.080
Jaka, jaka...

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.820
Jajajhan!

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:10.040
Iguchi Mao-chan

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.840
Here I go

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.660
She’s the oldest member of Hiragana Keyaki

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.280
She's the Unpredictable black hole idol
(Mao-chan says her stomach is like a black hole with how much she eats)

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.040
Oh! Isn't this delicious?
(Mao-chan says her stomach is like a black hole with how much she eats)

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.360
Man, you know, Iguchi-chan...

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.640
...Has a strong impact upon seeing her for the first time

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:22.180
And the more you learn about her...

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:23.880
...They have the biggest strength...

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.780
...And for now, they make sure to keep going forward without stopping

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:27.380
I recommend her

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:28.420
I’ll keep introducing more!

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:29.480
Jaka, jaka, jaka...!

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:30.280

...Really talented...

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.260
...And she's very intelligent

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.460
She's as intelligent as me!

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:46.020
And...

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:47.160
...For now...

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.300
...Her smile is super adorable

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:50.260
I recommend her, please

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.360
Jan, jaka, jaka, jaka...

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:53.220
JAJAJHAN!

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:54.660
Kakizaki Memi-chan

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.500
She’s the youngest member of Hiragana Keyaki

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.680
She’s an actress from the academy of the future!

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:59.360
Well, you know...

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:00.320

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:01.100
...And she's tsundere...

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:02.020
...She's adorable!

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.520
The drama of Keyakizaka46 called Re:Mind...

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:05.460
Please watch it!

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.240
So then you can comprehend why she’s an actress of the academy of the future

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:09.100
She’s adorable

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.200
Jan, jaka, jaka, jaka...!

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:12.080
JAJAJHAAAN!

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:13.700
Ushio Sarina-chan

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.080
Her nickname is Sarimakashi and she can speak Indonesian

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.680
Well, you know...

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:17.500
...Sarina-chan is...

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:18.000
...Adorable...

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.500
...She's very humble

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.160
Well, when she goes "Ha ha"...

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.960
You can feel a sense of femininity

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:22.920
Someday, I also...

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.400
...I’d like to hear a lullaby...

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:26.740
...At her side...

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:27.540
...A day where I can't fall asleep

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:29.800
Jaka, jaka, jaka, jaka...

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:30.700
JHUAN!

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:31.300
Oh!

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:32.800
Kato Shiho-chan

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:33.960
Her cap is adorable!

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:35.220
Toshi-chan is the best!

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:36.060
You know, Katoshi is...

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:37.360
Toshi-chan is...

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:38.160
...The best

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.940
She's the best

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.080
It’s rather important because of that, that I had to say it twice

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.960
She's the best!

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:42.740
That was the third time

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:44.000
Man!

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:45.100
What do you think?

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.000
My love for Hiragana Keyaki...

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.100
My love for Keyakizaka!

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:49.160
I was able to transmit it to you guys, right?

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.980
Probably, even the second generation...

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:52.100
...Even Kanji Keyaki...

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.220
...I have plenty of confidence that I can introduce them at random!

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.960
At any moment...

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:56.960
At any moment...

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:59.620
...I’ll be waiting for a job for a part of Kanji Keyaki or Hiragana Keyaki

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:00.900
I’ll be waiting for you!

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.040
It’d be a pleasure to work with you guys!

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:06.360
And also, for those that think you're tired of jokes regarding Keyakizaka

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:07.720
You're very perceptive

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:08.420
But...

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:10.080
...I want to talk about things that I like, so then...

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:13.660
...From time to time, let me talk about what I like every so often

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:16.000
