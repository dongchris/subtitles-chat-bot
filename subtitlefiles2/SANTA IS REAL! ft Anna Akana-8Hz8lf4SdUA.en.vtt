00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:07.803
Hey I just wanna say thanks again for letting me crash your Christmas party

00:00:07.803 --> 00:00:10.040
Hey now, no one should spend their Christmas Eve alone.

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:11.880
Ooh, milk and cookies, may I?

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.840
Uh...no, you can't - they're for Santa.

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:16.340
[Laughing] Okay.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.620
Geez, are you serious? What the heck?

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:20.900
You didn't tell him yet? Anna'll be here any minute.

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:21.820
Tell me what?

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:23.040
Uh...

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.300
Well, we have this friend, that uh-

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.680
Our friend Anna still believes in Santa Claus.

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:29.380
So don't screw things up.

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.720
Like, she believes in the SPIRIT of Santa, or...

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:38.120
No, uh, she believes in just Santa. The guy. Still.

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:40.160
What? How is that even possible?

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:41.420
I don't know.

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.060
This is morally wrong; I hope you guys know.

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:43.980
Somebody needs to tell her tonight.

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:48.560
No! Can you just imagine what that'd do to her? I mean, YEARS of holidays ruined.

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.020
Think about how deep-rooted this figure is in your life now. I mean-

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.180
[Proceeds to do a mindblown noise effect]

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:56.460
This is not an ordinary secret.

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:57.840
It doesn't matter, just-
[Doorbell rings]

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.200
Oh shoot. That's her.

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.180
Don't. Say. A word.

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:07.740
Wes: It's your favorite time of year!

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.880
Anna: Hello everyone!

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.280
Anna, this is Philip; he's spending Christmas with us because his family's out of town.

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.580
Aww...That is so sad

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.280
Don't worry though. I'm sure that the big guy up there

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.720
has some very special plans for you.

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:24.840
[Awkwardly] Well gosh, I hope so!

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:27.680
*gasp* Ohh, the milk and cookies for him!

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:35.220
Oh, you know every year. I wait, and I wait by the fireplace, but I just can't seem to stay awake!

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.980
Have you ever thought about, like, a video camera or something??

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:39.540
You know, I tried that one year,

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.880
but the whole tape was erased.

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.540
My parents said his sleigh probably causes some kind of

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.160
electrical disturbance in the air, but

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:51.899
I think it's magic.

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:53.799
*Whispering* Oh my god!

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.280
Uh, why don't we start, uh, Secret Santa? Yeah, everyone? Let's go.

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.100
Everyone ready?

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:02.340
Who's your Secret Santa?

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.020
Uh-uh! I can't tell you,

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.640
because that would be cheating,

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.080
and I have to stay on Santa's nice list.

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:09.780
Come on, I'm just wondering who, just-

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:11.100
That is so naughty.

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:12.680
I'm not gonna do that.

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.900
Dude, stop freaking out, just let me see-

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:15.760
He would know about it.

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.560
Philip: He doesn't know. He doesn't care.
Anna: He would know about it!

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.080
Philip: Just...you can show me!
Anna: He listens all the time!

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.940
THIS IS CALLED SECRET SANTA!

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.740
I am not gonna cheat in a game named after him!

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:28.760
What's going on?

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.300
Phil is trying to cheat.

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:35.440
Look, Phil. If you want coal in your stockings for Christmas,

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:36.640
be my guest.

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.980
But don't drag me off the nice list.

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:39.840
Anna, there's no-

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:41.740
-no reason to get upset.

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.880
Santa's no-
-not going to blame you

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.360
for Phil's bad behavior!

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.000
Because he checks that list twice, you know.

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:51.180
There's no Santa!

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:52.720
*everyone gasps*

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.940
There's no coal, there's no list,

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:59.600
There's no milk and cookies;

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:00.980
Santa's not real.

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.860
What did you say?

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:14.020
Anna...

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:17.980
There's not really a...

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.100
I'm just...I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said anything.

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:27.500
If you guys don't mind, um...

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.320
I'll just spend, like, a moment by myself.

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.160
[Door clicks shut]

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:37.320
[Low whisper] I'm sorry, I...okay, okay.

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.060
Hey Anna, uhm...

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.720
I'm sorry.

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:58.500
I'm sorry for ruining something, so special to you.

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:00.020
I feel awful.

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:06.560
But if you think about it, I mean, Santa is real. Right?

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:10.620
I mean, in our hearts, where it's the most important.

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:14.420
Right?

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.080
*laugh*

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.540
Oh my God, are you serious?

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:23.660
Wowwwwww okay.

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:25.720
What...the...

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:27.600
Hey, do you want some?

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.480
They keep these Christmas parties "dry"

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:32.180
so I don't accidentally do something "naughty".

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.960
Wait, so you don't actually believe that Santa Claus is real?

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:37.480
Dude, I'm twenty-five years old.

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:40.260
How the hell could I still think that Santa's real?

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:43.100
No, I just put on the act to mess with people.

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:46.360
You would not believe the hoops my friends jump through.

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:50.060
Ugh, I'm just getting such good stuff for Christmas every year.

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.420
Last year, they got me an iPhone and a trip to Hawaii

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:55.220
What?

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:58.420
That...is genius.

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:59.280
I know.

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:01.180
And you just ruined it for me!

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:03.520
Thanks a lot.

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:04.960
Sorry.

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:06.980
Ehh, it's okay.

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:08.400
I had a good run.

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:12.080
Come on, let's go back inside.

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:13.320
I think I can use this:

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:16.880
the sympathy from a traumatizing experience.

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:18.000
Oooh.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.800
Hey, did you put an Xbox on your Christmas wishlist too?

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:25.460
Yeah, I did that.

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:44.700
[Bells ring from Santa's attire]

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:57.460
*sobbing*

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:00.540
I'll remember you.

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:02.440
YOU'RE not real.

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:04.160
I don't believe in YOU.

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:06.020
You little troll.

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:09.500
*kicks*
*breaks*

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:11.340
I'm getting out of this place.

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:13.560
Rudolph!

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:16.520
I'm gonna go see [incomprehensible]
