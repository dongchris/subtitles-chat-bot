Hmm...

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.500
Our recommendation is...

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.620
Definitely the "Angel style Omuraisu by A.I.Channel", right?
(Omuraisu = Fried rice tortilla)

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:35.500
This Omuraisu was an idea that occurred to me

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.900
I’ll do a drawing dedicated to you, master

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.840
Of course, I’ll guarantee that it has an excellent flavor!

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.260
Even though I can’t eat...

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.180
In this case, what will be your order?

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:46.760
Yes!

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.860
One "Angel style Omuraisu by A.I.Channel", right?

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:52.300
Understood, master ♥

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.760
We have an order!

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:55.660
"Ai-chan really is an angel"!

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.100
In this case, wait a moment, please

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.240
Thanks for waiting!!

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.500
Here’s your "Angel style Omuraisu by A.I.Channel"!

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.240
The wings I drew on the plate are incredibly cute, right?

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:08.840
This is one of my best creations

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:11.860
Good, the moment you’ve been waiting, it's time to draw with the ketchup

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:13.460
Good, here I go

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.380
I have a lot of confidence in my drawing

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.780
Regarding my face, well... the most important thing is not the face but instead my headband, so then...

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.240
… I want to make sure that you can get the feeling that it's swinging

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:23.900
Good!

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:25.880
Is it like that? Ah, I think I messed up a bit

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:26.440
Good!

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.220
Ahhh... I finished!

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.260
Lastly, I’ll enchant it with a very valuable magic

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:36.360
Here I go!

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.100
Become delicious...

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.120
Moe, moe, kyun! ♪

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:41.940
Good!

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.700
This way, the special omuraisu became more delicious!

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.020
Bon appetit ♥

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.320
Good!! How about we take a commemorative photo?

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:49.880
Eh?

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.340
Are you ashamed, master?

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:53.440
Just me??

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:54.580
Ah, very good!

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.100
What kind of pose do you want?

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:57.080
An adorable one!

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.920
Understood!

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:58.840
In this case, I’ll work hard!

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:00.660
A.I.Channel ♥

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:02.160
Aaah!

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:03.840
You took a great picture!!

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:07.840
In this case, I’ll write a message here

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.160
Good, it's ready!

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.080
It's proof of our bond together so please take care of it a lot, a lot, okay?

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:19.060
Eh?

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.520
You were hoping to get the special course??

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.140
How demanding you are

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.960
In this case, master, which do you want?

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.100
Understood!

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.500
Uaahh... you already returned? Isn't that too soon?

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:32.960
Don’t you have work you need to do??

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:33.860
A seat?

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:34.820
Aaahh...

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:36.920
Why don't you sit over there?

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:39.980
Here you go, the omuraisu

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:41.140
Ah??

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.080
If I don't have an enchantment to make it delicious??

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.820
How annoying

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.760
If you’re hungry, anything will be delicious

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.260
Aaahh, you're still not hungry...

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.320
Good, in this case, I’ll take away your plate

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:53.140
Eh? Today is Pocky day?

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:54.160
And what does that have to do with anything?

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.440
A Pocky game

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:57.200
Eh?

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.560
Really?

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.020
Is it time to leave now?

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:04.340
Time passes when you’re having fun, right?

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.160
Come again when you want

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.240
I’ll always be waiting for you

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.400
In this case, have a good trip, master ♪

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:16.160
Man...

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.420
Even though it’s about the reopening of "Snack Ai"...

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:23.460
...Working in a "Maid Cafe" at my age was very hard, my head hurts

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:25.040
Ah

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.440
Welcome, master!
