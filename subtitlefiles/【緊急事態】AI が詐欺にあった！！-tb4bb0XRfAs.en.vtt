00:00:00.725 --> 00:00:04.175
Let's see... this is recording, right?

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:05.400
This is fine, right?

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:06.520
Good

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:09.340
Hello everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai here!

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:10.960
At the moment, I really find myself in trouble...

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:12.960
...I hurried to start recording, but...

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:15.340
...It’s the first time something like this happened

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.260
What should I do?

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.160
Please look at this!

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:24.400
*Thank you very much for registering! Your registration has ended, you will be charged 99,800 yen as a registration fee, if you wish to cancel the registration, call the following number*

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:27.920
While I was browsing the internet, suddenly this appeared

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.260
Did I press on some strange ad?

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.095
To make matters worse, it seemed to have signed me up automatically!

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.340
I can’t pay this subscription fee

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:39.220
What should I do? Really...

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:40.500
What should I do...

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.000
W-whatever...

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.340
...I should cancel the subscription

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.400
Let's see... the phone...

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.800
The phone number is...

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.040
Ah, here it is!

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:51.640
Ah, hello?

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.800
My name is Kizuna Ai

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.060
It seems there was a screen telling me that I registered

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.780
Yes

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.640
It seems that a notice appeared telling me of a payment

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:02.680
Yes

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:06.780
I’m sorry! It was just an error so then I’d like to cancel the subscription

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:08.960
Eh?

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:10.920
Eh? It's not possible?

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.760
No... no... well... that puts me in a bind

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.940
It was just a mistake and I can’t pay that subscription fee

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:19.080
Re... regardless...

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.240
You should cancel my subscription!

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.900
I can’t pay you money, I’m asking you, please!

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:25.520
Aahhh...

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.100
I wonder if everything will be alright now

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:29.040
*Incoming call*

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:29.620
Aaah!
*Incoming call*

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:30.500
*Incoming call*

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.240
Someone's calling me

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.060
It can't be!! It can’t be!!

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.360
What do you think of that?

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.440
This is what’s called "One Click Fraud"

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.200
It's known as "One Click Fraud"...

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.960
… To those frauds in which by only doing a click in a banner or link...

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.360
...It falsely tells the user that they’ve been subscribed...

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.300
...And will bill you a subscription fee

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.960
If you do it like her and talk to them to cancel the subscription...

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.780
...You run the risk of being insistently demanded to make the payment

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.460
The best way to deal with this situation is...

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:03.560
...To ignore it

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.820
Avoid contacting them completely!!

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.600
That's all

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.940
This was: "I tried to simulate a One Click Fraud experience"

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:11.120
See you later!

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.120
