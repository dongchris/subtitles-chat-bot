00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:35.580
Dang it!

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:36.440
Yeah!

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:38.040
Hey

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:41.320
Hi

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:42.320
Have we met?

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:43.900
No, I don't think so-

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.800
I don't think so either because I would of definitely remembered a beautiful face like yours.

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:47.840
Can I buy you a drink?

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.200
Whatever he's getting you, I can get you a much more expensive one.

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.440
You don't strike me as a kind of girl who's superficial like that.

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:54.020
Says the guy who still lives at home with his mom.

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:55.040
I just love me mom.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:56.480
Yeah, I'll have a whisky ginger.

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:57.100
No way.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.560
Thats- my favorite drink.

00:00:58.620 --> 00:00:59.120
Really?

00:00:59.120 --> 00:00:59.660
I'm Phil

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:00.300
I-I'm Chris.

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.120
I'm sorry, what was your name?

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.940
I love your earrings.

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:03.180
I love your ears.

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:04.620
And I love that dress, you look gorgeous.

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.980
Yeah, I would love to see that dress on your bedroom floor.

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:08.640
Excuse me?

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.840
Uh- because you had uh- just changed into your pajamas.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.800
I just think a girl looks the best when she's at home in sweats and t-shirts.

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.840
So do I, but I also appreciate it when a girl puts in the time and energy to look as

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.080
to look as stunning as you do.

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.440
For example, that nail polish, number 527 Chanel right?

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.840
Yeah, exactly.

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.180
What do you say we see each other again?

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:27.800
Uhh- I like your earring.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:29.400
Already said that.

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:29.980
Okay.

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.860
So what's your number?

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:31.960
It's 310-

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:32.880
I love those numbers.

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.920

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.100
Great, keep going.

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:36.360

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.500

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:41.440
Dang it!

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:43.680
And that's how your mommy and I met.

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:45.920
I love that story.

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:48.780
Hey, you wanna get ready for bed?

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:50.040
Okay.

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:52.880
Race you!

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:53.940
Pfft

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:00.300
I win!

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:02.320
Dang it!

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:06.220
Action.

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.540
Hi

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:10.040
Uh- Hi

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:12.240
Have we met?

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.260
No I don't think so. (laughter)

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:19.300
You know, I-I almost caught those last ones, if you just wanna tap it in there right-

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.820
Right-

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.580
You know what, it's just a couple I'll- I'll guess it.

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:25.900
Can't be that many iterations so I'll just give you a call when I figure it out,

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.220
Alright, have fun.

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.840
Two ginger whis- one ginger whisky.
