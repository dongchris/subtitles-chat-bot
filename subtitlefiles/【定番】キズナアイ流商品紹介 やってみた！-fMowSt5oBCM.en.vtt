00:00:04.675 --> 00:00:07.545
The first item I'd like to introduce today is this!

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:08.920
A 100 tonne hammer!

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:10.180
100 tonnes!!

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:11.720
It's 100 tonnes!

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:13.500
By the way, almost all of that weight is...

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.160
part of the head!

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.520
So the handle is quite amazing!

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.380
It's supporting 100 tonnes!

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:22.420
And I'm holding all 100 tonnes of it!!

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:24.020
I'm too amazing for my own good!

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.920
But I can't compliment this design enough

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:28.328
It's so easy to understand!

00:00:28.328 --> 00:00:29.229
It is obvious to see

00:00:29.229 --> 00:00:30.480
that it’s 100 tonnes, right?

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:31.731
Because it’s written there!

00:00:31.731 --> 00:00:33.066
This simplicity

00:00:33.066 --> 00:00:34.801
is unlike any other!

00:00:34.801 --> 00:00:35.602
This hammer

00:00:35.602 --> 00:00:37.404
is simple to use!

00:00:37.404 --> 00:00:38.630
You raise it above your head...

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.706
and go!

00:00:39.706 --> 00:00:40.860
How is that?

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.709
How easy!

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.060
What I’d like to introduce next is...

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:45.812
this!

00:00:45.812 --> 00:00:46.479
Glasses!

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:48.448
Please take a close look at them

00:00:48.448 --> 00:00:49.616
They’re so cute!

00:00:49.616 --> 00:00:51.117
Not wearing them…

00:00:51.117 --> 00:00:52.318
and wearing them!

00:00:52.318 --> 00:00:54.487
Either way it’s cute!

00:00:54.487 --> 00:00:56.656
And most importantly

00:00:56.656 --> 00:00:57.290
these glasses...

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:59.259
don’t improve your eyesight!!

00:00:59.259 --> 00:01:01.327
They’re only for appeal!

00:01:01.327 --> 00:01:03.963
Since I don’t have anything like sight!

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:06.690
The last thing I’d like to introduce is...

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:07.300
this!

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.369
The Random Word Generator!

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:10.480
You know...

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:12.539
it’s multi-purpose!

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:13.173
The first matter

00:01:13.173 --> 00:01:14.340
is of what it can do

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.809
What do you think it can do?

00:01:15.809 --> 00:01:16.509
That’s right!

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:18.178
It can do anything!

00:01:18.178 --> 00:01:18.912
On top of that,

00:01:18.912 --> 00:01:19.846
just like its name,

00:01:19.846 --> 00:01:21.081
it is random

00:01:21.081 --> 00:01:21.815
So whenever you think,

00:01:21.815 --> 00:01:24.520
“Ahh, there’s so many songs I want to sing!

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:25.785
“But I can’t decide which!”

00:01:25.785 --> 00:01:27.020
That happens a lot, right?

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.587
If you ask

00:01:27.587 --> 00:01:28.822
very kindly

00:01:28.822 --> 00:01:30.123
Clank-clank-BOOM!

00:01:30.123 --> 00:01:31.057
At complete random!

00:01:31.057 --> 00:01:32.926
It will give you

00:01:32.926 --> 00:01:34.594
various names of songs!

00:01:34.594 --> 00:01:36.196
And when you want to travel-

00:01:36.196 --> 00:01:37.397
which of course you will!

00:01:37.397 --> 00:01:39.232
Even if you only have half a day,

00:01:39.232 --> 00:01:41.534
if you want to go to Paris, or London,

00:01:41.534 --> 00:01:43.000
it will grant that wish!

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.471
This Random Word Generator

00:01:44.471 --> 00:01:45.972
can serve any purpose!

00:01:45.972 --> 00:01:47.140
It can do anything!

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.142
There isn’t one thing it can’t do!

00:01:49.142 --> 00:01:51.010
For this Random Word Generator...

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.644
Its price...

00:01:51.644 --> 00:01:52.479
is...

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:54.714
150,000,000 yen!

00:01:54.714 --> 00:01:55.315
So cheap!

00:01:55.315 --> 00:01:56.449
Way too cheap!

00:01:56.449 --> 00:01:57.016
However!

00:01:57.016 --> 00:01:59.352
It’s only on sale virtually!

00:01:59.352 --> 00:02:00.587
You won’t buy it, huh?

00:02:01.187 --> 00:02:01.488
OK!

00:02:01.488 --> 00:02:03.156
So, that's the introduction

00:02:03.156 --> 00:02:05.024
When you’re using the products I introduced you to today

00:02:05.024 --> 00:02:06.259
I’ll be super happy if you think

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:08.027
“ah, she was right!” and enjoy them!

00:02:08.027 --> 00:02:10.780
Anyway, this was Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai!

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.180
