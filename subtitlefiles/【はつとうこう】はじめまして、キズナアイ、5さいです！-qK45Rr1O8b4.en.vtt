00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:32.300
My favorite food is...

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:35.420
I've never eaten it but,

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.280
the vanilla flavor of ice cream

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.300

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.540
If you could try guessing what I'm drawing,

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:02.360
it will make me very happy!

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:03.600

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:30.540

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.000
I finished!

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.200
Were you able to

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.020
guess what I was drawing?

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:38.820
The answer is...

00:01:39.155 --> 00:01:40.195
a Shiba Inu!

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:41.480
a Shiba Inu!!

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.460
Those of you who got the correct answer,

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.300
did very well~!

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.860
Those of you who didn't get the correct answer,

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.020
should go help their mom and dad with some chores!

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.840

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.080

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:25.440

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.360
To finish the video,
