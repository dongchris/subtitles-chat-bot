00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:02.760
Hello everyone! Virtual Youtuber, Kizuna Ai here!

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.200
Recently, when I was surfing online...

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:08.960
There was this "mysterious emoji on your phone" that caught my sight

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:10.720
So this time!

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:13.800
I'm gonna look through all the mysterious emojis on your phone..

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.720
and I'm gonna teach you how to use it!

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:17.600
So without further ado, let's get going!

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.340
Random Generator, I'm gonna count on you!

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:20.720
Oh! Is this the emoji?

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.640
Gross.. It's if you think about a stalker sneak peaking behind a door..

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.680
It's like the stalker is looking directly at me..

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:26.440
That's gross

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:29.340
But well! If you wanna know when to use this emoji

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.200
Just leave it to me, the super A.I! It's a piece of cake

00:00:32.205 --> 00:00:33.335
If you ask me

00:00:33.335 --> 00:00:34.285
*JA JAN*

00:00:34.285 --> 00:00:37.680
Done! The text that suits this emoji is this!

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.380
Your face looks so dark today

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:42.100
Are you feeling sick?

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.320
So! How was it?!

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.540
If there's a person..

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:46.500
feeling sick and his face appears to be gloomy

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.440
Please use this emoji and care for him

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.240
Then move on to the next one!

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:51.260
Ooooooooh! Eh?

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:52.660
Wait.. this..

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.260
I can feel the insanity of a psychopath behind the mask

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.140
I see

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:58.560
A suspicious mask... mask..

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:01.360
Ah! I think I got this!

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.080
This looks gross, right?

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:04.660
This....I have an idea!

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:07.280
The text that suits this emoji... is this!

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.620
What colour of panties are you wearing today?

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:10.880
How was it?!

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:12.060
It's perfect, right?

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.860
The reason why this blue mask is grinning

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.280
It's like "I wanna know your panty colour"

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:19.960
And this yellow one..

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.215
After hearing the answer, its face is like "Oh... It's that colour...."

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.960
This kind of reaction!

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.360
Alright, let's keep on going!

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.860
This is like a SP (Security Police)  jumping?

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:29.660
Floating?

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:32.080
I see! This one is kinda tough...

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.500
I kinda wanna focus on the reason why he's floating..

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:36.780
Let me think...

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.540
Yes! Here we go..

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.120
The text suits this emoji...is this!!

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.380
I'm here to greet you from the future~

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.800
How was it?!

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:46.760
I feel like it'll greet me... in every sense of the word

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.000
So with that all being said..

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.700
So far we've seen all these weird emojis..

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:51.840
Actually!

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:52.780
When I was going through these..

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.120
I found this site that explains all the meaning of the emojis

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.940
So with this site..

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.700
Let's go check out and understand the meaning of all the emojis!

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:01.980
Hm...

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:05.025
Ah! There it is! New Moon

00:02:05.025 --> 00:02:06.020
with a face!

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.640
A new moon..

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:08.520
Shingetsu! (new moon)

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.280
New moon with a face

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.560
An anthropomorphic version of the New moon

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.660
Ooooooooh!?

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:15.900
A moon with a human face..

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:17.900
The first phase of the moon

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.900
The new moon occurs when the moon is closest to the sun..

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:22.700
I see!

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:25.100
Well..That's the face of the new moon!

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:26.100
This is probably...

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:27.700
Just a suspicious person right...?

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.380
This is like Thomas but with a different coloured face..

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:30.175
So..

00:02:30.175 --> 00:02:33.215
How about the one with the pervy mask

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.420
That gross otaku mask thingy....Ah! There it is!

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.540
A stage...Ah! I see!

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:39.940
I see! Eeeeh?!

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:44.260
The symbol of the tradition and classic stage art..

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:45.940
And both the masks represent it

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:47.700
One is smiling..

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.220
Smile! But that's kinda gross though..

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.220
The other one stands out

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:58.380
These 2 masks represent all the popular drama/story that was played on stage in front of huge amounts of audiences throughout history

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:59.180
I see!

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.160
The yin and yang for the story!

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:02.400
I see~!

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.340
I apologise for describing it as a pervy mask!

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.120
I'm sorry...Ok! Next!

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.480
I'm sorry I misrepresented and dissed the traditional art..

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:11.580
Then....Ah!

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:13.260
There it is!

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:14.720
Business suit...
*Man in Business suit floating*

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.820
This one confuses me the most!

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:18.020
Jump... That's all the description says..

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:19.200
Well, duh

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.260
While we're at it, let's check out other weird emojis too!

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:24.680
Is there any?

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.940
Ah! Alien Monster is cute!

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.020
A popular arcade game during the 80s..

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.740
Ehhh?!

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.840
It's similar....That's a rip-off, right?

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.680
What is a Besha? Besha...

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:37.380
Pager..

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:41.040
Pager is...? It was used before mobile phones became popular

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.535
Ehhhhhh.. This is my first time hearing the word pager

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:46.980
Maybe it was created even before pokeberu?

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.840
Eh? Which one? Pokeberu is....

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.840
Is it called a pager outside Japan? (Yes)

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:53.820
Ohhhhhhh..

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:56.440
Money and wings....This is cute~

00:03:56.445 --> 00:03:59.075
A dollar paper with wings

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:01.280
If you don't have a job

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:03.900
The money that you have will be...los...!

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.780
Isn't this like "Here comes the money"?

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.740
This is great~ Cute~

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.660
This emoji is your friend for those who need money~

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:12.580
Ya~ How was it?

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.360
I kinda clarified quite a few of the weird emojis

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.340
There was also surprisingly a lot of weird ones out there too

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.900
Please try it for yourself on Twitter or somewhere else!

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:23.980
Everyone, please also try using my examples too~

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:26.580
