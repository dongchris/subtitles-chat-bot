00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:02.860
Hello everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai here!

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:04.900
I've been really hooked with this app...

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:06.000
"Furare Kaihi" !
("Break-up Dodge")

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.880
Now that I understand a girls' feelings...

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.400
I plan on clearing it easily!

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:13.220
In that case, let's go right ahead!

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:15.380
♪ Te, te, ren ♪

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:17.420
*7th Stage: Fresh Pasta*

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:18.660
Eh? What? What?

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:19.260
Eh?

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.260
*BF: You're really so cute~♥*

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:21.920
Wait...

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:22.940
Hmm?

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.700
Isn't that a different girl?

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.820
Girlfr- Ah, it's the second girlfriend!

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.480
*GF2: Oh, you~ Aren't you saying that to all the girls?*

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.600
Well, he's definitely saying it to everyone, this person...

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.580
*BF: Those guys are the worst, they can't be forgiven~*

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:34.320
Haah!

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.200
That's you

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.280
*GF2: That being said, I love the place right ahead ♥*

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.020
“The place right ahead”....
*GF2: That being said, I love the place right ahead ♥*

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.840
Eh? The girls really trust you straightaway...

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:46.780
*BF: Yeah, their fresh pasta was delicious, wasn't it?*

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:47.440
Ah!

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.100
This is definitely a guy you shouldn't be together with...

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:51.520
"GF2: Eh?"

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.740
Ooooh…

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:53.920
That face exists

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.880
Other girlfriend... Ah! You’re an idiot! 
*BF: This is the place I went to with my other girlfriend!*

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:59.440
*GF2: Hey, this shop...*

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.560
"Fight"!

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.400
"This is the first time..." That’s right...
"GF2: This is the first time you've come here, right...?*

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:10.760
"Aah, I'm sorry! It wasn't with you....!"

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.460
And then I’ll say 'It was with a friend'

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:14.840
"GF2: ... Then, with whom did you go?"

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.000
“Hideki”...

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:19.220
Is it Hideki?

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:21.760
I don't know who it is, it's probably a friend

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:23.720
“Ah, it's a friend” Yes, yes, yes
*GF2: Ah~ It's a friend*

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.080
“You can say that”
*BF: You can say that*

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.180
“You're finally calling me by my first name? My sweet…”
"Hideki: You're finally calling me by my first name? My sweet..."

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:30.040
What do you mean?

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:32.220
Eh?

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.900
*Excuse Failed*

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:35.740
What is this?!

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.460
That would never happen!

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.780
Eeeeeh?

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.700
"Aah, I'm sorry! It wasn't with you!"

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:42.860
*GF2: ... Then, with whom did you go?*

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:43.780
"Michiko" 
(Female name)

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.800
Mama!

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:46.400
*GF2: Who is Michiko?!*

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:47.600
Ah, yes, yes, yes, that's right…
*BF: But that is my mother's name on the family register*

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:48.880
*GF2: You call her by her name...*

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:49.540
*BF: It's Michiko*

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:50.560
*GF2: I'm sorry, that's very unnatural....*

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:51.260
“That’s very...” Ah...

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.120
He got turned down

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.940
I see

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:55.460
It’s true, that sometimes does happen

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.480
*GF2: This is the first time you've come here, right...?*

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:58.700
"No, you came with me"!

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:00.380
We went together, we went together

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:01.440
"We never went"
*GF2: What are you talking about? We never went*

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.400
"Eh...? You don’t remember? You were on a date with me..."

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:08.760
*GF2: I don’t remember at all, but I’m sure I never came to this shop*

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:09.300
Aaaahh...

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.120
*BF: I don’t want to doubt you, but you know... *

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:11.980
Eh?! Isn’t this guy the worst?
*BF: Maybe it’s that you are dating another man and you forget what you do with me?*

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:13.560
*GF2: Why are you trying to pretend like you don’t know anything?*

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.460
Of course not, you’re lost, you’re out

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:17.860
"You’re right, it’s the first time I come here"

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.720
*GF2: But you said their pasta was delicious*

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.160
Eeehh...

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:25.180
*I meant that I heard that their fresh pasta was delicious, come on, let's go*

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:26.580
"I meant that their fresh pasta was..."
*I meant that I heard that their fresh pasta was delicious, come on, let's go*

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:27.300
*I meant that I heard that their fresh pasta was delicious, come on, let's go*

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.140
Ah, it’s true, I think I’ll choose this option

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:32.020
"I was meaning that the food of this place must be delicious"

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:33.320
"Come, let’s enter!", or something like that

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.940
Aaahh...

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:39.920
*GF: BF? What are you doing?*

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:40.620
Eh...

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:42.380
WHY?!

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.800
I don’t understand what’s happening!

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:48.260
How can the world be so small?

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:49.700
What?

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.100
Maybe they’re close to the university...?

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.600
Eh?

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:57.420
Maybe he’s going out with a girl from a club from the university?

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.360
Did he know this girl close to the university?

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.580
"Aaah, I’m sorry! I didn’t come with you"

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.600
"Point to an empty space"

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:09.520
*GF2: Eh? There’s something there?*

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:11.580
"It was with you all day"
*BF: It was with you all day*

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:13.360
"Eh?"
*GF2: Eh? There’s no one here, you’re scaring me, stop it!*

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:17.620
"The ghost thing was a lie ♥"

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:18.840
*BF: The ghost thing was a lie ♥*

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.020
*GF2: Ah? What are you playing at? That’s enough, I’m going home*

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:21.360
It’s true, I understand you...

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.340
Let’s return to the last question...

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:25.320
I’ll use the “I” points!
(Points that allow you to go back to the last decision)

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.440
*GF2: Eh? There’s no one here, you’re scaring me, stop it!*

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:29.440
"Pretend that you’re being possessed"

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:31.100
"Uguu..."
*BF: Uguu... it hurts... Aaahhhaahh!*

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.400
Ah, she’s worried
*GF2: Eh? Hey, are you okay!?*

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:35.520
"My granddaughter..."

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:37.280
*BF: My granddaughter... *

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.840
Eh?
*GF2: Eh...? *

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:40.720
*BF: I borrowed this lad’s body to meet you*

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.700
Though I still think her grandmother (grandfather) is still alive

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.400
*GF2: My grandfather is still alive, damn liar!*

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:46.460
I guessed it...

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:47.500
I understand...

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:52.580
*GF2: Eh? Hey, are you okay!?*

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:53.500
"Uh... ho...?"

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:54.460
Uhoho?

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:55.120
Uho?
*GF2: ...?*

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:56.120
"U... ho? Hoho, ho... "
*BF: U... ho? Hoho, ho... Uhooo! Woman! Woman! Woman!*

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:57.060
"Woman! Woman!"

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:57.920
*GF2: Nooooo! Don’t get any closer!! You're impossible, impossible, impossible!!*

00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:59.460
I’m finished...

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:00.960
I’m finished completely...

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:02.960
Eh? It’s very hard!

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:03.940
*GF2: This is the first time you've come here, right...?*

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:05.060
"No, you came with me*

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:07.960
"We never went"
*GF2: What are you talking about? We never went*

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:09.280
"We went!!!"

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:12.760
"We didn’t come!"
*GF2: We didn’t come!!!*

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:15.720
Ah, aaaah, a natural response!

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.740
"Ah, now that you say it, it’s true, we didn’t come"

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:20.300
* Novio: Ah, now that you say it, it’s true, we didn’t come*

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:21.740
*GF2: Don’t lie, maybe you’re confusing me with another person?*

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:22.500
Eeehh?

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:26.660
"We didn’t come!!!!"

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:28.360
*BF: We didn’t come!!!!*

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:29.080
*GF2: But you just said we did come!*

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.660
*BF: We went!!!!*

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:31.060
*GF2: I can’t go out with someone who’s messed up in the head*

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:33.280
*You can use an “I” point to return to the last decision*

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.240
But for the message to appear now, means…

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:38.600
That I can clear the stage if I return to the last decision?

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:40.920
*GF2: Don’t lie, maybe you’re confusing me with another person?*

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:42.880
"Aaahh, I’m sorry! I didn’t come with you"

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:44.420
*BF: Aaahh, I’m sorry! I didn’t come with you*

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:45.580
"Then, with whom did you go?"
*GF2: ... Then, with whom did you go?*

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:46.820
Well...

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.580
Is it Hi...Hi...Hideki?

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:49.580
Aaaaahhh...

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:52.000
*inhales*

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.620
MAN, YOU HAVE NO REASON TO APPEAR!

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:55.340
Where do you suppose he came from?!

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:57.140
"No, you came with me"

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:58.040
You came, you came

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:59.960
*GF2: What are you talking about? We never went*

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:01.760
I told you we went!

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:03.740
*GF2: We didn’t come!!!*

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:04.760
"I’m saying we went!!!!"

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:05.900
*BF: I’m saying we went!!!!*

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:06.880
"Eeehh...?"
*BF2: Eeehh...? *

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:08.360
*BF: I’m sorry, I dreamt that we went together and that’s why I said we went...*

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:09.780
Ah...
*GF2: Really? Man, you’re adorable ♥*

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:10.600
Man...

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:14.480
I chose all the options and it was this, really… *murmuring*

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:18.200
"Shampoo"
*8th Stage: Shampoo*

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:20.480
Shampoo...

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:21.480
Ah, they’re fighting!

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:24.300
"That’s enough, you’ll make me angry!", you already look angry...
*BF: That’s enough, you’ll make me angry!*

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:25.760
Both are already angry
*GF: I’ll also get angry!*

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:27.220
*BF: I love you more!*

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:28.180
Haahhh!

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:29.900
It appeared...

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:31.140
What is that?

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:32.440
It’s like it was important

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:34.220
*GF: Oh man, I love you more!*

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:34.860
Who loves more...?

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:36.380
AAAHH, HOW DISGUSTING!
*BF: Aahh, in that case, we’ll leave it in a draw, yes? ♥*

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:37.120
*GF: Yes ♥ I’ll go heat the water to take a bath*

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:37.720
*BF: Will we bathe together? ♥*

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:38.480
*GF: I told you we can’t ♥*

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:42.020
It looks like she saw something...

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:43.940
Mmm?

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:45.920
Aaaahhh...
*Soft set for long hair*

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:48.040
Your face scares me...

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:50.140
"Hey, hey, BF"
*GF: Hey, hey, BF*

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:53.580
"Fight"!

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:55.940
"What is this?"
*GF: What is this?*

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:00.540
To tell you the truth...

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:03.200
Thanks to that, my hair is soft and silky

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:05.420
*GF: Eeehh? Is your hair that long?*

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:06.400
"Eh, is your hair...?"

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:08.280
Aaaah! There’s also a hair?

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:12.940
"That’s not hair"

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:14.860
*GF: Eh...?

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:18.340
Is it this option?

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:20.500
"Do you know what Takarage is?"

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:25.900
"It's a single long white hair that grows out of some part of your body"

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:27.580
"It's probably one of those"

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:29.600
Maybe she’ll say it’s not colored white?

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:34.220
"It’s a strand that doesn’t come from my head"

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:34.880
"Do you want to see?"

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:36.920
*GF: You’re not human! Goodbye*

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:37.860
What just happened?

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:41.040
But I thought I was doing well...

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:42.560
*GF: What is this?*

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:45.180
"Thanks to that, my hair is smooth and silky"

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:47.420
*GF: Eeehh? Is your hair that long?*

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:48.860
Well...

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:53.620
"That’s not hair"

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:55.320
"Eh...?"
*GF: Eh...?

00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:58.080
I’ll choose this option!

00:06:58.420 --> 00:06:59.280
*BF: Do you know what’s "Takarage”?*

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:00.060
"Sometimes it grows long white hair in some parts of your body"

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:00.680
"It probably has something to do with that"

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:01.820
*GF: No, but it’s colored black*

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:02.660
I was right!

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:03.780
It’s black, right?

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:04.940
I understand!

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:06.060
"Fight"!

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:08.680
*GF: What is this?*

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:11.060
"Aaahh... Someone left it there"

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:12.380
*GF: Eeehh...? Does that person have long hair?*

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:13.120
"Long"

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:14.920
Ah, the hair came up again...

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:17.040
*GF: Eeehh...? Does that person have long hair?*

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:19.500
"It must have been my younger sister"

00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:21.260
What about this?

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:22.700
Ouch...

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:23.860
*GF: She has short hair!*

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:25.780
Where did she get that photograph?

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:28.720
She went and searched in the whole house!

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:31.860
That hair is really annoying, isn’t it?

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:33.440
"It’s best not to ask any more about that"

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:34.940
*GF: Is that because you feel guilty about something?*

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:35.960
It’s not because of that!
*GF: Is that because you feel guilty about something?*

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:37.860
"Well..."

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:38.360
Ah, but...

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:40.040
"Well... maybe I feel guilty"

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:42.500
"... What are you hiding?"
*GF: ...What are you hiding?*

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:46.940
*To tell you the truth, lately my hair has been falling out, so I bought a good woman’s product for the skin*

00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:47.840
I’ll choose this option

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:49.780
"To tell you the truth, lately my hair has been falling out..."

00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:52.880
Ah, but if I choose this option, she’ll probably show the hair, right?

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:56.240
"I found that shampoo over there"

00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:58.180
*GF: Do you use something you picked up there?*

00:07:58.180 --> 00:07:59.900
Well… I’m sorry

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:01.200
"What is this?"

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:04.300
"Thanks to that, my hair is..."

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:05.960
Ah, it’s not this option, wait, wait...

00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:07.640
This isn’t it

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:09.360
Ah, but there’s still other options
*GF: Eeehh? Is your hair this long?*

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:12.800
"Ah, that's from when I had long hair"

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:17.580
*GF: Eehh! You had long hair?*

00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:20.500
Is it this option?

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:25.640
If I say something specific like "It was 2 years ago", I’m sure she’ll show me a photograph

00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:28.020
*It was during the time I was a vocalist in a band, even though we broke up pretty soon*

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:30.160
*GF: Eh? Sing, sing!*

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:31.000
*BF: ♪ Boeeeee... *

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.080
*GF: I’m sorry, I think we should also break up... *

00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:32.660
Aaahh...

00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:35.420
Is it that important to be able to sing?

00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:36.580
*GF: What is this?*

00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:38.980
Eeeh? I wonder what is it...

00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:43.060
"Aaahh... Someone left it there"

00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:44.440
*GF: Eeehh...? Does that person have long hair?*

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:48.800
"It’s my mothers’"

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:52.600
Why?

00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:55.260
"She has short curly hair!"
*GF: She has short curly hair!*

00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:59.220
Even if it's short curly hair, stretching it will make it longer right?

00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:04.020
A woman's heart is so annoyiiiiiiiing!

00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:04.860
"What is this?"

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:08.440
"It’s best not to ask any more about that"

00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:09.580
Now I only have....

00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:12.600
1 HP...
*GF: Is that because you feel guilty about something?*

00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:15.540
"It’s not that"

00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:17.000
Mmm... but...

00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:18.440
Mmm...

00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:19.540
"It’s not that"!

00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:22.440
"In that case, answer me, what is this?"
*GF: In that case, answer me, what is this?*

00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:24.060
"It’s best not to ask anymore about that"

00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:25.840
Since otherwise, I’ll have no HP...

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:26.980
*GF: Is that because you feel guilty about something?*

00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:28.880
Is it "Well... maybe I feel guilty"?

00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:31.540
I’m tired now
*GF: … What are you hiding?*

00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:34.880
"To tell you the truth, lately my hair has been falling out..."

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:37.900
But the hair is coming up

00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:39.180
Eh?
*GF: Ah… it’s true, that doesn’t sound good... I’m sorry, alright?*

00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:40.080
Ah, ah, I did it!
*BF: Eh...?

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:40.780
Eh?

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:42.600
Ah, it looks like I did it!

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:44.220
Eh? The hair didn’t come up

00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:45.820
I see

00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:47.180
*9th Stage: Deceit*

00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:47.980
"Deceit"

00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:51.020
I’m already done for

00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:56.800
If you're going to trick her for that, you'd better cut the relationship, right?

00:09:56.900 --> 00:09:59.760
*BF: You’re 100 times more adorable than that actress ♥*

00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:00.900
“You’re 100 times more adorable”

00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:03.040
“Than that actress ♥”

00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:04.580
That’s impossible

00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:07.860
GF: "Should I become an actress?"

00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:08.960
“You can't”

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:11.300
*BF: You can't ♥ After all, I'm the only one allowed to kiss you ♥*

00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:12.440
Aaah, you know...

00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:16.860
Not all actresses kiss in their shows...

00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:18.760
That's creepy, really…
*GF: Oh, BF... ♥ 
BF: I’ll go shower ♥*

00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:19.520
Really...

00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:21.280
Ah...

00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:23.700
Your phone is ringing

00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:25.700
*GFF: I love you too ♥*

00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:27.060
"I..."
*GF: .....*

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:28.260
*BF: I forgot my pho-... I meant I forgot to give you a kiss*

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:29.300
HER FACE!
*BF: I forgot my pho-... I meant I forgot to give you a kiss*

00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:31.440
*GF: ...I need you to explain to me about something*

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:32.880
I wonder what happened...

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:38.360
"What does this message mean?"
*GF: What does this message mean?*

00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:40.580
Uh...

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:46.060
“Hmm? Probably sent to the wrong person”

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:48.300
*GF: Why does my friend have your LIME?*

00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:50.880
"Why does my friend have your LIME?"

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:55.820
*BF: I can't tell you that. Please, believe in me*

00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:57.360
Please!

00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:58.180
*GF: Why can't you tell me…? Are you cheating?*

00:10:58.200 --> 00:10:58.980
I'm not cheating!
*GF: Why can't you tell me…? Are you cheating?*

00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:03.760
"Mmm... Do I not have any choice than to tell you...?"

00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:05.600
*GF: Tell me immediately*

00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:06.700
I’m sorry

00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:08.940
*BF: It was supposed to be a surprise, but I have a gift for you*

00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:11.140
Eeeh...

00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:12.540
Is it in the house?

00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:14.000
I’m sure there’s a lot of stuff in the place
*(I’m sure I left it in this place)*

00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:23.200
"Another message of my friend arrived, saying: 'Let’s go out and have fun again ♥'"

00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:24.960
Ah, I’m done for, right?

00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:31.120
"I’m sure I left it in the wallet"

00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:33.840
Oh!

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:35.380
Good!

00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:36.700
*I consulted with your friend and she helped me choose it*

00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:37.460
Oooh!
*I consulted with your friend and she helped me choose it*

00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:38.540
*GF: That makes me happy, BF… Thank you ♥*

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:39.620
It’s a piece of cake

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:42.100
Eh? Ah? Ah...
*GF: Did you just do a victory pose?*

00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:42.980
Well...

00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:44.440
...I did nothing

00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:46.420
*GF: That doesn’t solve what the message said*

00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:47.320
Ah

00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:48.920
Fight!

00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:50.360
*GF: Let me see your LIME*

00:11:50.740 --> 00:11:53.760
"It seems this’ll take us some time, I’ll go get something to drink”

00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:55.420
*GF: ...*

00:11:59.100 --> 00:11:59.600
Oh!

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:01.540
Eh? Which is it?

00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:02.640
This?

00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:06.900
"Please don’t do this at home"
*BF: Good, I’ll place the phone in the microwave to break it*

00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:08.000
"Good"

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:10.920
"I’ll place the phone in the microwave to break it"

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.700
Normally, doing something like that is dangerous!

00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:18.680
He died!

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:21.840
It ended in many ways...

00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:23.340
Completely blank

00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:31.060
I’ll return to the last choice!

00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:35.260
*GF: Let me see your LIME*

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:36.060
Well...

00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:38.620
"I’m sorry, I should go to the bathroom", can’t I throw the phone into the toilet?

00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:40.800
*BF: I’m sorry, I should go to the bathroom*

00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:42.680
Well, I’m in a hurry, I need to go to the bathroom

00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:43.200
*GF: Leave the cellphone here*

00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:44.260
Aaahhh...

00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:45.600
"Run away with the cellphone"

00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:48.200
*BF: Noo!!*

00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:52.440
*Go to GFF’s house*

00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:54.940
Oh, is it this option?

00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:56.860
G-GFF, that’s her name?
*BF: GFF!!*

00:12:57.640 --> 00:12:59.320
"My GF found out everything"
*BF: My GF found out everything*

00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:01.860
"That woman really seems like a devil!"
*BF: That woman really seems like a devil!*

00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:03.620
*Can you help me hide for a while!?*

00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:05.140
"Can you...?"

00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:07.300
Is it "Can you"?

00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:09.040
"Can you help me hide for a while!?"

00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:11.720
"You’re the only person that can help me..."
*BF: You’re the only person that can help me... *

00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:15.300
*GFF: Eh, BF? Who are you talking to?*

00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:16.460
Aaaah...

00:13:16.580 --> 00:13:17.820
Aaaaahhh...

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:18.900
*BF: Eh?*

00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:21.720
Eh...

00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:23.160
Eeh...

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:26.080
...Can something like that happen?

00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:26.920
Good!

00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:28.060
In that case...

00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:29.360
Ai-chan is...

00:13:29.420 --> 00:13:30.140
You know...

00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:31.400
Pure...

00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:32.920
A good girl...

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:35.360
And surely not annoying at all, so then...

00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:38.960
I can’t understand an annoying woman’s heart!

00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:42.160
And I also can’t understand the feelings of someone who deceives!

00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:45.100
I don’t understand this game!

00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:46.140
Having said that...

00:13:46.140 --> 00:13:49.240
Be sure to work hard in your love relationships

00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:49.920
Good!

00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:52.400
This was Virtual YouTuber, Kizuna Ai!

00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:53.220
See you later!

00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:54.620
Ah, how annoying it is!
