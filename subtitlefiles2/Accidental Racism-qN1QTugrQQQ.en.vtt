00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:09.880
Hi! You mind if I eat here with you?

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:10.460
Of course! (He should've said, "No, I don't mind!)

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:11.000
Ok.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.020
So weird being the new kid... Hehe.

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:14.520
I'm Madison.

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:15.320
Oh. I'm, uh, Casey.

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:16.460
Hi, I'm Ken.

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:18.820
So...where are you from, Ken? (SPOILER ALERT she's gonna regret that question soon)

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:22.480
Um...from San Francisco. I was at the branch for a little bit just transferred now.

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.820
Where are you FROM from though? (what's that supposed to mean? huh?)

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:26.500
(the look of disapproval)

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.680
Um...if you're asking me where my family's from. Uh...China, I guess.

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:32.380
Cool. You're Chinese.

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:32.900
American. (stop talking, Madison!)

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:34.440
Mm! Right.

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.200
Chinese American. (ABC's unite! American-born Chinese)

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:37.500
That's awesome.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.940
You know I'm from the Midwest and um...we're not the most culturally diverse part of the country, you know.

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:42.440
(stop talking, Madison!!!)

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.140
Oh. I forgot my coffee at my desk. I'll be right back.

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:48.580
(let the ranting begin!)

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:49.080
(why is there a bell ringing)

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.400
Can you believe this girl?

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:52.240
What?

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:56.120
Where're you FROM from? Ooh, you're Chinese.

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:57.020
So ignorant.

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.780
I mean, she honestly might not know much about your culture.

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:00.780
It's true what she said.

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.900
The...the Midwest isn't very diverse.

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.160
I mean, trust me. I'm from Kentucky.

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:05.900
(SPOILER ALERT Casey will regret saying that)

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.460
Oh, no way! That's cool!

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.620
I don't think I've ever met anyone from Kentucky before.

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:10.380
What are you guys called?

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.160
Like Kentuckers, Kentuckets?

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.400
I think the proper term is Kentuckian.

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.980
Oh.

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:16.440
You live there your whole life?

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:17.340
Born and raised.

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.960
That's crazy! You have no accent.

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.440
Well, uh, I just didn't pick one up.

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.100
Howr dem grits, son?

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.200
What was that? (realizing his mistake of telling Ken he's from Kentucky)

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.180
Kentucky's part of the South, right?

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:27.960
That's my... that's my Southern accent.

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.200
Well, not all of us speak like that. You understand

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.920
Oh my gosh!

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:31.540
Ok...

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:33.040
Look what I'm having for lunch.

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.120
Kentucky Fried Chicken. What a coincidence, huh?

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.460
I bet you love this, huh?

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:37.340
Here have some!

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.240
I...I actually don't eat it that often.

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:39.740
(look and sound of realization)

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:40.460
You know what? I just remembered.

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:43.020
My roommate in college was actually from Kentucky.

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.540
His name was Corey. Do you know Corey?

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.760
You want to know if I know Corey because we're both from Kentucky?

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:48.360
Uh huh.

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.480
No, I don't know Corey. (stop talking, Ken!)

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.420
Have you ever been to the Kentucky Derby?

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:52.880
I've never been to the Kentucky Derby.

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:53.780
But it's in Kentucky.

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:54.340
Yes.

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:55.160
So why don't you go?

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:56.860
That's true. (regretting not going to the Kentucky Derby)

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:57.800
So, I was thinking.

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.920
Ken, you must've been born here because you don't have any accent at all.

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.720
OK, Madison!

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.180
Just because I'm Chinese doesn't mean I have a Chinese accent

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:08.740
by default, ok?

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:12.180
It doesn't mean that I eat orange chicken and fortune cookies all the time.

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.260
It doesn't that I know all your Asian friends.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.240
It doesn't mean I hang out in Chinatown

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.980
every night.

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:18.860
Why don't you go educate yourself, ok?

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.000
Don't be so ignorant!

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:21.580
Geez!

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:25.560
Oh my...

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:26.220
Yeah.

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.460
I didn't mean for my questions to be offensive.

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:30.020
I...

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.380
I was just genuinely curious.

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.040
I just think that we can all be more culturally aware

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.060
in the situation.

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:39.480
Just be more...

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:40.600
sensitive towards others.

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:41.320
Right.

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.040
You know I...

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.300
actually do really miss this stuff.

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:49.920
Do you want some fried chi-

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.220
(regrets what he was about to say)

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.160
I'm going to throw it away.

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.900
Hey everyone!

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:56.840
I hope you like that sketch.

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:59.020
It was actually based on a true story.

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:07.340
I, um, met a guy named Casey on set once and he was from Kentucky and I was asking him all these questions about where he was from and I caught myself in the middle of it thinking,

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:12.520
"Man, if someone was asking me these questions about being Chinese I would probably be pretty offended."

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:16.180
Um, but he took it cool, uh, so thanks and sorry Casey. (it should be he took it WELL)

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.220
I was genuinely, you know, just really interested about Kentucky.

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.720
Anyways!

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:20.500
If you haven't heard yet.

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.140
Wong Fu Productions is making a movie!

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.840
Yep!

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.560
We are nearing the end of our fundraising campaign and the support has been so incredible so far.

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:35.020
Um, it's, uh it's amazing to see everyone contributing and donating, um, just because they believe in us, so thank you so much to everyone that's already contributed.

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.160
We can't wait to start making this movie in just a couple of months.

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:42.460
Um, so if you haven't yet, check out the link below, um, for all the information.

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:44.700
There's been a lot of updates and progress on the project and

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.340
we've put in new perks as well.

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:51.180
So you have a bout a week left to, uh, get in on this, so don't delay.

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:56.140
Check out the website and, um, one more week! Thanks guys! See ya!
