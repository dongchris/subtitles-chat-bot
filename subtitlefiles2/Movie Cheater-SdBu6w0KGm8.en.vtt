00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:16.280
You want some?

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:17.880
Uh, you know, I'm gonna get my own.

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:19.280
Your own?

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:20.340
It's natural water like we always do...(heartbroken ;m;)

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.160
I don't think it's going to be enough.

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:23.820
Be right back.

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:26.040
(Shrugs)

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:28.500
(Phone vibrates)

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.780
Hey, baby, movie's about to start, what's up?

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:34.220
Is Chris with you?

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.200
Yep. Well no, not at the moment he's uh getting more popcorn. Dumbass is totally going to miss the trailers.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:42.060
Don't you think it's weird that Chris always leaves right before the trailer?

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:43.580
So? He just likes popcorn.

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:44.700
Yeah, but it's like clockwork.

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.260
So what are you trying to say?

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.580
I think Chris is a movie cheater.

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:52.100
What? (sputters) No- No, what? What are you talk- what?

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:55.760
Chris would never do that to me. I mean, do you realize how ridiculous that sounds?

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.360
Okay, I'm sorry I even brought it up. I love you. Kay?

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:01.380
Love you.

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.800
What are you doing?

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.520
Yo, dude, where were you? I thought you were gonna miss the trailers.

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.000
Dude, I never miss the trailers with you.

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:14.440
Got you this.

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:15.740
Sweet, thanks.

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:20.520
(Laughter)

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:26.380
(More laughter)

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.680
Hey, um... I'm gonna get a drink. You want anything?

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.220
I already got you one.

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:33.560
Oh.

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.440
You know, I kinda feel like a Dr. Pepper.

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.940
I'll go with you.

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:39.440
No, no! No, Phil, you can't.

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.420
You have you to stay and tell me what I miss.

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.060
I'll be right back.

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.000
(mouths) What?

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.220
Hey honey. You're right.

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.200
I knew it! Honey, you're in denial. He's obviously still watching films with Manny.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.380
But he told me he would stop a long time ago.

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.980
Oh my God. That's what they all [say]

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:10.260
You need to respect yourself and confront him or you're sleeping on the couch tonight. I love you. Okay. I'll see you at home?

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:11.140
Don't forget the milk.

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:12.140
Shh!

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:13.320
You shush!

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:15.160
Sorry.

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.960
What took you so long?

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.980
They ran out of popcorn, so (shrugs).

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.960
They ran out of popcorn? At a movie theatre?

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:25.020
It happens.

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.080
Hey, I got you this, though.

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.660
Bro is this a sprite?

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:30.220
Yep.

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.480
You're the best.

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.640
I have to go to the restroom. I'll be right back.

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.200
No. N- Wha? Smallest bladder...

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:44.580
(Laughter)

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.580
(laughing) I almost missed it.

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:49.620
Chris, what are you doing here?

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.160
Phil, what? What are you doing out here?

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:52.180
I'm looking for you.

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:53.460
Why'd you just come out of that theater?

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.460
Uh... I got turned around.

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:56.640
Where's the Sprite that I just got you?

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.060
I actually drank it, but hey, listen. We're gonna miss the movie. Let's go!

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.060
Are you still watching movies with Manny?

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.600
(Stammers)

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.600
But why why why are you acting like this?

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.260
Just answer the question.

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:09.380
Chris?

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:12.140
You...!

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:13.200
Phil, I can explain.

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.880
Yeah, please explain Chris. I would love to hear this too.

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:20.180
You told me that you would stop watching movies with...that, a long time ago.

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:26.400
Whoa, bro, I don't know who think you are, but Chris and I have been watching movies together since elementary school.

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:28.460
Is that the Sprite that I just bought you?

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.220
Did you two share this drink?

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:35.340
(hurls)

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.500
How could you do this? We made a promise!

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:44.420
Every week, I would get an extra large popcorn and a drink. I even save a seat for you.

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:46.609
Just a little left of center just how you like it.

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:50.480
He likes it to the right of center. Shows how much you know.

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.580
Dude you want to take [it] to the condiment section?

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:53.240
Oh, you do not want to step up.

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:54.820
Oh, I wanna to step up to the streets.

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:55.980
I wanna Step Up 3D!

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:56.840
I wanna Step Up 3D IMAX!

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:58.460
I wanna Step Up Revolution!

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.700
I wanna- There will be more!

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:04.700
Stop! Guys, stop! Listen. I'm sorry that I lied to both of you, okay?

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:05.200
(dramatic music)

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:08.340
Manny, listen, I know we made a promise dude, but

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:13.820
We were so young, you know? As I grew up. I realized I like movies other than big-budget Sci-Fi.

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:20.120
After a while, it felt like an obligation with you. It was the same routine, the same snacks. I felt trapped.

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:24.260
Phil, it was eye-opening watching artsy movies with you.

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.680
but, I still and will always love Michael Bay movies.

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.260
I felt like you would judge me so I lied about it

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.080
Michael Bay??

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.660
Look, maybe I wanted to get caught

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:39.580
It was kind of dumb watching movies with you guys at the exact same time all these years.

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:41.420
Yeah, yeah, that was pretty dumb.

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:42.260
Yeah, it was pretty stupid.

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:45.020
But I'm glad I came clean about it

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:49.750
So what now?

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:54.660
Maybe the three of us can watch your movie together

00:04:58.940 --> 00:04:59.480
(slap)

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:02.200
(slap)

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:04.320
Movie whore!

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:07.740
(Laughing)

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:08.740
Aliza?!

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:11.220
Porter...

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:13.980
I thought you [said] you weren't having coffee with Christine anymore.

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:21.660
Step up to the streets. I want to step up evolution. I want to step up every three
