00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:13.900
I'll talk to you later.

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:29.300
Carly.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.500
Carly.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.060
Keep it together.

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:40.500
You can do this.

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:43.900
Stay with me Carly.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:46.420
Carly.

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.800
(cries)

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:08.700
Carly.

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:12.800
Carly, are you there?

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:21.600
You're here now.

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:24.700
There's no avoiding it.

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.760
Where?

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:28.400
First Step:

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.000
Reminiscing and Retracting

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:35.640
I don't wanna get up...

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:37.500
That's fine.

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:39.660
You can lay here all day.

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:42.960
You can cry all night.

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.100
You're allowed to do all the things
you promised yourself you'd never do.

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.100
Like listening to an old voicemail
just to hear his voice.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:51.400
(Sorry I missed your call...)

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.700
(I'm on a subway right now
but I'll call you back later, okay?)

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.760
Or, wish he'd message you just so
you'd know he was thinking of you too.

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.320
But at the same time wish he wouldn't because
it would only make you miss him more.

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.040
And you know you shouldn't but...

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:08.180
...you text him.

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.260
Maybe even call him...

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:11.800
You fight it...

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.400
...but you lose.

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.400
You watch the sappy rom coms

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.500
It's cliché but... go ahead.
Eat from the carton.

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.380
I miss everything about him.

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:30.600
What do you miss?

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.180
How sturdy he felt when I hugged him tight

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.000
The way he would

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.780
rest his chin on the top of my head

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:46.000
How reassuring his hand felt
as he kettled me through a crowd

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:52.100
That look in his eye when
he 'accidentally' ate the last cookie

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:57.800
Sweaty kisses after he worked out 
which made me cringe at the time but..

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.000
..now it just makes me smile.

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:03.820
I miss it all

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:06.500
That's okay.

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.120
You're allowed to.

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:11.320
You're supposed to.

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.500
It's okay to look like crap and not care.

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.000
Who are you trying to impress anyway?

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.000
You see him?

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:24.800
Everywhere...

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.600
Hey it's okay to purposely avoid
all those places and things.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.500
You just wanna be alone.

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.100
Your friends insist on taking you out
but all you want is..

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.200
..to shut off all the lights,

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.060
curl up in bed and..

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:50.800
..cry some more

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:53.700
Your friends try to help by saying,

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.400
You can do so much better!

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.700
I didn't like him anyways.

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:00.520
I don't want to hear any of that

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:03.700
It doesn't help at all

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000
I just... want him back in my life

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:12.260
Or do you just miss the thought of him?

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.500
You miss the routine,
the comfort, the body

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.700
That's all, right?

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:23.780
No

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
At this point you just miss him

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.000
And that's okay.

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:34.500
Carly

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:37.320
Carly, you there?

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:39.500
Yeah

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.280
Do you want to get up?

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:51.000
Actually... I do

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:58.320
(sighs)

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:59.880
How long was I there?

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:02.200
It doesn't matter.

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:05.380
All that matters is that you're ready.

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:07.160
For the next step?

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.000
Release

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:13.380
I'm hungry

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:17.000
I think you can put some effort
into looking sorta decent.

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:19.080
What does that entail?

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:20.700
Brushing your hair?

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:22.700
Maybe a little eye shadow...

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:24.100
Some blush?

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.500
Yeah, no. You’re right, no blush yet.

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:31.020
Call up one or two of 
your closest friends to catch up.

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:33.740
You’re ready to talk
a little bit about your ex

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:35.500
But this time with a clear head

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:39.220
You might see cute guys with your eyes but

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:41.180
nothing stirs inside your heart

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:45.400
No butterflies, no sparks, no interest

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:48.640
Because I still miss him.

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:50.420
You will for a while

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:55.100
But at least the urges to contact him
or check up become less frequent

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:58.500
You just have to learn
to suppress those urges now

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:03.280
How long will I be here?

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:06.080
As long as you need to be.

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:19.660
You're up early!

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:20.840
I'm ready!

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:21.840
The next step:

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:23.420
Rebuilding

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:25.940
One day becomes two

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:27.400
Two becomes a week

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:31.080
Weeks become months and soon
you're ready to prove to yourself

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:32.220
That you can live on

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:34.380
You actually want to go out

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:36.580
Socialize, meet new people

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:39.900
You talk, laugh, flirt

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:42.320
Yes, even flirt or..

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:44.320
whatever you call what you just did

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.440
I'm a little rusty...

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:48.560
It's okay, it's been a while

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:50.520
As long as you're smiling again

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.940
You start doing things towards
the better version of you.

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:56.080
Trying a fruit cleanse

00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:58.200
Finally taking that trip to Europe

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:00.660
Trying yoga for the first time

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:04.540
Cutting your hair, oh!
Okay, nothing too crazy

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:06.500
Running a marathon

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:07.940
Checking out a museum

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:10.000
Cleaning out your old clothes

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:12.720
You start to see life without him

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:21.140
Carly

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:25.520
It's the first time he came over

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:29.220
I cooked spaghetti and 
he got a stain on it

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:34.760
I put in the wash right away

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.920
We ended up talking for hours

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:39.440
And then he forgot it here

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:43.800
You've made so much progress,
Carly, please...

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:47.300
I kept it in my closet
as a reminder of that night

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:51.320
That was almost 4 years ago

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:55.880
I thought he was the one

00:07:58.200 --> 00:07:59.220
We both did.

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:02.920
Yea... it did feel special.

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:05.920
It was

00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:09.860
And it always will be

00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:16.380
Sometimes, no matter how hard you try

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:19.320
Something can always hold you back from moving on

00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:23.420
A lingering memory of false hope

00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:25.880
And you fall back a few steps.

00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:28.100
But if you can be strong

00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:30.660
you'll finally make it out.

00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:38.020
Renewed

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:43.920
The world is brighter, happier, lighter

00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:47.660
That huge weight of pain and fear 
has been lifted and

00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:49.100
All you feel is excitement

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:51.460
Excitement for what's to come

00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:53.780
Excitement for the possibilities.

00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:58.060
At this point it's not even about
finding another person to love

00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:03.000
It's about find who you are
as a person, as a human.

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:06.280
It’s only when you don’t 
have to consider anyone else

00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:08.640
That you can focus completely on your life

00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:12.380
In creating the best
possible version of yourself.

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:22.680
But there's no harm in smiling back
at that cute guy in the coffee shop.
