00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:02.160
Hi everyone!

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:04.300
Virtual Youtuber,
Kizuna Ai here!

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:05.260
It's a bit sudden but,

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:06.160
I...

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:07.720
want to be merchandises!

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.740
I want to make Ai-chan goods!

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:10.660
Aren't famous people

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:13.100
have their own goods?

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:15.200
As means of income.. too.

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.480
I don't know when the day will come but

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:19.740
I'll try doing lots of things from now!

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.300
What kinds of goods would be nice...

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.360
is what I've been trying to think but..

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:24.600
but really

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:28.640
Something that would show my best appeal 
would be a good option, right?

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:30.260
Why would you ask?

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.260
It would feel like something special.

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:34.000
As you hold it on your hands..

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.080
I want you to feel deeply moved by it!

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:38.960
So...!

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:40.380
I've come with an idea!

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:41.160
Figure!

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:42.920
A smaller version of me

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.320
will go to each of your place!

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:46.760
Isn't this

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.160
also musubi?

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:49.300
[I meant "a sense of being connected"]

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:52.720
I went with the figure idea from the start, but

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:54.160
I..

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.500
I'm still a newbie and on a tight budget..

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
I don't have anything but this costume

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:01.640
That's why!

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.500
Posing is really important!

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.480
Clean pose?

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:06.660
Energetic pose?

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.760
or..

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.140
Sexy pose~

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.420
I think something like showing my body line

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.580
is related to my sexiness!

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:14.720
It's important, huh?

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:15.380
Sexiness.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.680
Let's posing!

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.660
Alright!

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.000
I tried to take some poses but

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.660
Did you have any favorites out of those?

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.560
But before I had a figurine..

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.500
I could get something like gravure job?

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.060
I..

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:12.320
I really mean it!

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.680
I wish for my figure release

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:16.420
if you support that notion I'll be happy!

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.740
I'll be in your care!

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.860
I wanna be goods,

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:21.440
I wanna be goods, I wanna be goods,

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:22.120
I wanna be goods, I wanna be goods, I wanna be goods,

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.760
I wanna be goods, I wanna be goods, I wanna be goods, I wanna be goods,

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:23.380
I wanna be goods, I wanna be goods, I wanna be goods, I wanna be goods, I wanna be goods,

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:24.040
I wanna be goods, I wanna be goods, I wanna be goods, I wanna be goods, I wanna be goods, I wanna be goods,

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.540
I wanna be goods,

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:25.040
I wanna be goods...
