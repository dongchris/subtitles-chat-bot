00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.900
Okay, okay, I got it. Don't worry.

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:08.900
Yes, I'll make sure they're not damaged.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.600
I'll call you if I have any questions, 
alright?

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.300
Alright, bye.

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:30.000
Scott?

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.100
Irene?

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:33.800
What are you doing here?

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:35.680
I thought this--

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:36.900
What are you doing here?

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.800
I live here.
[chuckles]

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.300
Oh... r-right.

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.560
I didn't know you were back in town.

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.760
Wait, uh, isn't your house on Maple
behind the old library?

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.800
Yeah, that was years ago. We moved.

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:53.500
I guess it's been a while, uh...

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:54.760
Anyways...

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:56.400
This is crazy, uh...

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.800
You wouldn't happen to be selling
some vinyl records, would you?

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:00.800
Yeah, I am! Oh--

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.960
Most of them are sold already, sorry.

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.500
Since when were you into vintage stuff?

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.420
I'm not. Um, my cousin is.

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:11.600
She saw your ad online and,

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.680
she got called into work so
she asked if I can pick them up for her.

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:16.000
Okay.

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:19.700
Well, come in. Come in!
[laughs]

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.980
You know, you haven't changed at all!
[giggles]

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.800
That look on your face
when I opened the door.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.140
What do you mean?

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.360
You were just as clueless back then, too.

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:36.820
I wasn't clueless.

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.200
Maybe nervous,

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.100
but only because your dad scared me.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.380
I think that was the point.

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:52.380
[Scott] How have you been?

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:54.260
Not bad!

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.300
Um, I started a new internship 
downtown so,

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.560
I'm staying here with my parents
'til I find my own place.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.200
That's exciting.

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:03.600
Thanks!

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.600
How are things at the shop?
You still work there?

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.760
Yeah I do. It's been busy.

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:10.780
But things have been well?

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:12.540
I'd say so.

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:16.600
You look great!

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:21.300
Uh...

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.700
Let me... find those records for you.
Sorry, this place is a mess!

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:29.100
Moving again?

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.780
[Irene] That? Oh no,
I'm just cleaning some stuff.

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.100
I'm having a garage sale next weekend.

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:36.400
You should come.

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.940
I mean, it's mostly old, useless junk.

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.600
But, maybe you'll find something you like.

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:29.820
You're really gonna make me guess?

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:30.740
Mm-hmm.

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:32.400
Fine.

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.000
It's... a new pair of shoes.

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:36.400
You wish!

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.900
It's... that antique typewriter
we saw last week.

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:41.100
Nope.

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:43.300
It's a puppy?

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:47.300
Wha-- Just open it!
[laughing]

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:52.600
Whoa.

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.900
I know you're gonna be busy with classes.

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.200
But if you can,

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:05.940
it works best if you go
somewhere far from the city lights.

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:10.200
That's where the skies are the clearest
and the stars are the brightest.

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.100
Somewhere like this?

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.600
Yeah, somewhere like this.

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:23.600
What's wrong?

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.880
We're supposed to go
stargazing together...

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:33.000
I know that's what we said but,

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.800
summer's already over and
you're leaving already, so...

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.000
I just thought--

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:42.080
I don't know...

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:47.500
Thank you.

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:49.620
I love it.

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.260
Scott... you really don't have to.

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:06.280
I mean- I don't even remember
when it stopped working.

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:09.320
Let me take a look at it, I wanna try.

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:11.380
I don't think it's totally hopeless.

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:16.900
Wait, Scott...

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:19.660
I don't want you to think that I--

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:21.800
I just...

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:25.100
I didn't know what to do with it. I mean--

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:27.040
It was so long ago, and I--

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:27.980
I know.

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:29.980
[quietly] I know.

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:32.800
It was nice seeing you again.

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:37.200
I'll let you know how this goes.

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:25.540
Things gonna be different.

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:30.160
In some things...

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:34.400
With us?

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:37.920
Not everything...

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:40.300
Not us.

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:51.200
Where do you think we'll end up?

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:54.200
I don't know.

00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:59.000
Somewhere like this.

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:25.920
[sigh]

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:54.500
[sigh]

00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:14.900
Is that everything?

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:16.800
I think so.

00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:20.000
You ready then?

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:23.200
Let's go.

00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:57.120
Before I forget.

00:08:57.800 --> 00:08:59.600
After I leave... okay?

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:03.000
Okay.

00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:07.400
