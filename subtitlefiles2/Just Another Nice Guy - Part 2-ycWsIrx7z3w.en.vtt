00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.460
I realized a mile is pretty far

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:24.620
and uh

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:25.440
it is dark.

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:27.680
Why didn't you go after me?

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:30.080
I thought you were a nice guy.

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:34.100
You seemed really upset

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:36.560
and I wanted to give you some space

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:40.500
and I was probably going to go find you after another minute,

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:42.960
and uh-

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.520
I don't want to be a "nice guy" anymore.

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:48.980
The truth is, Derek, I don't want you to change.

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:51.960
I like you just the way you are

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.800
emphasis on "I like you"

00:00:58.800 --> 00:00:59.960
What about everything else you said tonight?

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:03.380
Maybe I'm just afraid.

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.540
My last relationship was crap and

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.980
I'm afraid that if we date and it doesn't work out

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:14.060
then not only will we lose our friendship, but we'll hate each other, too.

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:16.500
I'd never want that.

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.560
Audrey

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:19.980
I'd never hate you

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:22.540
I'd only hate it if

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:24.000
you never gave

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:25.980
"us" a chance.

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:28.860
Then let's go for it.

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:38.340
F**K

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.200
ARE YOU SERIOUS??

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.640
"Nice guys finish last"

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.480
As a naive high schooler, I didn't want to believe it.

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.800
As a hopeful college student, I wanted to disprove it.

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:50.500
But here I was,

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.060
the morning after getting rejected by my dream girl and best friend, Audrey.

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.480
And all the evidence was right there in front of me;

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:58.800
despite avoiding the friendzone

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.520
and being upfront about my feelings

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.500
I was still turned down.

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:04.520
There was no hope for nice,

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:05.600
never has-

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.620
Are you in the middle of one of your internal monologues?

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.580
yes

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:12.060
thanks for interrupting.

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:13.200
Please finish.

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:16.320
never will.

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.900
what do you want?

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.280
I'm guessing last night didn't go well?

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.040
Well, let's just say that Audrey

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.400
chose walking a mile alone at night versus spending another five minutes with me.

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.880
What happened?

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:33.320
I messed up.

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.000
I thought she had feelings

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.660
but she didn't see me that way.

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:39.180
Sorry.

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:40.460
And then?

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.120
And then I-

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:48.140
went and told her it wasn't worth being friends if we weren't going to be anything more.

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.100
Holy crap! Dude, why would you say that???

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:53.320
What?

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.480
You're supposed to be on my side.

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.980
You're always talking about how you're the nice girl

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:59.380
who also gets overlooked.

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:00.740
Don't compare me to you.

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:03.240
Nice girls have our own unique set of problems,

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.660
the difference is you guys feel entitled to something because of your niceness,

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:08.540
us girls don't get that same privilege.

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:10.260
I don't feel entitled, I-

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:12.140
I just feel-

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.900
used.

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.060
or you're just feeling unwanted and you're taking it out on her.

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:21.180
STOP.

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.420
Arghhhh! You're making me think things

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.960
I need someone to blindly validate my feelings.

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:28.220
I knew it, man.

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:29.260
I

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:30.320
knew it.

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:31.920
And you know what pisses me off the most?

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:33.700
She's probably going to start dating some douchebag

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:38.020
with a douchy shirt and a douchy jacket that matches his douchy haircut.

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:40.040
What makes you say that?

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:40.840
I don't know.

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.800
It's a completely baseless accusation,

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.420
but I know that's what's going to happen

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:46.580
See, that's the problem with guys like you, Derek.

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.340
You get rejected and your world comes crashing down

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:50.860
but you never look at yourself

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:52.960
and instead blame everyone else.

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.660
What if this guy that she's dating is an amazing person?

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:58.180
and just because it isn't you, he is the douchebag

00:03:58.820 --> 00:03:59.720
and SHE'S a b*tch

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.200
What is with you and Julia today?

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:02.660
I'm just trying to say that

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:04.520
I've been that other guy before.

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:06.660
I know for a fact that when I dated this girl

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.380
the guy before that she rejected thought I was a douchebag.

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:11.120
But I'm not!

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:12.140
I'm awesome.

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:13.820
Why do you think you're friends with me?

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:17.160
And let's be real, he just wasn't right for her,

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:18.920
and a little lame.

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:20.580
But Lawrence,

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:22.220
you are a douchebag.

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:23.640
ohhh I'm a-

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:26.640
Hey, you called me lame. Okay?

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:28.300
and you can't deny girls like guys

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:29.640
with more of an edge.

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:32.440
Look, I'm not going to sit here and tell you to be something that you aren't.

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:34.560
Then what are we doing?

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:39.100
We're playing cards.

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:40.340
Bear with me now,

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:42.820
let's say...we're playing poker.

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.220
And you get dealt

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:46.680
a seven deuce.

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:49.540
You're trying to be make it straight with Audrey but

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:51.080
you just can't with these cards

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:53.440
I'd like to think

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:54.920
Audrey dealt a seven too

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:56.240
and I'm trying to build a full house

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:58.020
even if she did

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.020
the odds of you guys making a two seven full house

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:02.420
VERY unlikely

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:04.680
oh cool

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.180
so you're saying I never had a shot with her

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:07.780
thanks a lot Lawrence that was REALLY helpful

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:08.840
nonono

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:10.740
what you forgot to see is that

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:12.540
you have two clubs

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:15.020
so instead of going for a straight or a fullhouse

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:16.420
why not try a flush?

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:18.380
you gotta rethink your strategy

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:20.240
or

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:21.440
cut your losses

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:22.060
fold

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:23.560
and start a new hand

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:25.240
or bluff

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:27.380
I'm lost

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:31.900
she said it'd be messed up if I decided not to be friends with her anymore

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:33.320
bUT

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:35.740
she KNOWS that I'm nice

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:37.280
and that I wouldn't be that petty

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:39.920
and you want to prove to her that you

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:40.560
are

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:43.900
I think she believes that I would never truly remove myself from her

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:44.980
so

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:47.440
I'm going to show her what it's like to really be gone

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:48.500
not a friend

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:49.700
not a nice guy

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:51.620
and she might be pissed off at first

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:52.420
bUT

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:54.400
ultimately she'll realize how important I was

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:56.660
and in that absence of THAT guy

00:05:57.780 --> 00:05:59.220
she'll realize that she actually DID like me

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:01.640
that's REALLY risky

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:03.320
you're going against the house

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:06.180
I'm going all in

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:09.200
I'm going to stop this analogy

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:10.180
is it too much?

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:11.340
just a little bit

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:11.840
sorry

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:17.660
song: stampede by year of the ox

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:45.540
hey Derek !

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:47.100
oh hey Abe !

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:48.140
Where were you Saturday?

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:49.880
for Audrey's potluck for the game?

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:52.180
oh we don't really hang out anymore

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:54.460
um she was sorta leading me on

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:56.500
what?! really?

00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:58.360
don't tell her I said that though

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:00.360
and um be careful around her

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:02.980
Derek

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:05.820
how many outfits should we bring for our graduation photoshoot?

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:07.680
oh uh about that ...

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.280
um I can't anymore...

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:11.160
what?!

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:12.920
that's so last minute !

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:14.360
Audrey and all of us had made plans !

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:15.180
I just...can't

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:16.400
um

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:18.620
that day uh my camera is

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:19.700
broken

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:20.740
so sorry

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:25.220
hey !!

00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:25.720
hi

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:26.940
Sandra right?

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:28.040
Audrey's cousin

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:29.580
yea we met last quarter

00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:30.140
right..

00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:31.980
I think she gave you my ladder

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:33.260
could I get that back?

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:34.960
oh yea sure

00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:41.540
hey Derek ?

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:42.260
yea

00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:43.640
do you

00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:46.960
happen to know anyone with an ID that I can borrow?

00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:48.320
what for?

00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:50.780
some of my friends are going to a party this weekend

00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:52.420
and we just need to get in

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:54.920
Audrey obviously isn't helping

00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:18.760
what a baller

00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:24.740
rip $1,000

00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:34.100
is he still not responding?

00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:36.560
no! and he doesn't even open my snaps anymore

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:37.140
what?!

00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:38.120
hey guys!

00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:41.740
finally!! where you been?

00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:43.620
I dropped my phone two days ago

00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:44.820
it was this whole thing..

00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:47.140
why are you dressed like a fckboi?

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:48.420
yeaaa

00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:50.780
you look like me you biter!

00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:52.140
I'm just

00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:52.680
dressing

00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:53.560
fashionably

00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:55.140
wait

00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:58.540
is this part of your bet against Audrey?

00:08:59.200 --> 00:08:59.700
no

00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:02.080
yes

00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:17.400

00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:19.780
