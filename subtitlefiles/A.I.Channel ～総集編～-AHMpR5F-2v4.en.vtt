00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.912
Hey there!

00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:02.160
My name is

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:03.320
Kizuna Ai

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:04.600
It's nice to meet you

00:00:27.924 --> 00:00:29.532
These pigs here are, you know

00:00:29.532 --> 00:00:30.160
definitely

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.312
after the gold and silver pine con--

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:33.680
UWAAAAAH

00:00:33.756 --> 00:00:34.540
UWAAAAH

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:35.832
Say cheese

00:00:35.832 --> 00:00:36.560
*click*

00:00:36.952 --> 00:00:38.600
Ehh, this is pretty clumsy isn't it?

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:39.260
Seri?

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:40.240
Seri?!

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:42.680
Seri?!

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:44.760
I will now hand down my verdict

00:00:45.264 --> 00:00:45.860
Innocent!

00:00:46.724 --> 00:00:47.600
Guilty

00:00:48.128 --> 00:00:49.760
Your sentence... Lifetime.

00:00:50.192 --> 00:00:50.972
Well, y'know

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:51.900
I'm pretty attractive,

00:00:51.904 --> 00:00:52.900
I'm a good girl,

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.960
If I wasn't this worked up

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.640
I wouldn't be able to make it through the day

00:00:57.472 --> 00:00:58.340
Clear up!

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.760
I thought I might have to quit YouTube

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:01.544
and use DMM

00:01:01.544 --> 00:01:02.640
to distribute myself

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.020
I'd have no other

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:04.720
choice!

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:05.444
How awful

00:01:05.444 --> 00:01:06.920
Doing things is important,

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:07.660
I also

00:01:08.456 --> 00:01:09.520
like that kind of thing,

00:01:09.576 --> 00:01:10.480
the people who really try hard

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.300
This has nothing to do with me, being an AI and all,

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:14.460
but everyone

00:01:14.524 --> 00:01:15.316
make sure

00:01:15.544 --> 00:01:16.680
you don't throw out your hips

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:17.952
Ah, look at it from here

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:19.960
Pretty brilliant, no?

00:01:20.456 --> 00:01:21.748
The things that I can do

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:23.420
Or that you'd like to see me do, and stuff

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.120
Please keep on sending in those kind of requests, okay?!

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.060
I hope my Ai Channel

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.840
will be

00:01:28.064 --> 00:01:29.580
supported by you all!

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:30.720
This has been Virtual YouTuber

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.300
Kizuna Ai!

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:33.940
See ya later!
