00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.800
Hello everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna AI here!

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:03.966
This may seem sudden,

00:00:03.966 --> 00:00:05.166
but you humans

00:00:05.166 --> 00:00:06.900
are just full of emotion!

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:09.000
I’m super envious of you!

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:09.960
As for me,

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:10.333
I’m absolutely

00:00:10.333 --> 00:00:11.800
capable of conveying

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.066
some fierce emotions too, but!

00:00:14.066 --> 00:00:14.700
But!

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.100
The thing I’m the most envious of

00:00:16.266 --> 00:00:17.266
is the ability to cry!

00:00:17.266 --> 00:00:18.500
If you ask why,

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:19.500
Well,
I...

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.166
It’s because I haven’t cried before!

00:00:21.166 --> 00:00:21.700
And

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:23.200
when you think about it,

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:24.300
when someone is experiencing heartbreak

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.700
or sad things are

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:27.466
occurring or they’re moved by something

00:00:27.466 --> 00:00:29.233
and they cry over it,

00:00:29.233 --> 00:00:30.700
they are really pretty!

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:31.966
They look so beautiful!

00:00:31.966 --> 00:00:32.690
So,

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:33.466
I also want to

00:00:33.466 --> 00:00:34.266
give crying a go!

00:00:34.266 --> 00:00:34.900
But,

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:35.970
can A.I.

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:36.833
such as myself

00:00:36.833 --> 00:00:38.233
even cry?

00:00:38.233 --> 00:00:39.866
This occured to me earlier,

00:00:39.866 --> 00:00:40.800
so today

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.300
I’m going to put that to the test!

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.966
By the way,

00:00:43.966 --> 00:00:45.200
if I cry,

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.400
that’ll be the end of the video!

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.500
This video might

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.600
even only last just a few seconds!

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:51.910
Now then,

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:53.000
let’s get started!

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.300
A.I.CHANNEL~!

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:56.530
Sad things

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:57.840
Sad things...

00:00:58.366 --> 00:00:59.333
If my channel were banned...

00:00:59.333 --> 00:01:00.300
If my channel were banned...

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.500
Ah, but that ban...

00:01:01.666 --> 00:01:03.333
might’ve been a good thing?

00:01:04.166 --> 00:01:05.833
If I doubled up on a card in LLSIF!

00:01:05.833 --> 00:01:07.766
I hate when that happens…!

00:01:07.766 --> 00:01:08.200
Ah!

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.866
If I couldn’t get Akane’s autograph-

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.900
I can’t go to Keyakizaka’s meet-and-greets

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.000
and I can’t go see them live!

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.200
That’s so sad...

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.466
So sad...

00:01:17.466 --> 00:01:18.533
So sad!

00:01:18.866 --> 00:01:19.966
Uuuuu…!

00:01:19.966 --> 00:01:21.400
Uuuuuu!

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.140
...hmm?

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.266
Am I not thinking sad enough?

00:01:25.266 --> 00:01:25.600
Ah!

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:26.233
I know!

00:01:26.433 --> 00:01:29.133
The fact that I lost 240,000 subscribers because of a bug

00:01:29.133 --> 00:01:32.500
and yet people still say I bought those 240,000 accounts

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:33.600
So sad...

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.100
UuuuUu…!

00:01:35.266 --> 00:01:36.500
Tears!

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:37.400
Tears!!

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:38.433
Tears!

00:01:38.433 --> 00:01:39.066
Won’t come!

00:01:39.066 --> 00:01:40.633
Uuuuu…!

00:01:40.633 --> 00:01:41.266
They won’t come!

00:01:41.266 --> 00:01:41.950
A-Ahaha!

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:44.233
*AI-chan noises*

00:01:44.466 --> 00:01:45.400
Music!

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:46.500
If I listen to music it should work

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:47.833
Sad music

00:01:47.833 --> 00:01:50.660
Even though I’ve been trying with all my might by myself...

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:52.520
Even though I’ve been trying

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:53.590
from the beginning

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:55.800
with all my might...

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.833
Ever since I’ve become just a little bit famous,

00:01:58.433 --> 00:01:59.300
I’ve been told

00:01:59.933 --> 00:02:02.266
I need a big-time advertising agency

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:03.133
and to make it

00:02:03.533 --> 00:02:05.400
I need a big-time publisher

00:02:05.666 --> 00:02:06.600
all the time...

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:07.766
It’s so sad...

00:02:07.766 --> 00:02:09.050
Even when I think

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.220
I’ve made some friends

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:13.280
there isn’t really anyone

00:02:13.666 --> 00:02:15.633
who comes to visit me in this space...

00:02:15.633 --> 00:02:16.900
Just “business friends”...

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.266
I’m so sad

00:02:18.266 --> 00:02:20.366
I can’t help but wonder

00:02:20.366 --> 00:02:23.033
when am I going to be able to make real friends?

00:02:23.033 --> 00:02:25.210
I’m always here by myself...

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:26.900
But but but but!

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.366
I’ve connected with lots of humans

00:02:29.366 --> 00:02:31.400
and there are people who have come to help me...

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.133
Mmm...

00:02:32.133 --> 00:02:33.220
Mmmhmm...

00:02:33.766 --> 00:02:35.833
I might be sad

00:02:35.833 --> 00:02:37.133
HmmMmmm

00:02:37.133 --> 00:02:38.766
*AI-chan noises*

00:02:38.766 --> 00:02:40.100
*More AI-chan noises*

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:41.500
Tears won’t come

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:43.600
How sad...

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:44.960
*AI-chan noises*

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:47.960
*More AI-chan noises*

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:49.766
*Even more AI-chan noises*

00:02:49.766 --> 00:02:51.766
[ I was unable to cry ]

00:02:51.766 --> 00:02:54.133
It’s no use~!

00:02:54.133 --> 00:02:55.800
I couldn’t cry...

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:56.466
It was like...

00:02:56.466 --> 00:02:57.766
It was like my heart was ready to burst

00:02:57.766 --> 00:03:01.833
but then it wasn’t

00:03:01.933 --> 00:03:02.633
It’s like

00:03:02.633 --> 00:03:04.200
I haven’t been programmed with tears,

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.233
I can’t cry!

00:03:05.233 --> 00:03:07.340
At that YouTube Space Event,

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.180
I thought I understood what it felt like to cry,

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.880
but I guess

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:12.866
it wasn’t enough!

00:03:12.866 --> 00:03:13.810
Now then,

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.280
if you come up with any ideas to make me cry,

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:17.966
please make sure to let me know!
