00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.780
Hi there, I'm Virtual Youtuber who wanted to have merchandises, Kizuna Ai!

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:04.520
What do you think?

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.200
I want to be merchandises you know?

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:09.860
I want to make scaled figures of myself into reality but..

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:11.320
I think it's going to be appealing but...

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:12.920
It sounds like I need lots of budget for that

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:14.480
but it sounds possible isn't it?

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:16.160
It's like throwing a changeup pitch,

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:17.720
that's what I thought so

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:20.160
I want to face this problem from another angle!

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:23.100
So, I thought by making a practical item

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.000
it'd be useful to everyone!

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:27.100
A thoroughly practical item,

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:29.840
that you can use everyday would be a good thing!

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:30.440
Right,

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:32.340
Something like an alarm clock!

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:33.960
For your work and school,

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:35.560
even private meetings,

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:36.660
you won't be late for it!

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:37.260
And then,

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.840
if you were to be late, I'll throw a rampage!

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.040
Being nice sometimes,

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:42.300
and being harsh the other times,

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:43.240
like a mother!

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.100
I'm going to wake you up like that!

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.080
But then,

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.360
A normal alarm clock is kinda outdated so,

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.220
there's already too many similar stuff like this you see..

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.320
So I think, the content is very important for this!

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.080
So with that, let's think up the contents!

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:57.640
For starters, as an example

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:59.880
I'll be doing lines for cliche situations first.

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:01.360
These things are pretty important too you see.

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:02.420
Come on,

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.000
how long are you going to sleep?

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:05.640
You're going to be late for work you know!

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.480
Didn't you late for work yesterday too?

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:08.240
Hey..

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:09.640
Hurry and wake up.

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:10.740
Wake uuuup!

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.220
Wake uuuuuup!

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.220
If you don't wake up I'll eat your breakfast you know!

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:15.620
You okay with that?

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:16.860
Wake! Up!

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:18.660
Wake uuuuuuuup!

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:20.080
How was it?

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:21.800
Umm, but

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.120
that feels like a normal alarm clock right?

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:25.140
By the way,

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.580
are you the type who snooze your alarm clock in an instant?

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.860
There are people who wake up and don't wake up to alarms right?

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.640
People snoozes the alarm for few times!

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.300
I think there are quite a lot of people like that!

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.380
Don't you think those people need more than just the normal alarm clock?

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:39.540
I wonder what to do with them..

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:41.220
I thought lots of things about that but,

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.140
since I'm a genius

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.760
I know what to do!

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.120
What if Ai-chan Alarm,

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.400
going to have different story routes!?

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:49.580
Am I not a genius?

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:50.840
Don't steal this idea, okay?

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:52.000
Let's try it out right now!

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.940
1.

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.620
1. Properly woke up with the alarm

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.920
Waah! You properly woke up didn't you?!

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.040
As expected from you!

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.020
I'll give you a perfect score!

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:03.540
Today is a good day, don't you think?

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:05.300
Eat your breakfast well,

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.460
and enjoy your morning time, okay?

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:08.240
2!

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.340
2. Snoozed the alarm, but didn't wake up.

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:12.480
Hey, hey..

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.020
Hurry and wake up?

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.160
It's already this late ya know!

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:17.880
Hmm..

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:19.560
I did wake you up, okay?

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:21.940
Don't blame me if you get late, okay?

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:23.040
3!

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.240
3. Didn't snooze the alarm and didn't wake up.

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.660
Why aren't you waking up even though I tried to wake you up!?

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:32.460
As a punishment,

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.340
I'll have you promote my channel to two person or more

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:36.360
...that's it.

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.980
4!

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:40.740
4. Woke up before the alarm rang.

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.160
Awful..

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.440
You didn't need me at all, did you!

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.380
[cries river]

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:47.280
Eh?

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.200
That's not the case?

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.720
Since you woke up early,

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.440
why don't you watch A.I. Channel?

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.080
With that,

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.880
would you think I'll be able to wake those people?

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.900
Don't you think it's pretty original?

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.120
Also,

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.400
an alarm for your 3 minutes cup noodle,

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:07.400
and..

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.300
limiting your play time or

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:10.860
limiting your study time!

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.160
Or wake you up from a nap?

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:15.820
It'd be great if it has those settings!

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.460
Don't you want to see other settings?

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:20.440
A lovely newly wed wife?

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.620
An imouto who loves her brother?

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.980
Or, different time zone settings?

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:26.400
Different gender?

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:28.380
There are many other options like that but

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:31.380
If I'd were to release it with all of those features it'd be too much so

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:32.420
I'll let you take a peek!

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:34.580
So I'm going to do some of it now!

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.060
So for starters,

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.320
for high schoolers or students,

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.860
An alarm to notify their time for study is over!

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:43.760
Time for study is over!

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:46.780
Great work! Aren't you a good student!

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:47.580
*pats you*

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:49.180
Now you can finally play, huh?

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:50.680
For the next,

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:51.720
is that

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.160
alarm for your cup noodle!

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:56.520
Your cup noodle is done!

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:57.480
It's fresh and hot!

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.040
If you don't hurry it'll get soggy you know!

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.340
I'm going to eat it you know?

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:01.540
Hurry up, hurry up!

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:03.040
For the next is,

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:05.380
how about a different day notification?

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.220
Since it's pretty depressing,

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:08.460
"Monday"

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:09.760
I want to try that.

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:12.760
Good morning! Wake up! It's Monday you know~

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:14.600
Eh, don't want Monday?

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:16.540
Since it's Monday it means,

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:17.680
it's not a day off so

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:18.860
Ai-chan's

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:19.700
video might

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:20.780
be uploaded you know!

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:21.860
Don't you look forward for it?

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:24.060
Do a good job at school or work,

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.080
and watch Ai-chan's video in the night!

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:27.680
Wake up! You can do it!

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:30.420
What do you think about Ai-chan alarm?

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:32.260
If such an alarm clock exists,

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:33.700
I wonder if you'll use it?

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:38.900
I'm seriously aiming for goods or app made,
so I'd be happy if you support me!

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:40.140
I'll be waiting for your support, okay?

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:41.780
Bye bye!

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:56.000
I want to be goods,

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:56.660
I want to be goods, I want to be goods,

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:57.300
I want to be goods, I want to be goods, I want to be goods,

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:58.120
I want to be goods, I want to be goods, I want to be goods, I want to be goods,

00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:58.680
I want to be goods, I want to be goods, I want to be goods, I want to be goods, I want to be goods,

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:59.260
I want-
