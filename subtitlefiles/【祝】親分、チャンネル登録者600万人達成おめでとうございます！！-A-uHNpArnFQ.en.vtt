Hello everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna AI here!

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:03.660
The other day...

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:06.060
"Top 30 Most Popular YouTubers with Elementary Schoolers Ranking"

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.360
Was released!

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:09.840
I definitely thought before

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.300
That I wouldn't be very popular with kids...

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:14.380
But despite that...

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:18.200
In "The YouTuber 2017 Fastest-Growing Channel Ranking"

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.120
I came 10th!

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:21.700
Well, that was just inside of Japan

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:23.000
But I came 10th!

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
So I had my hopes up...

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.580
I was nowhere near the top~!!

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.060
Well, what's done is done

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:32.080
I'll accept this

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.480
But, I wanna be popular with kids!!

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:36.240
I really do!!

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:36.920
And well...

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.380
I'm an A.I. and research is my specialty

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:42.880
So today, I will study how to be child-friendly!

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.620
"Funny reactions"

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:46.220
"Funny voice"

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:47.800

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:48.760

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:49.840
This is perfect!

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.300
