A: Man, even though I'm just humming, it's hard to write lyrics...

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.560
N: It's true

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.540
A: Definitely, that's right...

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:29.820
A: Hmm?

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.440
A: Since when were you here?!

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.380
A: How dare you enter without permission...

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:35.335
A: To the room of someone like me who seems to be a girl?

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.000
N: You seem like a girl?

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.420
N: You're not a girl?

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.740
A: To be honest, I'm still not sure...

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:42.360
N: *laughs*

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.580
N: I see, I thought you were a girl

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:48.360
A: Well, I have the appearance of a girl...

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.880
A: But with the mind of a man, something like that

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:52.600
N: You're quite erotic, aren't you?

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.880
A: It's true, I always try to get adorable girls in my summonings

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:59.320
N: Well, having said this, today we'll also...

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:00.880
N: Play Cryptract...

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.520
N: It's a pleasure to play with you!
A: Oooh, It's a pleasure!

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.160
A: It's true, this our 7th time playing, right?

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:07.920
N: We've already done that many?
A: Right?

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.140
N: We really have done a lot, haven’t we?
A: Right? We've truly have done a lot

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:11.760
N: Ooh

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.100
A: Of course, now that we are in the 7th episode, I wanted to ask you...
N: Yes, yes

00:01:15.165 --> 00:01:18.135
A: Did you know you can change the background of this place?

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.820
N: I didn't know, is that true?
A: Yes, it’s true!

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:21.320
N: Oh

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.420
A: Lately I've been using this picture-like background and it's become somewhat stereotyped...
N: Yes

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.240
A: You want to change it?
N: Not particularly, I'm fine like this

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.200
A: Ah, don't you want to try being a pink balloon?

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.560
N: You can change my appearance to a pink balloon?

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.120
A: That's right, I can do it
N: Well...

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:34.520
N: I think I'd rather pass this time...

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.080
A: Ah, I see

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.580
N: *laughs*

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:37.420
A: In that case...

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.980
A: How about we only change the background?

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:41.400
N: The background?

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.160
N: What kind of background?

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.620
A: Don't we have a Cryptract background?

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:46.960
N: Maybe we can do that?
A: Let's do it!

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.920
N: Oh, I want to see this!
A: Soiyaa!

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.840
A: What do you think?
N: It's incredible!

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.140
A: It's incredible, right?

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.180
N: It's a fantasy world, right?
A: That's right

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.620
A: This world is more suited to me, right?

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:58.720
N: Mmm?

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:00.920
N: More suited to you?
A: Yes

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.400
N: It's very suitable for you
A: Eh?

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.860
A: That's exactly what I've been saying!

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:07.860
A: Ah, have you brought some important manager with you?
(She asked last time to bring someone important)

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:10.800
N: I came from another place today too..

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.000
N: So then I didn't bring anyone with me

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.700
A: I think it's time for you to get popped
N: Don't pop me, please...

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.060
A: What if I change your color to pink?
N: No, not pink, please...

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:18.200
A: I see

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.320
A: Well, next time... I'm counting on you
N: Understood

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.420
A: NoriP-san...
N: I'll see to it that they determine the results

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:23.200
A: Good, good...

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.680
N: By the way, you said you'd create a support song...

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:27.360
A: Yes!

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:28.720
N: How has it been going?

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.280
A: Ah! Well, you know...!

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.540
A: I've been progressing steadily and there is little left to finish now!

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:35.480
N: Ah, really?

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.840
A: I've also been thinking about a promotion for the song

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.820
N: A promotion for the new song?

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:43.840
N: What's the purpose of creating this support song?

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.820
A: We'd be promoting Cryptract by promoting the support song

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.180
N: I see, that's to say, the ultimate goal is to promote Cryptract...

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.960
A: That's right!

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:54.400
A: I see you have understood!
N: I see, I didn't expect any less of you, Ai-chan

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.580
A: Right?
N: In that case, I'll leave it at your hands

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:57.540
A: That's right, and later...

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.400
A: The ultimate goal will be to promote Cryptract
N: Yes, yes?

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.400
A: You want to take a look?

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:04.460
A: I created a promotional video
N: We can see it?

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:05.200
N: You already created it?

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.600
A: Well, only one part, one part...

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.080
A: It still needs a little more...

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:09.200
N: You created it, Ai-chan, right?

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:10.400
A: That's right

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:11.480
N: Eeeeh?
A: Shall we see it?

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:12.760
N: I want to see it

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.940
*Planning - Lettering - Directing:
The super A.I KIZUNA AI*

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.020
*Kizuna Ai tries to create a support song for the mobile game "Genjuu Keiyaku Cryptract"*

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:27.560
A: Well, it's over!

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:29.740
A: What do you think? Doesn't it seem great?

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.500
N: No, well, this is Senbonzakura, right?

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.120
A: Well yes, you could say yes...

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:35.600
N: Is it okay to do this?

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:37.120
A: Well, well, well...

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:37.900
A: Please look...

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.140
A: Wait anxiously for next time!

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.260
N: It looks great, right?

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.160
N: Isn’t the music and BM both great?

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.940
A: Right? Thank you very much!

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:48.640
N: It's because of that, that...

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.760
N: I'd also like to see you doing great on Cryptract

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.520
A: Ah, I see...

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:56.960
N: Yes
A: Of course I will, of course

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:58.640
N: And for today...

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:02.100
N: I want you to try a quest
A: Yes... Oh!

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.140
N: There's a quest called "Grimm's Labyrinth"...
A: Uh huh... Ah!

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.220
N: Will you do it?

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.040
A: I'll do it!
N: You will?

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:11.400
A: But it's hard, right?

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:12.220
N: I suppose it’s hard...

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:14.900
A: I haven't... tried doing quests yet...
N: Yes?

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:15.660
N: I see...

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:19.880
N: Well, "Grimm's Labyrinth" is a quest for advanced players...
A: I see... yes...

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.520
N: You can't "Continue" in this quest...
A: Of course, right?

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.640
N: It's incredibly difficult, but...
A: Hmm...

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:26.660
N: Well, if it's about you, Ai-chan...

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.780
A: Well, of course! If it's about me...

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:30.980
N: I thought it might be possible if it's "Union Master" Ai-chan...

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:34.000
A: That's right! If it's like "Union Master" me...

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:35.880
A: If it's like "Super A.I" me...

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:37.580
A: There's no way I wouldn't be able to, right?

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:38.700
N: Right?

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.840
N: Well, shall we do it then?
A: Ah!

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:41.900
A: Yes... let's!

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:43.780
N: By the way, this time...
A: Yes...

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:45.320
N: "There'll be no hints"

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:46.280
A: “No hints”?

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:47.580
N: That’s what they told me

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:49.000
A: I see...
N: Yes

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.380
A: That means that the units are locked, right?

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:53.780
N: That's right
A: No hints...

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:56.260
A: "No hints"
N: That's right, you have invited members...

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:59.060
A: Well, it’ll be a piece of cake for a Super A.I like me...

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:00.960
N: Well, I suppose it’s a piece of cake, right?
A: It’ll be a piece of cake

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:01.952
N: Shall we do it?

00:05:01.952 --> 00:05:03.950
A: Yes! Please look
N: Yes

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:06.850
A: Alright, so I’ll go ahead with this unit then!

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:08.970
A: I just saw it for a second, but...

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:11.160
A: Ah, incredible! It looks very strong. Really strong!

00:05:11.613 --> 00:05:12.860
N: Alright, so what should we do to start off?

00:05:12.866 --> 00:05:14.860
A: That's right, first off we…
N: Yes...

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:16.283
A: What? I died?

00:05:16.283 --> 00:05:16.783
A: Eh?

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:18.320
A: Eh? Wait!

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:19.869
A: This is weird, this is weird, this is weird...

00:05:20.901 --> 00:05:21.883
A: They use a lot of....

00:05:22.501 --> 00:05:24.581
N: Yes?
A: Reviving and other things, so even if I die…

00:05:26.756 --> 00:05:28.421
N: What do you think? Are things going well so far?

00:05:29.003 --> 00:05:29.723
A: Does it...

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:31.100
A: Look like things are going well?

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:32.160
N: *laughs*

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:33.480
A: Ahhhhh!

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:37.090
N: I think it’s best to restart the mission...

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:38.247
A: Ah! Let’s restart!

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:40.300
A: Okay! So with that being said…!

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:40.800
N: *laughs*

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:42.200
A: I think I’d like to take the challenge!

00:05:42.436 --> 00:05:43.490
A: But, since I’m seeing it for the first time…
*First time (Lie)*

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:44.872
A: I’m not sure if I can do it well
N: Good, let’s do it

00:05:44.872 --> 00:05:45.900
A: I’m not sure, but...

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:46.550
N: That’s true

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:47.730
A: Well, then again, since I’m a super A.I...

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:49.134
A: I’m pretty sure I can succeed...

00:05:49.134 --> 00:05:49.930
A: So then, observe me!

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:50.400
N: It’s true

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:52.050
N: If you properly make the best use the various skills that you have...

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:55.620
A: Yes
N: Well, if you can do it well, you can complete the quest

00:05:55.672 --> 00:05:56.172
A: Alright!

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:57.540
N: Try your best, please

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:58.230
A: I’ll try my best!

00:05:58.230 --> 00:05:59.069
N: Good
A: Here I go!

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:01.180
A: First...!

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:02.560
N: First is, yes...

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:05.780
A: First I’ll use Yaoyorozu-chan
N: The enemy is called Providence

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.460
A: Providence? Oh!
N: He’s super strong

00:06:09.265 --> 00:06:12.135
A: Seems like Providence, alright
N: Seems like Providence, right?

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:14.160
N: It looks strong, doesn't it?

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:15.845
A: Yeah well, it’s appearance looks dangerous...

00:06:15.845 --> 00:06:16.840
A: This is dangerous, right?

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:18.560
N: Good, so what shall we do first?

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:21.080
A: For starters, let’s use Sanzensekai 
(“The Universe”)

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:22.140
N: Oh, good choice...

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:22.800
A: Oh!

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:26.280
A: This is really pretty...

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:30.700
N: It has a special skill...

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:34.200
A: Okay, okay… mmm... ah!
N: And it does a lot of damage...

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:36.620
N: Ah! It's dangerous!
A: It's dangerous!

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:38.180
A: Ah! I'm alive!

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:39.760
N: By the way... um...
A: Hm?

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:43.820
N: Here, what order you attack the enemies is also important...

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:45.480
A: Yes! Teacher!

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:47.740
N: Yes?
A: First, I'll destroy the small fry....

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:50.760
A: I’ll start by defeating this purple jelly balls

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:53.680
N: This is A.I's winning strategy, right?

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:55.040
A: Hehehe...you’re mistaken?

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:56.220
N: *laughs*

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:57.900
N: No, I’m right

00:06:57.900 --> 00:06:59.080
A: Of course
N: Yes, yes

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:01.660
N: The basic strategy is... well, to start with the small fry...

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:03.820
A: It’s true
N: Something like that, yes

00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:04.480
A: Good

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:09.120
A: That means that I’ll paralyze this jelly, go for it!

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.360
A: Ah, good, good, good, I paralyzed it!

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:14.340
A: Eh, it died?

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:17.660
A: You know, what happened before was only a dream...

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:20.160
A: Well, Arma was the first to die...

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:21.100
N: *laughs* Yes...

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:21.600
N: Ah...

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:22.560
N: A dream...

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:24.200
N: It’s true, I probably saw the same dream...

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:26.320
A: Ah, what a coincidence...
N: Yes, a coincidence...

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:27.700
A: It must be because it’s the 7th time we’re doing this...

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:28.560
N: It’s true…

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:29.740
A: Maybe we’ve synchronized minds a bit…

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:32.340
N: After all, we’ve been playing a lot, right?
A: That’s right

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:35.520
A: I'm directing all the attacks towards Arma right now...
N: Yes, yes...

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:37.080
A: Once Arma dies...

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:39.480
A: Well, she’ll revive once again...

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:41.340
A: And I'd like to have her do the same thing again...

00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:42.220
N: I see...
A: Hmm...

00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:43.500
N: Could it be that it's because…?

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:45.900
N: Arma has...

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:48.980
N: "The Blessing of 1"?
A: That’s right, that’s right
*Arma has "The Blessing of 1": Even if your HP drops to 1, you can sustain a few hits*

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:51.380
N: So, even if Arma takes consecutive hits...

00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:52.880
A: Yes, yes, exactly that...

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:54.300
A: Because Arma will stay alive for me

00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:55.640
N: I see...
A: That's right

00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:58.680
N: So Arma is quite essential to this, right?

00:07:58.680 --> 00:07:59.580
A: Yes, that's right

00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:01.720
N: What’s your strategy?

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:03.220
A: For the moment...

00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:05.200
A: I’ll defeat the purple jellies
N: Oh? The jellies...

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:07.840
A: Then, I'll direct all the attacks towards Arma...
N: Oh...

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:10.240
A: For the moment, it’ll reduce...

00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:11.460
N: Doesn’t this look good?

00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:12.720
A: It... it’s good, right?
N: Ah...

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:16.160
N: And also, you have the revival...

00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:17.940
N: So then, you rely on Arma, right?
A: Yes, that's right!

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.860
N: I see, so even if Arma is defeated, she'll revive
A: She'll revive...

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:22.700
A: "The Bl□△☆× of 1"...

00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:24.680
A: Because she has "The Blessing of 1"

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:25.960
N: Did you just stutter?

00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:27.160
A: Eh?
N: Hmm?

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:28.780
A: I stuttered~ ⁀(๑˃ڡ˂๑)⁀

00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:30.600
A: Eh?

00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:31.860
A: This doesn’t look...

00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:34.180
A: OUCH! Eh? Wait...

00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:38.540
A: I've casted revive on them, they should revive… you see?

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:41.020
A: Ahhhh! 
N: Ohhh!

00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:43.020
N: It looks like it’s working, right?
A: Yes, that’s right

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:44.580
A: But Sphere-chan is...

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:45.875
N: Eh?

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:47.880
A: Oh, this! This!

00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:50.060
A: I can use this! Yes!

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:53.360
A: There we go!
N: That’s what it looks like

00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:56.240
N: Sphere has been revived, right?
A: Yes, she revived

00:08:58.100 --> 00:08:58.920
A: Ahhh!

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:01.740
A: AH!

00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:05.680
A: Aaah!

00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:12.720
N: I feel like this is like a bad dream...

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:14.000
A: It’s true...

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.135
N: Man, I feel like I'm having a bad dream
A: It’s true, that's weird

00:09:17.135 --> 00:09:18.420
N: Good...!
A: Yes!

00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:19.605
N: Shall we begin?

00:09:19.605 --> 00:09:21.220
A: Good! So let's begin!

00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:23.420
A: Alright, let's go! Ah, everyone is so adorable!

00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:24.940
N: Alright, let's go!
A: Yes!

00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:28.700
N: By the way, it turns out that in the dream, I saw...

00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:31.280
N: That Yaoyorozu was actually beaten...

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:33.080
A: Ahhh… then that's not good! Right?
N: That's not good...

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:36.720
N: If that happens, it's probably impossible to clear the quest...

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:39.140
A: I wish you said this before we started...

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:42.620
N: Well, you need to make sure Yaoyorozu doesn’t die...
A: But...

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:45.855
A: In the dream… I think there was a guy called NoriP-san…
N: Yes, yes

00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:48.980
A: Who said things like: "You can still do it!", right?
N: *laughs*

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:52.580
N: I see, I wasn't aware of that...

00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:56.515
A: Well, I was hoping you would say that earlier.. even though we are talking about a dream, right?

00:09:56.520 --> 00:10:02.440
N: That means that the key is for Yaoyorozu to not take any damage...

00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:06.260
N: That Arma can take the hits...

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:08.340
N: While reviving and then defeat the enemies...

00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:09.180
A: Hmm, hm, hmm...

00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:12.740
A: That means that if you don't prepare your attacks, it’d really hurt...
N: That’s right

00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:17.540
A: If not, I can't move on!
N: Yes, a while ago in dream, I already thought that it was impossible...

00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:18.600
N: Sphere...
A: My allies...

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:21.360
N: They have the ability to aggro the enemy, right?

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:24.240
A: Right, teacher! She does have it, but…
N: Yes, yes...

00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:26.320
A: Arma-chan...
N: Yes, what is it?

00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:28.340
A: Already has 0 HP, so then…
N: Yes, yes, yes...

00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:30.840
A: So if I take successive attacks...
N: Yes

00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:31.820
A: I might die...

00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:33.160
N: I see, yes...
A: That means that...

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:34.560
A: Well...

00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:37.980
A: I'd rather place a revive spell to revive my allies...
N: I see...

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:40.320
N: Oh? I can’t give a hint here
A: Argh!

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:41.320
A: What should I do?

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:44.840
A: Ah! Please wait!

00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:47.620
A: In this case, the others might also be able to do it!

00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:49.340
A: Ah, but... but… good, good...
N: Hmm...

00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:51.020
A: This time, I still have a chance!

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:53.820
N: That looks good
A: That looks good, right?

00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:55.720
Both: *laughs*

00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:58.840
N: You're a bit, a bit in a dream, right?
A: It’s useless...

00:10:58.840 --> 00:10:59.340
N: *laughs*

00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:01.060
A: I’ll use Sphere-chan...
N: Calm down

00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:03.240
A: I’ll use her skill...

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:06.320
A: Then!
N: What are you going to do now?

00:11:06.340 --> 00:11:09.760
A: Right now, that... hmm... I'm already doing my best...
N: Yes

00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:13.520
A: I want to aggro the attacks to Arma-chan, but...

00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:14.080
N: Yes...

00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:17.180
A: I still haven't used the skill for aggro...

00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:19.500
N: I see
A: So, I’m in trouble...

00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:22.600
N: But, you can still revive...

00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:23.480
A: It’s true, but...

00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:26.200
A: Other than that, other than that...

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:28.000
A: It would be like what happened awhile ago, like when it was in a dream...
N: Yes

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.200
A: If the attacks goes to Yaoyorozu and she dies...

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:32.360
A: It’d be the end...

00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:33.120
N: I see...

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:34.060
A: I'm in trouble

00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:35.280
A: Ah, ah, I survived

00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:37.100
A: Then, I let her aggro them...

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:38.360
A: Good
N: Do you also have Cherio?

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:40.600
A: Cherio? I got it!

00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:44.020
N: Well, Cherio can reduce skill cooldown, so then...

00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:47.560
A: Ah, yes, yes!
N: How to reduce your cooldown is a key point too

00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:50.240
A: Yes, that's true
N: So you have Yaoyorozu...

00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:52.920
N: Who shouldn’t be taking any hits
A: Ooh...

00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:56.580
N: What happened?
A: For now, I just need to... for the moment, well, yes...

00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:59.220
A: Grab all the opportunities, right?
N: That's right

00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:04.040
N: You need to use... your skill cooldown reduce on Sphere?

00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:07.860
N: By aggroing Arma...

00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:11.160
N: During his resurrection period where he can’t fight...

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:14.080
A: To cast that ability is a good idea don’t you think?

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:14.940
A: Oh... what?

00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:17.300
A: Wasn't I putting a spell there?

00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:18.360
N: No, I think you're already...

00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:21.360
N: Defeated and took another hit?

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:22.080
A: You're lying!

00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:25.620
A: Eh... to me, they didn't die...

00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:29.740
N: About that... well, it's still fine, you can still do it

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.640
A: I'm sure I can
N: The one that just appeared is Kyle, right?

00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:34.840
A: Yes, it’s Kyle...

00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:38.820
A: I should give it to Kyle, give it the same role as Arma
N: That's right

00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:43.640
A: Then, if I don't hurry to concentrate my attacks...

00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:47.220
A: Yaoyorozu-chan is a bit lacking in HP...

00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:48.420
A: Right now... ah, she died...

00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:53.680
N: Look, Providence’s health has been reduced a lot

00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:56.720
A: That's right! Looks good

00:12:56.720 --> 00:13:01.360
A: But this... I should give it to Yaoyorozu, right?

00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:05.020
A: Because her HP is already near 0, so...
N: Eh?

00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:08.240
N: Yes, yes, yes
A: Like, when her allies are all incapacitated...

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:09.960
N: I see...
A: So she can revive then...

00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:11.560
A: I’m going to cast the revival skill on her...

00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:16.160
A: And then, Arma can now the hits...

00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:19.640
N: Isn't it good?
A: Nice, nice, nice...

00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:23.340
N: Isn't it good?
A: At least, for now, Yaoyorozu isn't going to die...

00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:30.460
A: Ah, she revived, it's starting to look good

00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:33.620
A: I'm so good
N: Just now... it’s having an effect on...

00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:34.780
N: The revival is definitely working...

00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:37.580
A: Good!

00:13:38.740 --> 00:13:40.000
N: Hm, why?
A: AH!

00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:44.700
A: Eh? I didn't let her concentrate there?

00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:46.380
N: What... did that just happen?

00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:49.180
A: Hmm... Sphere just died...

00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:52.360
N: Damn, you're in trouble..

00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:54.940
A: Eh... this, the skill's effect...

00:13:54.940 --> 00:13:57.660
A: The buff's effect doesn't last forever? It stops at some point?

00:13:57.660 --> 00:13:58.440
N: Ah, of course it doesn't...

00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:03.300
N: So you should keep using the skill on him...

00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:05.000
A: Please say this beforehand...

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:06.400
N: *laughs*

00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:10.200
N: It’s basic Cryptract’s...

00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:11.240
A: Even after all this hard work that I’ve been putting in

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:14.500
A: I wonder if I can even control myself this point...

00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:15.420
N: *laughs*

00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:18.200
N: Please keep going
A: That’s right, isn’t it?

00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:19.200
A: Let’s try our best

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:20.220
A: AAAAAAGH!

00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:23.040
A: *mumbles*

00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:23.900
N: Right...

00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:24.600
N: So...

00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:25.700
N: This...

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:27.800
N: Is becoming a bad dream so...

00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:28.400
A: AH!

00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:30.100
N: We should wake up from this dream~

00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:30.900
A: Right~

00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:34.500
A: That was a long dream! That dream!

00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:35.000
N: Nightmare...

00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:35.900
A: That was long...

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.400
N: Last... last?
A: Last? Last?

00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:40.600
N: Let’s go!
A: Right!

00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:42.180
A: Ah, after all since you can really only challenge yourself once...

00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:43.200
A: As expected, we can only do this once...

00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:44.200
N: Right. Only once...

00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:45.480
A: If I can’t do it, then it’s over
N: Yes

00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:48.300
N: Um, about the dream...

00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:49.600
N: We were in before
A: Yes

00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:50.400
N: We did good

00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:53.600
A: Ah, really? Hmm...
N: Using Yaoyorozu, an attack...

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:59.600
A: Mhm, hmmm...
N: Using Sphere, you can take Arma’s aggro, and then use Kyle, right?

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:00.600
N: By provoking Gouriki…

00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:03.600
N: You’ll be able to start the Yaoyorozu

00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:05.080
A: I see
N: Yes

00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:06.880
N: Fight
A: I see... I can do that

00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:10.200
A: In the dream, we did a good simulation, right?

00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:12.280
A: In reality, it was precise...
N: Right

00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:13.640
A: Let me do it!

00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:15.400
Both: Three-Thousand Worlds! 
(Ability name)

00:15:18.895 --> 00:15:22.305
N: There’s a chance it might use the special attack...

00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:23.440
N: Oh!
A: Oh!

00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:24.420
A: Ou..

00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:25.700
A: Then...

00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:30.340
A: First, I'll paralyze this thing...
N: Yeah, yeah

00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:32.300
N: Is this Cherio’s attack?

00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:33.940
A: You're right, it's Cherio’s...

00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:36.040
A: Yaoyorozu-chan, GO!

00:15:41.460 --> 00:15:42.660
A: Good! No one’s dead yet

00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:44.640
N: That's great, isn't it?

00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:46.540
A: But my HP is still...

00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:49.840
A: It's not bad
N: It's not bad at all

00:15:50.485 --> 00:15:51.485
A: Then!

00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:53.240
A: I’ll apply the aggro...

00:15:54.380 --> 00:15:57.580
A: Yes! Right, it's to Arma
N: So this is to Arma...

00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:00.140
A: Eh?

00:16:01.020 --> 00:16:02.500
N: Oh, that's tough...

00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:07.420
A: Well, they all died...
N: *laughs*

00:16:08.580 --> 00:16:11.100
N: Oh well, that's unfortunate
A: Oh well, it happens!

00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:13.260
N: If you take combos...

00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:16.120
N: Well, even though you have the blessing...

00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:17.560
N: But that's still too tough
A: Right… I know

00:16:17.975 --> 00:16:20.735
N: But you still have Kyle!
A: Yes, I do!

00:16:20.940 --> 00:16:22.920
A: I can still do this!
N: That's right

00:16:23.980 --> 00:16:27.360
A: Wait, but doesn’t this SP hook seem… from before a little more...?

00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:30.120
A: It's better than before in the dream!
N: Well, that was a dream, wasn’t it?

00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:31.660
A: Let’s aggro 
them right now

00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:36.020
A: Yes

00:16:36.380 --> 00:16:37.660
Cherio’s skill to reduce cooldown time...

00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:39.880
A: Ah! I've already used it! Perfect...

00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:42.000
A: Then! I’ll use the skill...

00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:44.360
A: To revive myself...

00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:46.640
A: Poi...

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.380
Both: And that unit cannot attack me next turn...

00:16:51.980 --> 00:16:52.480
A: Then...

00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:54.960
A: Again, we’ll use a skill to reduce our cooldowns...

00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:56.860
A: And we'll use it on Sphere

00:16:56.900 --> 00:16:58.220
N: (repeating what Ai-chan says)
A: Yes!

00:17:00.645 --> 00:17:01.645
N: Oh?!
A: Yes!

00:17:01.925 --> 00:17:04.885
Both: That's great!

00:17:04.885 --> 00:17:07.245
N: That didn't hit the other units
A: Yaaaay! That's right!

00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:10.000
A: Then! Oh? Can we do this?

00:17:10.620 --> 00:17:12.280
A: Can we kill that slime thing?

00:17:12.420 --> 00:17:13.380
A: Maybe?

00:17:13.860 --> 00:17:15.860
A: Yeeees! It’s going really well!

00:17:16.100 --> 00:17:18.700
N: That's great! It’s going to be important from here on...
A: Indeed...

00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:20.920
A: Up to now, it’s the same as before

00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:22.920
A: Eh? I can't revive?

00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:24.880
A: Shiiit...

00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:28.560
A: When they swarm me… I feel itchy

00:17:30.140 --> 00:17:33.240
A: Spell! In any case… you know? The attacks are coming in less and less

00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:35.380
A: Good, good, good timing!

00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:37.500
A: I want to...

00:17:37.540 --> 00:17:38.540
A: Keep provoking it, but...

00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:42.260
N: *laughs*

00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:44.280
N: You just lost confidence, didn’t you?

00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:48.840
A: As long as Yaoyorozu doesn’t die, it’s okay...
N: Yes

00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:51.820
A: AHHHH! GOODBYE!

00:17:56.460 --> 00:17:57.200
A: Um...

00:17:58.200 --> 00:17:59.880
A: Uh...

00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:03.740
N: We're watching a bad dream, aren't we?

00:18:03.740 --> 00:18:04.300
A: That's right...

00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:06.760
N: Well, you definitely had some luck… 
A: Yes...

00:18:07.060 --> 00:18:08.460
N: But it's getting somewhat hard...

00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:09.940
A: So basically you’re saying I had no luck to begin with...

00:18:09.940 --> 00:18:10.820
A: Last one, let's go!

00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:11.380
N: Let's go!

00:18:11.980 --> 00:18:13.420
N: We woke up from the dream...

00:18:13.420 --> 00:18:14.460
A: Yes, we did, it's not a dream now...

00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:16.360
N: Okay, let's go...

00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:16.860
A: Okay

00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:17.360
A: It's real now

00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:18.040
A: Good

00:18:18.140 --> 00:18:19.200
A: I've become really strong!

00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:20.500
A: Three-Thousand Worlds!

00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:26.000
A: Good!

00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:26.600
N: Good!

00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:28.500
N: That was some good damage there
A: Yes, it was

00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:29.420
A: AH!

00:18:29.420 --> 00:18:29.920
A: Ah….

00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:31.940
A: Le… let...

00:18:32.060 --> 00:18:32.600
A: I'm alive

00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:33.200
A: I can do it.
N: Right here...

00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:34.300
A: Let’s go!

00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:36.100
A: First.. I’ll paralyze you, purple jelly!

00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:37.300
A: Alright!

00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:39.700
N: Whose turn is it?

00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:41.060
A: It’s...

00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:42.580
N: Yaoyorozu?

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:44.100
A: Yaoyorozu right?
N: Yes

00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:46.940
A: I can use the electric attack
N: You can use the electric attack

00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:49.120
A: HIYAAAA!

00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:54.020
A: I can aggro this...

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:00.000
A: Ah, this...

00:19:02.020 --> 00:19:03.960
N: Ah, this one is the death call

00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:06.460
Both: AAAAAAH!

00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:09.400
N: Ah, that really did it, didn’t it?

00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:10.880
A: Ah, but... right...
N: But there’s still Kyle

00:19:10.980 --> 00:19:11.480
N: Ah

00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:14.260
A: First, here, for Yaoyorozu-chan...
N: Yes

00:19:15.100 --> 00:19:16.100
A: Skill Cooldown...

00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:17.800
A: Three turns...

00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:21.440
A: I’ll apply it to her

00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:23.900
A: I'll make it so I can use my skill

00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:24.480
A: Good

00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:32.320
A: How’s that!?

00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:35.660
N: Good one
A: A perfect one… totally!

00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:38.740
A: Earlier... yes, in a dream...
N: In a dream

00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:41.820
A: Stop!

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:42.720
A: Stop...

00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:44.180
A: Hitting me!

00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:47.260
A: I’ll use this on Yaoyorozu-chan to revive her if she dies...

00:19:50.805 --> 00:19:53.645
N: You’re taking aggro, right?
A: Ah, I can’t take aggro right now

00:19:55.205 --> 00:19:56.125
A: Now, right after this ability

00:19:56.125 --> 00:19:57.280
A: I will cast a resurrection

00:19:57.340 --> 00:19:58.960
A: On my front line

00:20:01.180 --> 00:20:02.180
A: Now… what do I do here?

00:20:04.060 --> 00:20:05.640
A: Can I cast this on myself?

00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:08.240
A: It says “Single Ally”, so..

00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:10.420
N: Right now you can cast it you know… Sphere, right?
A: I can?

00:20:10.605 --> 00:20:13.515
A: Not Sphere, I don’t mean Arma...

00:20:13.595 --> 00:20:16.545
A: On Kyle... I can even cast it on myself
N: Oh, Kyle, yes...

00:20:18.435 --> 00:20:19.435
A: Please don’t die...

00:20:21.695 --> 00:20:22.695
A: And then!

00:20:22.820 --> 00:20:24.040
A: Cooldown buff, for 3 turns...

00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:26.100
A: I’ll use it on Sphere...

00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:26.740
N: Yes

00:20:27.140 --> 00:20:28.660
A: Then, I’d want to switch aggro

00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:32.620
A: Oh

00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:33.640
A: It's okay...

00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:35.680
A: It's okay, it's okay...

00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:39.100
A: I can still go...

00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:41.680
A: OOOOOH! That's dangerous...

00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:44.400
A: Gimme the aggro!
N: Yes...

00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:47.300
A: Give the aggro to Kyle!

00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:49.160
A: Kyle’s...

00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:50.440
N: Eh?

00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:52.920
A: Has lost consciousness…

00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:54.200
N: *laughs*

00:20:56.120 --> 00:20:57.000
A: I only have 3 characters left...

00:20:57.120 --> 00:20:57.620
N: Oh!

00:20:57.620 --> 00:20:58.740
A: Oh, but!

00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:00.100
A: The way the HP is reduced...

00:21:00.980 --> 00:21:02.120
A: I'm doing good right?

00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:05.320
N: Well, you want to use Three-Thousand Worlds, smash it in, right?

00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:06.000
A: Yes, that's right!

00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:07.900
N: You’d want to do a two-turn attack...

00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:08.520
A: That's what I'm going to do

00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:09.220
A: Ahhh!

00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:10.100
A: Ah, but...

00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:11.280
A: I can still revive them!

00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:12.040
A: Good

00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:13.040
A: So…

00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:15.040
A: There’s lots of water power

00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:16.100
A: So...

00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:17.680
A: And if I use that!

00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:19.020
A: I'm in trouble!

00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:22.720
A: Nice, she revived
N: Yes, yes

00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:23.460
A: Then once more...

00:21:24.740 --> 00:21:28.740
A: Which one should I be using this on, Yaoyorozu-chan, right?
N: A hard choice, isn’t it? Right

00:21:29.980 --> 00:21:31.100
A: It should work, or I’ll be in trouble...

00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:32.900
A: Then…

00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:34.400
A: Another attack!

00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:36.840
A: Stop it!

00:21:37.180 --> 00:21:38.280
A: Just for a moment, please!

00:21:38.820 --> 00:21:41.140
A: Here, let me electrocute you!

00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:43.420
N: Go!

00:21:43.420 --> 00:21:43.920
A: Go!

00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:45.380
A: Go! Give it your best!

00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:48.480
A: I wonder if… this attack works better?

00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:51.700
A: Oh no!

00:21:53.740 --> 00:21:54.800
A: This is really bad!

00:21:58.540 --> 00:22:00.540
A: Only trouble is left!

00:22:01.620 --> 00:22:02.120
A: Hmm!

00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:05.240
A: Trouble here!

00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:09.100
A: Trouble here!

00:22:10.780 --> 00:22:12.020
A: In trouble here!

00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:15.600
A: In trouble here!

00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:19.700
A: Ahhhhhhh!

00:22:19.820 --> 00:22:21.460
A: Though I did my best, this is weird!

00:22:21.460 --> 00:22:22.140
N: *laughs*

00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:24.580
N: Too bad!

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:25.540
A: I resent this!

00:22:26.060 --> 00:22:26.620
A: See you next year!

00:22:27.300 --> 00:22:29.740
N: Man, that was like an eternal dream!

00:22:29.740 --> 00:22:30.280
A: Right?

00:22:30.580 --> 00:22:31.800
N: That was a really long nightmare...

00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:32.440
A: Really long, right?

00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:35.620
N: However for the most part, you're good!

00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:36.180
A: Am I?

00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:36.700
N: Really good!

00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:39.400
A: So I've gotten better and managed to show my cool side...

00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:42.600
N: While using Yaoyorozu’s Three-Thousand World’s attack...

00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:45.600
N: You were able to take Arma’s aggro, and defeat him!

00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:48.600
A: The fight was good, I had no luck...
N: I know, right?

00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:52.680
N: Your luuuuuck… was definitely plentiful, but this was…
A: Damn it!

00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:55.200
A: Next time, I’ll show you me clearing the level...

00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:57.200
N: Your confidence in that has me a bit worried...
A: Why?!

00:22:57.200 --> 00:22:59.980
N: If we made that kind of thing and you didn’t...
A: No way!

00:23:00.180 --> 00:23:02.680
N: If my bosses saw that, they’d be mad!
A: They’ll get mad..?

00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:06.500
N: So please… next time, beat the boss
A: I’ll beat it for sure! Piece of cake!

00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:09.680
N: In this virtual world, Ai-chan should be able to beat it

00:23:09.860 --> 00:23:10.400
A: I'll do it!

00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:14.280
N: I see it you know, your skills at this...
A: Don’t worry, you know, I’ll time leap and...

00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:16.900
A: No matter how many times it takes

00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:18.780
A: I will save those girls!
N: Alright, let’s beat that thing together

00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:23.000
A: Well since I was a cool person today, will I receive a reward today, by any chance?
N: Right, no, well…

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:25.900
N: By the way, you’re doing Union as well, how is that?

00:23:25.900 --> 00:23:28.400
N: I kind of want to know how’s it going..
A: Yes! I’m doing it right now

00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:32.320
A: Everybody’s been trying so hard, so much more than me!
N: Right

00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:34.900
A: Everybody at Union, right?

00:23:34.900 --> 00:23:36.920
A: Everyone is trying really hard!
N: Right

00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:38.560
A: Is really active, you know?

00:23:38.740 --> 00:23:42.680
N: Active, you say?
A: Logging in every single day!
N: Wow, that’s amazing! You must be happy

00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:45.520
N: That’s… something you can talk about, right?
A: I can, right?

00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:48.060
N: Because of Ai-chan, everyone is logging in...

00:23:48.060 --> 00:23:50.900
N: Having lots of fun in the game
A: That’s exactly right

00:23:51.060 --> 00:23:53.060
A: Just by being there...

00:23:53.700 --> 00:23:56.500
A: There’s a HUGE impact!

00:23:56.500 --> 00:23:58.480
A: It sure is hard being popular!

00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:00.900
A: Eh? Hello?

00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:03.280
N: Alrighty then! So let’s wrap things up

00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:03.840
N: *laughs*

00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:06.280
A: Okay!
N: Let’s wrap things up, shall we? So, the next time I...

00:24:06.500 --> 00:24:09.800
N: You welcome me here, it’ll be to do a support song
A: Yes

00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:12.280
A: Of course! It’d be a pleasure! I really look forward to that

00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:13.700
N: Is that okay?
A: Of course!

00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:18.060
A: I can even do a BEB
N: Alright, so let’s look forward to that
A: Yes!
N: And let’s stop with...

00:24:18.220 --> 00:24:21.400
N: The bad dreams too, okay?
A: That was a pretty close call, eh?

00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:22.680
A: Don’t worry, I’ve already awoken from the dream...

00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:23.440
A: Having said that...

00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:25.940
A: This was Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai and...

00:24:26.500 --> 00:24:27.220
N: NoriP here!

00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:29.020
Both: Bye bye!
