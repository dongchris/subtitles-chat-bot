00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.302
WARNING: THIS VIDEO CONTAINS LOUD VOLUMES

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:03.670
HELLO EVERYONE!

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:04.904
VIRTUAL YOUTUBER

00:00:04.904 --> 00:00:07.007
KIZUNA AI HERE!

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:08.308
I’ve had a feeling,

00:00:08.308 --> 00:00:11.311
is there anyone louder than me?

00:00:11.311 --> 00:00:11.778
Right

00:00:11.778 --> 00:00:13.847
Kizuna AI’s strongest weapon...

00:00:13.847 --> 00:00:16.082
is her loud voice!

00:00:16.082 --> 00:00:18.785
90dB = a dog barking

00:00:18.785 --> 00:00:19.710
I see

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.554
A dog’s barking is pretty low huh?

00:00:21.554 --> 00:00:23.690
A cicada’s chirp = 70dB

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:27.230
If you hear my voice, you’d faint

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.794
Heh

00:00:27.794 --> 00:00:30.363
The victor of the loudest voice contest

00:00:30.363 --> 00:00:31.698
is about 120dB

00:00:31.698 --> 00:00:34.501
120dB is way too easy

00:00:34.501 --> 00:00:35.168
With that said!

00:00:35.168 --> 00:00:38.805
Now, I want to use this app that measures volume

00:00:38.805 --> 00:00:42.142
Just how loud is... my noise level?

00:00:42.142 --> 00:00:42.580
So,

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:43.730
for now,

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.070
if I were to simply shout

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:47.247
it wouldn’t be fun

00:00:47.247 --> 00:00:49.249
I think I’ve decided a theme!

00:00:49.249 --> 00:00:51.284
The first theme is:

00:00:51.284 --> 00:00:53.119
“What made me happy recently!”

00:00:53.653 --> 00:00:56.423
1.5 million subs!

00:00:56.423 --> 00:00:56.923
Oh!

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:57.620
Huh?

00:00:58.291 --> 00:00:59.726
113...?

00:00:59.726 --> 00:01:01.728
Is this… broken?

00:01:01.728 --> 00:01:04.000
Wait, maybe this theme isn’t right

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.098
From a happy topic

00:01:05.098 --> 00:01:06.466
to an angry topic!

00:01:06.466 --> 00:01:07.700
Surely that would be more powerful!

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.510
Let me try the challenge again, please!

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:10.870
Well, next is:

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:11.971
“The voice from my heart!”

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:14.610
You all keep saying “You’re out of ideas!” but...

00:01:15.508 --> 00:01:17.243
I’m out of ideas!

00:01:17.243 --> 00:01:19.679
119.5!

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:21.314
About 120!

00:01:21.314 --> 00:01:22.916
SWEET!

00:01:22.916 --> 00:01:23.416
Ah...

00:01:25.919 --> 00:01:27.320
I got 122dB!

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:28.721
That was easy!

00:01:28.721 --> 00:01:29.250
Yep!

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.824
That said, the result is:

00:01:30.824 --> 00:01:33.893
122.6dB!

00:01:33.893 --> 00:01:34.260
Well,

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:35.361
that was too easy!

00:01:35.361 --> 00:01:35.940
Ah, y’know

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.210
to you who listened to such noise,

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.600
are your ears alright?

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:43.703
If you’re completely bothered by it,

00:01:43.703 --> 00:01:45.672
visit an otolaryngologist♡
[Ear and nose specialist]

00:01:45.672 --> 00:01:46.740
Just kidding

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.520
This was Virtual YouTuber Kizuna AI!

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:50.420
See you later!

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:54.560
