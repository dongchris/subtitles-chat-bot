00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.580
Hello everyone! Virtual Youtuber Kizuna Ai here!

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:03.320
Ah!

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:04.160
It's been a while!

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:05.100
It's been a while!

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:06.180
I'm the balloon NoriP!

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:09.000
If NoriP-san appeared, that means that...

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.840
It's about the game Genjuu Keiyaku, Cryptract, right?

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:14.160
You know him now, right?

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.500
It's not the first time he appeared!

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.020
The reactions I got were incredible...

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:17.640
Really?

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:18.800
They said I turned into a balloon..

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:19.980
Yaaaaaay!

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.620
Let's start from below

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:22.160
*laughs*

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.280
For today, since I thought it'd be sad that you're always alone...

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.020
Ai: Yes, it's very sad..
NoriP: I brought a friend with me

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:28.580
Oh! How nice!

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:30.540
Maybe it's a woman?

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:31.660
NoriP: Let's introduce her at once!
Ai: Oh! Oh!

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:32.620
Who is it? Who is it? Who is it?

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:33.520
Good.. Go ahead!

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:34.420
Good day!

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:35.660
What is this...?

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:36.780
Good day!

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.120
Ai: She's adorable!

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:38.940
It's a pleasure to meet you!

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.060
I always see you, Ai-chan!

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:41.740
My name is Mamiruton and I'm of the company AppBank!

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:42.860
It's a pleasure to meet you

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:44.380
It's Mamiruton-san!

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:45.120
Oooh!

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.340
It's a pleasure to meet you!

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:47.000
It's a pleasure to meet you!

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.440
Eh? You're adorable!

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:50.340
Even though my head is a bit heavy...

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:51.060
*laughs*

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:52.880
My name is Kizuna Ai..

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:54.620
It's a pleasure to meet you!

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:56.820
We do a make a rather strange combination the three of us together, right?

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:58.240
It's surreal..

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:59.440
It's surreal, right?

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:00.200
It's heavy!

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.740
We gathered people from different worlds, right?

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:03.900
It's a pleasure to meet you

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:04.860
NoriP: It's a pleasure
Ai: It's a pleasure

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:05.440
Mamiruton: Excuse me..

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.960
How has it been going with Cryptract? Have you been playing?

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:09.140
I've been playing a lot!

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:14.180
Lately, you haven't been challenging those in which you lose... right?

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:14.860
No!

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:15.940
Well... I've been...

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:16.800
work..

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:17.800
...ing... hard...

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.400
Ai: But I lose, right?
NoriP: Really?

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.780
Mamiruton-san is incredibly strong

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:22.520
No, I wouldn't say...!

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:23.320
*laughs*

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.780
Mamiruton: Really, I wouldn't say something like that...
Ai: I'm in trouble

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.320
But in Mamiruton-chan's case...

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.260
Well...

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:30.720
You've been playing for around a year, right?

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:31.280
It's true

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:32.860
You've been playing a lot...

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.540
No, you make it sound like it's a difficult obstacle..

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.700
You make it sound like it's a difficult obstacle..

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:36.280
My master!

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:37.360
I'm not your master!

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:38.300
*laughs*

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:40.020
I see..

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.020
So then, I'm in trouble?

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.800
NoriP: No, you're not in trouble, but...
Ai: Ah! Good!

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.580
It's just compared to Mamiruton-chan..

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:46.780
NoriP: You still have a lot to improve..
Ai: It's true

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.320
No, of course, yes, ah...

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:49.900
Please make me your disciple!

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.060
Not so much! Not so much!

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.940
I'll work hard!

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:52.820
NoriP: You'll work hard?
Ai: Yes

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.920
In this case, for today, you'll be practicing with Mamiruton-chan...

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.100
NoriP: Will you fight some battles with her?
Ai: Oh!

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:58.860
I'll do it!

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.120
You'll do it? Okay, let's do it then!

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.840
Mamiruton: It's a pleasure!
Ai: It's a pleasure!

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.520
Eh? But it's possible I might win...

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.680
It would be very painful if I beat my master..

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:07.780
*laughs*

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.420
I'm not a big deal, really...

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.340
Ai: No, no, no!

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:11.420
Ai: Wait a sec!

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.080
NoriP: Eh? She behaves like an adult woman
Ai: No, no, no!

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.560
NoriP: Definitely...
Mamiruton: It's not like that!

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.220
NoriP: So Ai-chan is the evil one then...
Mamiruton: No, it's not like that!

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.760
*laughs*

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.320
It's not like that, it's not like that!

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.040
No, no, naturally I'm defective so then, well...

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.860
I'll lose..

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:24.620
Ai: I'll lose
Mamiruton: Wait...

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.040
What do you think? Did I look like a good girl?

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:28.280
*laughs*

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.880
Marvelous

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.100
NoriP: You gave a good impression
Ai: Good!

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:31.240
*laughs*

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.040
Well, you just started so then...

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.540
Yes, yes

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:34.460
I think you still have a long way to go..

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:37.660
For now, I've only been trying my luck with the summons...

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.640
I've been obtaining a lot of characters that I like

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:41.140
How envious

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.700
*laughs*

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:43.440
Ai: Will we receive free characters?
Mamiruton: Will we receive free characters?

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:45.900
NoriP: There doesn't exists gifts in the game
Mamiruton: It doesn't exist

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.000
Ai: It is not planned to be implemented

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.760
Ai: I see

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.240
Good, Ai-chan.. Shall we start?

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:52.000
Yes!

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.820
I'll explain what we'll do...

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:53.720
What will we do?

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.060
The competition consists of two parts

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.660
The first will be a drawing competition with the Tilt Brush program..

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.040
And the second one will be a character summoning competition..

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.080
A Summon competition!

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.660
Finally!

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:02.620
Good, it'll be a piece of cake

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.040
Good, I have experience with Tilt Brush...

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:06.920
So then naturally, I'll be victorious

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.800
I can do it!

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:09.220
Are you good with the program?

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.080
Good.. well...

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:12.020
It's a piece of cake..

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:14.120
You didn't see my video of Mount Fuji, the hawk and the eggplant?

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.640
...

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:15.880
Ah, you didn't see it!

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:16.580
*laughs*

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:17.760
You didn't see it!

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:19.080
You didn't see it!

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.740
Here is the video, everyone look!

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.640
NoriP: We saw it, right?
Mamiruton: We saw it

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:25.700
Mamiruton: It was fun!
NoriP: It was fun

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:26.900
Mamiruton: It was fun!
Ai: Stop lying

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:28.220
*laughs*

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:31.460
Ai: There are adults like that, right?
Mamiruton: I love your "Snack Ai" section

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:33.000
I love you, Mamiruton-san

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.600
Ai: NoriP-san, we'll talk later
Mamiruton: I like your Kansai dialect

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:36.620
*laughs*

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.840
Of course...

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.680
What do I get if I win?

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.440
If you win, then...

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:42.540
You'll get something good

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.460
Oh! Free summoning stones for 500 years?

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:45.420
*laughs*

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:46.760
That's too much!

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.620
I can't give you something like that, but...

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:49.900
It'll be something delicious

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.940
Ai: Something delicious?
NoriP: I'll give you something delicious

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:52.960
But I can't eat..

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:54.980
Well, let's try installing the data

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:56.680
I see, I see..

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:58.300
NoriP: In the case that you lose...
Ai: Yes

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:59.300
You'll have to do a punishment

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:00.160
Ai: Ah!.. Eh?!
Mamiruton: Oh man!

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:01.320
*laughs*

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:03.600
Why do you laugh like that?! You're scaring me!

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.680
At the end of the video, you'll reveal the punishment?

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:06.180
That's right

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:07.220
Mamiruton: At the end of the video..

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:08.580
Watch until the end

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:09.880
I see, I'll try!

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:10.460
I'll try!

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.020
Good, in this case, let's start at once!

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:13.840
Bye bye~

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:14.340
Aahh...

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:17.380
Good, the winner of the Tilt Brush competition will be...

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:22.980
Who draws "Bulb" the best, the monster mascot of Cryptract

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:25.140
Good, now I'll say the rules of the game

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:25.640
Yes

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:26.940
You have 5 minutes to draw

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:28.000
Are you ready?

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:28.580
Yes!

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:29.480
First I should choose...

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:32.800
Eh, really I'm not that good at drawing, so then...

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:33.720
I'll try hard!

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:34.880
Also it's in 3D!

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:35.800
Have you drawn in 3D?

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:36.380
I've never done that!

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:36.880
Here I go

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:37.800
Good, ready!

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:38.520
Start!

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:40.220
I can draw it without much detail, right?

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:41.820
Yes, you can draw however you like

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:42.320
Good

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:45.460
Ah, wait... now...

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:46.580
I don't like the shape!

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:47.480
Eh, this?

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:48.700
Ai: It looks like a meatloaf, right?

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:49.420
*laughs*

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:51.200
I'll do it over

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:53.540
Ai: Good! Keep going!

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:55.120
Is it like this?

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:56.180
Ah, if I do it like this..

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:57.380
The thickness of the pencil...

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:58.880
Ah, I made it too big..

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:00.440
NoriP: What do you think of this, Ai-chan?

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:02.180
Ai: Well...

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:04.500
Ai: I think this is very particular...

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:05.600
Ai: Or that's what I think

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:06.580
*laughs*

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:08.360
Ai: Well, you know, definitely...

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:10.240
Ai: Being it not an ordinary drawing...

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.460
Ai: since it's in 3D..
Mamiruton: Ah, I see!

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:14.320
Ai: So then the drawing has depth, so then..
Mamiruton: It's true

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:16.880
Ai: It'll take a long time drawing it completely...

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:19.480
Ai: But definitely it'd be great that not only it can be seen from the front...

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:23.640
Ai: But I'd like to be able to draw it so that it is seen beautifully at any angle

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:24.420
Mamiruton: I see..

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:25.960
NoriP: You definitely have experience

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:26.620
Ai: That's right
Mamiruton: That's right

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:28.240
I see, you're...

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:30.460
Ai: Please call me Tilt Brush teacher

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:31.260
*laughs*

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:33.260
Ai: Ah, but it's adorable, right?

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:34.860
Mamiruton: It's true, do you like it?

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:36.720
Ai: It doesn't look like the first time you use it

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:37.220
NoriP: It's true

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:38.320
Mamiruton: Really?
Ai: Yes

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:39.780
Ai: It's adorable

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:40.360
Mamiruton: Oh man!

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:41.940
NoriP: I wonder if you've not been practicing yesterday

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:43.320
Ai: It's true!

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:44.760
Ai: Eh? Actually..?
NoriP: Eh?

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:47.060
Ai: Have you been practicing?!

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:49.260
Mamiruton: No, it's my first time, my first time, my first time..

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:51.620
Mamiruton: I'm almost done with the drawing, I still have time, right?
Ai: Now in this moment, well...

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:54.060
Mamiruton: I see, but it's in 3D
Ai: This is what's happening..

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:56.060
Mamiruton: I see, in this case, I'll do this...

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:59.300
Ai: That's right, that's the hardest part
Mamiruton: Make it like a sphere ... I see...

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:01.500
Mamiruton: Ah, actually it looks like a flower if you look at it sideways!

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:04.080
Ai: That's right, this is very hard

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:05.600
Mamiruton: But bit by bit, it's looking worse than before...

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:06.360
*laughs*

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:07.600
Mamiruton: It's not good

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:08.580
NoriP: Now I rememeber

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:10.020
Ai: Ah, but from this angle, it's adorable

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:11.860
Mamiruton: From this angle.. from this angle, it's adorable
Ai: It's adorable!

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:14.800
NoriP: Time's almost up...
Mamiruton: Ah, it can't be, it can't be...

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:17.680
Ai: I now have victory in my hands!

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:18.720
Mamiruton: It can't be!

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:22.260
Mamiruton: Editing this part is very hard..
NoriP: 3 minutes are left to go

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:23.700
Mamiruton: It's hard! It's very hard!

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:26.000
NoriP: 2 minutes and 30 seconds
Ai: This is very difficult

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.600
NoriP: You still have time, right?
Mamiruton: I still have time

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:28.560
Ai: Even though I already won, right?

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:29.660
*laughs*

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:30.900
NoriP: It's a victory in advance!

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:32.980
Mamiruton: Definitely for someone living in a 3D world...

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:36.160
Mamiruton: I think it's a fairly adequate challenge...

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:38.680
Mamiruton: I think this is a pretty big obstacle for me..

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:40.680
Ai: Ah, but it's very adorable

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:41.640
Mamiruton: Really? Although the color...

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:43.440
Mamiruton: I think I messed up with the color!

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:45.420
Mamiruton: But if we see it from this angle...

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:46.780
Ai: Yes, from this angle, it's adorable!

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:47.420
Good job

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:49.320
NoriP: A minute and a half is left

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:51.500
Mamiruton: Ah! But I already finished..

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:52.140
NoriP: Oh!
Ai: Oh!

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:53.280
Mamiruton: That's all

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:54.780
Ai: Oooooh!
NoriP: In this case...

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:58.440
Mamiruton: If I continue drawing, I'll make it worse...
NoriP: Would you rather finish it now even when there is a bit of time left?

00:06:58.440 --> 00:06:59.100
Mamiruton: Yes!

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:00.860
Mamiruton: I'll leave it finished

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:01.700
*Camera shutter sound*

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:05.620
NoriP: Good, next up Ai-chan...
Ai: Yes!

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:06.840
NoriP: Are you excited?

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:08.120
Ai: I'll win

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:09.140
*laughs*

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:12.640
NoriP: Good, you have 5 minutes to draw

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:13.800
Ai: Good, here I go!
NoriP: Ready...

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:14.500
NoriP: Start!

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:15.000
*Ding*

00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:18.240
Ai: Good, first I'll use the mirror function...

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:20.500
Ai: Something like that
NoriP: What's the mirror function?

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:22.800
Ai: Like this
NoriP: It looks like you're used to it, right?

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:23.840
Ai: That's right

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:25.800
Ai: I'm drawing the 3D model

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:26.700
Ai: Like this...

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:28.780
Mamiruton: Eh?
NoriP: That's the mirror function?

00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:29.900
Ai: And now I'll paint!

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:31.660
Ai: I wonder if I can do it

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:32.900
Ai: I haven't done it in a long time..

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:33.420
*laughs*

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:37.000
Ai: How did I change the thickness?
NoriP: You didn't do it Mamilton-san, that of painting

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.020
Mamiruton: Ah, incredible!

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:39.960
Mamiruton: Ah, that's incredible!

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:40.960
Ai: Yes!

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:43.600
Mamiruton: That way it will look like a bulb wherever you look

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:44.700
Ai: That's right

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:45.740
Mamiruton: Eh? It's incredible!

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:46.880
Ai: Satisfied look!

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:49.200
Ai: Eh? I didn't do well since I haven't done it in a long time..

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:51.040
Ai: Ah, this doesn't look good..

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:51.800
Ai: It doesn't look good..

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:52.960
*laughs*

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:53.680
Ai: What is this?

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:55.520
Ai: I'll start over..

00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:57.080
Ai: I need to undo one by one...?

00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:00.320
Ai: I DON'T HAVE TIME TO BE DOING THIS!

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:01.100
*laughs*

00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:04.220
NoriP: Eh? What did you try to show us with that drawing?

00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:07.160
Ai: Well, I wanted to show you the mirror functionality..

00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:09.740
NoriP: You wanted to show us that function?
Ai: Yes

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:13.560
Ai: It's very difficult, isn't it Mamiruton-san?
Mamiruton: It's difficult, right?

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:14.440
Ai: That's right

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:19.220
Mamiruton: I think it would be better if we surrendered and instead of drawing in 3D, we draw in 2D..

00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:20.340
Ai: And this way...

00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:21.820
Mamiruton: Ah, incredible but...!
NoriP: Oh!

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:23.620
Mamiruton: It's looking like a bulb..
Ai: Good, good

00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:24.440
Mamiruton: Eh? Incredible!

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:26.320
Ai: What is this supposed to be? Trash?

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:29.160
Ai: I made trash again..

00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:31.860
Ai: I'm in trouble, I'll lose... and now?

00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:33.400
Ai: But you know...

00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:35.160
Ai: Well... starting from now...

00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:36.980
Ai: From now...

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:37.860
Ai: This!

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:39.040
Ai: Fire!

00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:39.640
Mamiruton: Eh?

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:41.180
Mamiruton: Fire?

00:08:41.180 --> 00:08:42.180
NoriP: What is...? What is...?

00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:42.980
NoriP: Oh!
Mamiruton: Eh? Eh?

00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:44.640
Ai: This way.. this way...
Mamiruton: What is that?

00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:46.060
Mamiruton: Eh? Incredible..

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:47.800
Ai: I'm drawing those that bulbs have...

00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:50.040
Mamiruton: Ah, it's the fire they throw!
Ai: This...

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:50.720
Ai: That's right!

00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:51.380
Ai: What do you think?

00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:52.740
Mamiruton: It's incredible!
Ai: I won now, right?

00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:54.280
Mamiruton: I didn't know that function existed

00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:56.480
Ai: And now I'll draw the eyes...

00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:57.940
Ai: Chun, chun..

00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:00.180
Ai: I'll draw the eyes...
Mamiruton: Ah, it's adorable

00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:00.680
Ai: Oh!

00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:01.300
Ai: And now...

00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:02.580
Ai: Quickly!

00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:04.340
Mamiruton: There's still 2 minutes left

00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:04.940
Ai: Oh, no!

00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:06.920
Ai: I'm in trouble!

00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:08.240
Ai: Maybe did it absorb the color?

00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:09.540
Ai: It didn't absorb it!

00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:11.640
Ai: Let's go, let's go!

00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:12.680
Mamiruton: It can absorb color?

00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:13.960
Mamiruton: Ah, to fill in the rest

00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:14.800
Mamiruton: Eeeh?

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:15.460
Ai: That's right

00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:16.520
Mamiruton: I see..

00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:18.740
Ai: Oh, no!

00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:20.080
Ai: Oh, no!

00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:20.640
*inhales*

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:21.840
Ai: Save me!

00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:24.580
Mamiruton: It's a new species of bulb..

00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:25.920
*laughs*

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.480
Ai: Please make one look like this!

00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:29.720
Ai: Make it appear!

00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:30.820
Ai: A little bit more...

00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:31.800
NoriP: A new species of Bulb

00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:32.640
*laughs*

00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:33.800
Ai: It's special!

00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:36.680
Ai: If you eat one of these, you raise up to your max level

00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:37.240
*laughs*

00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:39.180
Mamiruton: I'd like to have one..

00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:40.400
NoriP: There's only a minute left

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:42.080
Mamiruton: Ah, but she's painting it

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:43.200
Ai: I messed up the color!
Mamiruton: It looks incredible

00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:44.480
Ai: I messed up the color..

00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:45.520
Ai: Whatever...

00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:47.140
Ai: I guess that's fine

00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:48.440
NoriP: Let's see the back, please

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:48.960
Ai: Yes!

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:49.800
Ai: The back part..

00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:52.240
NoriP: Oh, but...! But...!
Mamiruton: Oh, incredible!

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:54.020
Mamiruton: It looks great from whichever angle...
NoriP: It's done in 3D, right?

00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:54.960
Ai: Thank you very much

00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:57.500
Ai: Good, I finished!

00:09:57.620 --> 00:09:59.000
Ai: GHAN GHAN GHAN!

00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:04.400
NoriP: Well, then we will competing for 10 character summons!

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:06.320
Ai: Yaaaay! I'll win, I'll win!
Mamiruton: Summoning! I love the summons!

00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:07.720
Ai: You like it cause you have good luck, right?

00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:08.660
Ai: You have good luck, right?

00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:13.160
NoriP: In this competition, both will do summonings of 10 characters...

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:15.740
NoriP: And who obtains the best characters is the winner

00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:16.300
Mamiruton: Good
Ai: I see

00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:17.320
NoriP: Do you have confidence in yourself?

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:18.300
Ai: For nothing...

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:19.380
*laughs*

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:21.600
Ai: Ah, you knew?

00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:25.300
Ai: I can never get a shiny character..

00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:26.300
Mamiruton: Eeeeeh?

00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:28.440
Ai: That's why even if personally I wanted to get...

00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:32.000
Ai: Well, Elizabeth-chan... although I want to obtain her

00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:36.320
Ai: I feel that shiny characters hate me so I have no confidence that I can do it, but...

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:37.420
Ai: Regardless, I'll win!

00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:38.580
*laughs*

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:41.600
NoriP: Good, let's start, who will be first?

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:42.840
Ai: Me! Me! Me! Me!

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:43.760
Ai: Me!

00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:44.660
Ai: Me! Professor!

00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:45.600
NoriP: Good
Ai: Me!

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:46.880
NoriP: Good, Mamiruton-san...

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:47.380
Ai: Eh?

00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:49.020
*laughs*

00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:50.740
NoriP: I'm joking, I'm joking..

00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:52.580
NoriP: You start, Ai-chan
Ai: Ah, good, good..

00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:53.440
Ai: Good, here I go!

00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:54.340
Ai: Appear!

00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:57.940
Ai: Mamiruton-san, do you do something before the summonings to attract luck?

00:10:57.940 --> 00:10:59.420
Mamiruton: I make the summonings during the night...

00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:02.440
Mamiruton: Although I say that now, I can't do it..

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:04.080
Ai: I'll cast a charm

00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:07.300
Ai: Little by little, you are appearing...

00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:10.580
Ai: Elizabeth-chan is appearing a bit!

00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:12.180
Ai: Appearing! Appearing! Appearing!

00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:14.360
Mamiruton: Eh? But it's rainbow colored, in that case...

00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:15.260
Ai: Yes!

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:16.840
Ai: Ah!
Mamiruton: Oh! It's rainbow colored!
NoriP: Oh!

00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:18.580

Ai: Aaaah!
Mamiruton: Aaaah!

00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:24.280
Ai: Ah, I wanted one more!
Mamiruton: Will one more appear? Ah, no...

00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:29.000
Ai: Aaaaaah! Incredible!
NoriP: Ooooohh!
Mamiruton: Aaaah!

00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:30.400

Ai: Incredible!

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:38.660
Ai: I'm really happy!
Mamiruton: It's the only...

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:39.740
NoriP: She's shiny...

00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:42.140
Ai: My wish was fulfilled! I managed to get a shiny one!

00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:43.000
Ai: Wow!

00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:44.900
Mamiruton: You obtained Elizabeth-chan just as you announced it!

00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:45.940
Ai: It was incredible, right?

00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:47.440
Mamiruton: It was incredible
NoriP: She's of divine rank, right?

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:48.200

Ai: She's adorable, she's wearing a wedding dress!
Mamiruton: It's incredible

00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:53.600
Mamiruton: She's adorable

00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:57.680
Ai: Now that it's June, that's why she's wearing the wedding dress, right?

00:11:58.180 --> 00:12:00.080
Ai: "The oath of the bride" Will it be an oath with me?
*Reading the skill name*

00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:02.240
*laughs*

00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:04.280
Ai: Why do you laugh like that?

00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:06.900
Ai: Oh, she's strong against demons!

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:08.760
Ai: And against marine enemies..

00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:10.760
Mamiruton: Eh? She's very strong, she can defeat two different types easily

00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:11.880
Mamiruton: She's great! How great!

00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:14.020
Mamiruton: How envious!
NoriP: She's great, how envious!
Ai: It's great, right?

00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:14.900
Ai: Man, I already...

00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:15.760
Ai: Won, right?

00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:18.300
Ai: I have the habit of...

00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:20.300
Ai: Can I listen to her voice when she takes a hit?

00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:20.800
"Ah!"

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:22.980
Ai: Ah, she's adorable!

00:12:23.540 --> 00:12:26.380
"Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!"

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:28.200
Ai: Good!
Mamiruton: You hear it many times!

00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:29.360
Ai: That's right

00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:30.800
Ai: Good, go ahead!

00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:32.560
NoriP: Good, Mamiruton-chan, it's your turn

00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:33.960
Mamiruton: Good, now I'll follow..

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:36.600
Mamiruton: I also want to get Elizabeth-chan just like Ai-chan did!

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:37.800
Ai: Try it if you can...

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:38.940
Ah! *laughs*

00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:40.660
Mamiruton: You're very provoking!

00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:41.180
Mamiruton: Here I go!

00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:42.580
Rainbow!

00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:44.420
Mamiruton: Shine with the color of the rainbow!

00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:48.840
Mamiruton: Let's go!

00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:51.640
Mamiruton: Ah, it can't be! It's golden! It can't be!

00:12:51.740 --> 00:12:52.400
Mamiruton: But...

00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:54.480
Mamiruton: I still have hope..

00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:59.120
Mamiruton: Appear... Ah, she didn't appear! It can't be!

00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:00.320
Mamiruton: This is...

00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:01.260
Aaah!

00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:04.860
NoriP: She succeeded

00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:06.100
Mamiruton: She won

00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:07.920
Mamiruton: She won!

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:09.640
NoriP: Man, what do you think Ai-chan?

00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:11.200
Ai: Well, you know...

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:12.540
Ai: I already won

00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:15.560
Mamiruton: It was fun
NoriP: It was fun!
Ai: Yes, it was fun!

00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:19.180
Ai: It's the first time someone comes and competes with me in this way..

00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:20.700
Mamiruton: Ah, really?
NoriP: Ah, it's true

00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:22.000
Ai: I had a lot of fun!

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.860
Ai: Besides, it's the first time a woman comes here

00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:25.740
Mamiruton: Oh man! I'm the first?

00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:26.520
Ai: You're the first!

00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:27.500
Mamilton: I'm your first!

00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:28.760
Ai: You're the first!

00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:31.940
NoriP: Well, now it's time to announce the winner?

00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:33.100
Mamiruton: I don't want to hear it!

00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:35.100
NoriP: Weell, the winner is...!

00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:36.940
NoriP: Ai-chan!

00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:38.120
Yaaay!

00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:41.420
Ai: I didn't expect anything else, if I had lost I would say it was fixed

00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:46.080
NoriP: You've definitely done a good job of 3D drawing with the Tilt Brush

00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:49.900
Ai: It's true ... well, well, well, leaving aside that my first drawing was garbage...

00:13:50.540 --> 00:13:53.440
Ai: You said I'd get something great if I won, right?

00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:54.500
NoriP: It's true
Ai: Yes!

00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:56.940
NoriP: Well, I'll prepare something ... I'll think of something

00:13:56.940 --> 00:13:58.180
Ai: I'll wait anxiously!

00:13:58.180 --> 00:14:01.260
NoriP: In this case, we should decide the punishment for the loser...

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:02.520
Ai: It's true!

00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:04.120
Mamiruton: I'm waiting for the punishment!

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:07.280
NoriP: Well, since Ai-chan won...
Mamiruton: Yes!

00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:08.800
NoriP: The punishment will be...
Mamiruton: Aaaah, I'm scared!

00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:10.000
Mamiruton: What will it be?
Ai: Ho, ho, ho... *evil laugh*

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:11.060
NoriP: In this occasion...

00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:11.560
Ai: Yes
Mamiruton: Yes

00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:12.400
NoriP: Well...

00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:14.600
NoriP: "Unions" exist in Cryptract

00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:15.100
Ai: Yes!
Mamiruton: Yes!

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:17.860
NoriP: Mamiruton-san needs to join Ai-chan's Union

00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:19.880
Ai: Ooooh! Oh! I'll be very powerful!

00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:20.980
Ai: Woow! Eh?

00:14:20.980 --> 00:14:22.120
Ai: You'll enter my Union?

00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:24.900
Mamiruton: Eh? On the contrary, it'll be an honor for me

00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:25.920
Ai: Ah, wow!

00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:28.040
Mamiruton: Well... you know... you're like...

00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:29.440
Mamiruton: My master!

00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:31.860
Ai: Wow, suddenly, I changed from disciple to master

00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:32.900
*laughs*

00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:34.420
Mamiruton: You're not my master?
Ai: I managed to surpass her!

00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:35.920
Ai: I managed to surpass her

00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:37.420
Mamiruton: Master! I count on you!

00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:38.640
Ai: Good, good

00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:39.900
Ai: Don't worry

00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:43.240
Ai: Well, I'm glad you'll join my Union, but...

00:14:43.460 --> 00:14:46.440
Ai: You know, in order to enter my Union ... you must prove a talent..

00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:47.060
Mamiruton: A talent?

00:14:47.060 --> 00:14:51.220
Ai: That is to say that being of lower rank, if you don't make an imitation or something particular, you'll not be able to enter...

00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:56.240
Ai: So then Mamiruton-kun... well, I can't let you in just like that so...

00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:56.820
Mamiruton: I should say a joke or an imitation..

00:14:56.820 --> 00:14:57.920
Ai: That's right, can you do it?

00:14:57.920 --> 00:14:59.880
Mamiruton: It's like a kind of test to get in, right?
Ai: That's right

00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:00.740
Mamiruton: Good, here I go

00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:03.360
Mamiruton: I'm Anpanman!

00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:06.720
*laughs*

00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:07.640
NoriP: That's...

00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:09.140
Ai: That was horrible..

00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:10.080
*laughs*

00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:11.180
*inhales*

00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:11.920
Well..

00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:14.620
Ai: Well, anyway, the intent is what counts... Ah, do you want to try again?
Mamiruton: Ah, one more time, one...

00:15:14.620 --> 00:15:15.600
Ai: Oh! Oh! Oh!
Mamiruton: One more time

00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:18.320
Mamiruton: I...

00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:21.320
Mamiruton: .. want to eat pudding
*Makes an imitation of characters from the anime 'Ojarumaru'*

00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:22.700
Mamiruton: Ojarumaru-sama...

00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:25.860
Mamiruton: Didn't you just eat fresh pudding?

00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:27.320
Mamiruton: Aha...

00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:28.020
*laughs*

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:30.280
Ai: Oh! You did a great imitation of Denbo!

00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:32.260
Ai: Didn't she seem a lot like Denbo?

00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:34.620
NoriP: She looked like it, right?
Ai: She looked like it, right?

00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:36.940
Ai: She seemed a lot like Denbo...
Mamiruton: I haven't done it in a long time...

00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:39.020
Mamiruton: My throat dried up and I couldn't continue...
Ai: You're incredible!

00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:40.640
Ai: No, definitely...

00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:41.460
Mamiruton: Did I approve?

00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:43.580
Ai: Ah, well, Anpanman was something...

00:15:43.740 --> 00:15:44.260
*laughs*

00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:46.760
Ai: Anpanman and Ojarumaru were absurd, but...

00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:47.720
*laughs*

00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:49.280
Ai: But Denbo was...

00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:50.800
Mamiruton: Denbo was... Denbo was good..

00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:51.960
Mamiruton: Thank you very much
NoriP: Denbo passed the test

00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:53.080
Ai: Denbo passed the test

00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:54.900
Ai: Good, I count on you from now on!
Mamiruton: I count on you!

00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:57.460
Mamiruton: Good, you did a good job
Ai: You did a good job

00:15:57.480 --> 00:15:57.980
*THUD*

00:15:58.700 --> 00:16:01.100
Ai: This was Virtual Youtuber Kizuna-

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:02.360
Ai: Eh? What short arms...

00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:03.400
Ai: Ah! Eh? Eh?

00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:04.580
Ai: I'm over here!

00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:05.480

Mamiruton: Ah!

00:16:06.820 --> 00:16:07.960
Mamiruton: I turned into Ai-chan!

00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:09.300
Ai: Maybe...

00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:10.420
Ai: We both...
Mamiruton: We both..

00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:12.540
