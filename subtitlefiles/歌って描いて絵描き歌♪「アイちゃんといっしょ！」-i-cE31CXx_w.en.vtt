00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.600
It's your Virtual Youtuber~

00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:03.180
Big Sister Ai~! 
(Ai-oneesan)

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:04.200
Now then..

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:05.680
Let's get on with today's-

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:06.960
"Drawing together with Ai-chan

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.960
for the first time!"

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:10.960
The game we're playing together today is

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:12.140
"Sing &amp; Draw!"

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.260
Does everyone know about "Sing &amp; Draw"?

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:16.860
Altogether you sing,

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.360
and draw out a picture -

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.120
It's a fun &amp; enjoyable game!

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:21.000
But..

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.140
Ai-oneesan is not going to play the normal "Sing &amp; Draw"!

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:26.140
For this time..

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.500
Ai-oneesan will look at a picture

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.360
then improvise a song for this "Sing &amp; Draw"

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:33.540
Everyone will listen to hints in the song

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.380
and try to draw out what I'm singing!

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:37.380
Can you draw it out correctly?~

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.440
Let's Sing &amp; Draw!

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.020
So then, firstly..

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:42.440
Ai-oneesan is going to-

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.440
-look at a picture for a drawing subject!

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:48.680
Oh~! So that's how it is!

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.920
We can do this one, can't we?

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:52.540
Al~right!

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:53.820
Now then, everyone will..

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.220
-, according Ai-oneesan's singing,

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:57.740
-try to draw out the picture, ok?

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.200
Very well then, "Draw &amp; Sing" start!

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:03.700
A soybean~

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.080
One of it~

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:06.680
Just dropped down~

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:07.940
Another one~

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:09.060
Rolling rolling~

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.640
Mr. Soybean~

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:12.100
And then~

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:13.080
Eye comes out~

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.720
Nyukki~!

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.140
Nyukki~!

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:17.400
After Nyukki Nyukki~

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.000
A balloon~

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.000
Came out~

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.000
A soul came out~ 
*quick correction*

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:25.860
Candy too~

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.440
Shining shiny~

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:28.960
Another one~

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:30.500
Shiny Shiny~

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:32.220
From there~

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.460
I just drew a rainbow~

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.960
Yo~

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:37.300
A pink colour~

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:39.620
 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:42.200
Is falling down~

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.920
Two of them~!

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:44.860
Fell down~

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.420
Pero-pero candy is coming down too~

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.240
Rolling~ Rolling~

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.080
It's completed~

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:54.960
Also~

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.560
In the meantime~

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:58.980
Did everyone draw it out nicely?

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.680
Do you know what's in the picture?

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.080
Anyways~

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:04.660
The correct answer is!

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.660
A snail~!

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:08.400
Did everyone manage understand it?

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:11.100
For being correct - Congratulations!!!

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.940
Awesome!

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:13.620
Even if you've got this right,

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:14.840
-there's a next one!

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.580
Since having the experience of failure is

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.980
-a big part of life you'll have to get used to!

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:21.220
Well then~

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:22.580
Following up - question No.2!

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.820
Next is..

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.600
I'll choose the song's genre

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.060
then sing with the genre's style in this "Sing &amp; Draw"

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.160
Can you do it nicely?~

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.800
Onee-san's becoming anxious~

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:35.100
But.. but!

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:36.920
I'll do my best for everyone's sake!

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.600
First I'll pick out a drawing subject~

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.560
This is kind of a hard topic..

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:47.560
Well but!..

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:48.720
Everyone leave this to me!

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.720
The intelligent super A.I.-

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:51.880
Ai-oneechan.

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:52.860
- If you leave it to me!

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.800
No matter what kind of "Sing &amp; Draw" it is, I'll be able to do it all!

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.700
Following that is..

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.820
-choosing the song genre~

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:02.940
Enka!
(Old Traditional Song in Japan)

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:04.560
Well-well-well

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.620
This too..

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.540
Ai-oneesan will get this drawn out no problem~

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:10.780
So then, let's draw together everyone!

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:12.840
Let's start!

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.060
Umbrella's~

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.060
Coming out~

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:25.860
A frilly~

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:27.840
Umbrella is~

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.060
Coming out~

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.660
YooooooOO~

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:35.720
From the umbrella~

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:37.980
Drips of water~

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.640
Are dripping down~

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:42.960
A bread roll~

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:45.980
A bread roll had an umbrella

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.160
-sticked into it~

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:51.900
A bread roll has a mold~

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:54.920
Growing on it~
*totally out of tune* xD

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:56.640
A fist~

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:58.360
A bread roll had another~

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:02.580
Mold growing on it~

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:04.580
Sort of~

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:10.040
A boomerang's growing out of it too~

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:12.160
Wonder why?~

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:15.560
Scissor's growing out of it too~

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:17.600
Again &amp; again~

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:20.960
A boomerang's growing out of it~

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:26.640
A sesame seed is stuck on it~

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:28.860
Is this~

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:30.540
A properly done~

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:33.220
Enka?~

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:35.460
Ok!

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:40.000
And in the meantime~

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:42.940
Did everyone draw it correctly?

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:43.720
Eh?

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:45.060
That wasn't an Enka?

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.260
Now now, let's not mind that.

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:48.600
With that said~

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.360
The correct answer is~

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:52.420
It's was a whale~!

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:53.880
Did everyone understand it?

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.340
I think it was pretty easy to understand, but~
*which part of it?!*

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:57.320
How was it?

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:59.340
If you're correct then congratulations!

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:00.840
While unfortunately..

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:02.840
The one who got it wrong - you there!

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:06.120
Accept the failure, then keep on trying-

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.960
-I'm sure you'll become a splendid adult in future!

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:10.460
Alright then!

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:12.180
Continuing with Question No.3!

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:14.940
Next one too - I'll choose the song's genre

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:18.080
According to the genre, I'll be singing with it's style on this "Sing &amp; Draw"!

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:19.160
Firstly,

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:21.160
I'll choose the topic's picture~

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:25.940
This one huh?

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:26.820
Oh everyone~

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:28.820
Will surely be able to understand~

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:30.640
For this one, everyone will surely win!

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:31.520
It'll be fine~

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:32.400
Believe me!

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:33.560
The ones who got it wrong! - You too!

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:34.620
Do your best in it!

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:35.740
On the following!

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:37.740
I'm going to be choosing a genre!

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:41.500
Rap!

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:43.140
Hey~ Yo~

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:43.900
Check it out~

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:46.960
Ok. Let's do this.

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:48.020
Rap.

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:49.560
Please leave it to me.

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:50.280
Well then~

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:52.660
Song's topic's "Rap"

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:55.560
"Sing &amp; Draw" - Start!

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:56.580

Has a~

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:04.760
Hula Hoop~

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:05.260
Yo~

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:07.780
After which~

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:09.880
From Hula hoop's horizontal sides~

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:11.520
On the sides~

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:13.980
A small hula hoop's been made~

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:15.620
Two of them's been made~

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:16.920
Hey~ Yo~

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:19.920
After that~

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:21.420
From the Hula loop~

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:24.040
That.. coming down from it~

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:25.480
It's that~

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:27.040
Is a feet~

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:27.820
Coming down~

Hey~ Check it out~!

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:30.080
Yo~

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:31.700
Yo~

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:34.440

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:35.820
Of foot's~

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:36.980
Growing~

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:37.760
Out~

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:38.520
Hey~ Yo~!

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:41.660
And then from the hula hoop~

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:44.020
Sprou-

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:45.380
Sprout's~

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:46.380
Coming out~

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:47.920
Hey~ Yo~

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:50.440
In the hula hoop~

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:52.500
There's two stones~

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:53.840
That fell inside~

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:54.480
Yo~

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:55.780
Hey~ Yo~

00:06:58.640 --> 00:06:59.740
That stone~

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:01.740
Is like being connected~

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:03.280
It's a non-licking~

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:04.460
Earthworm's come out~

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:04.960
Yo~

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:05.760
Hey~ Yo~

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:07.380
Yo~

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:08.140
Check it out~

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:11.720
And in the meantime~?

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:14.520
Did everyone draw it correctly?

00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:17.800
I thought this is surely easy to understand but..

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:19.020
How was it?

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:21.300
Did you understand what drawing is it?

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:24.080
Well then, go ahead and look at the correct answer!

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:26.160
Anyways~

00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:27.420
Correct answer is~

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:30.620
Me! - Ai-oneechan~!

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:32.780
Did everyone manage to understand it?

00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:35.600
Congratulations to you if you've gotten it right!

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:39.100
Unfortunately for you - the one who's incorrect!

00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:42.900
Life - Not giving up is crucial!

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:44.260
Ok!

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:45.560
Now that it's over,

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:47.100
-how did everyone do?

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:50.100
Ai-oneesan's improvised "Sing &amp; Draw"!

00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:53.640
I Really! Enjoyed it!

00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:56.520
Did everyone have fun?

00:07:57.380 --> 00:07:59.960
Seems like it's time for me to go,

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:01.960
-this is goodbye for today.

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:03.720
It's going to feel lonely~

00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:06.300
Let's play together with everyone again next time ok?

00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:07.520
Will you come and see me?

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:08.680
Well then, everyone!

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:11.280
Quickly get your homework done properly!

00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:13.260
After finishing your dinner,

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.260
make sure to properly brush your teeth!

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:16.760
And then..

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:18.760
Before you sleep, be sure to-

00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:21.380
watch A.I. channel before you do~
