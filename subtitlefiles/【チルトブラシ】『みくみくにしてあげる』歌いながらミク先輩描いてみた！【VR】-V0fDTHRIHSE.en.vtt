That’s impossible! Impossible! It’s just that...

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.100
Look at this! Look at this!

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.120

*Song: Miku Miku Ni Shite Ageru

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.000
Doesn’t Miku-senpai look like this?

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.400
What about her hair?

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.920
Look, Miku-senpai, those are your twin-tails

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.820
As long as she has twin-tails, she’ll become Miku-senpai, right?

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.180
You can see it, like this...

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:42.240
Look...

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:43.860
I’ll paint her a bit

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:44.500
Good, good

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:46.180
Good, good

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:58.720
Like this, Miku-senpai?

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.360
What do you think? Are you happy?

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:02.200
Her feet too...

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:10.180
I’ll make her shine

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:11.600
After all...

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.780

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:19.040
What do you think?

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.000

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:27.320

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:30.960

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:34.160

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:45.500

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.200
I’d like to place my headband on Miku-senpai

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.020
It’s done! Yaaaay! I finished!

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:53.540
Man, please look

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.480
We could match with the headband

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.280
I’m sure that it’ll make her happy

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:58.740
Man, as expected no less of me

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:59.400
Having said that...

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.820
Congratulations Miku-senpai for your 10th Anniversary!

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:08.300
