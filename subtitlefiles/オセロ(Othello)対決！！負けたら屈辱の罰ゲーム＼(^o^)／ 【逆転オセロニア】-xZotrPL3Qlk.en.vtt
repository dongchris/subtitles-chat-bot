00:00:00.055 --> 00:00:02.715
Hello Everyone! Virtual YouTuber, Kizuna Ai here.

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:06.220
Recently, in Chess, Go, Shogi and Othello

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:08.960
The strength of AI has been showcased, right?

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:10.320
That news is pretty talked about, right?

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:13.500
Yeah...I'm much stronger than a lot of the majority of humanity

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:14.545
so...

00:00:14.545 --> 00:00:17.775
Well...I am kind of...well..not kind of

00:00:17.775 --> 00:00:20.155
I am an AI, right? which means...

00:00:20.155 --> 00:00:23.355
I should be stronger than the majority of the humanity right?

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:26.595
So today, of course I would like to prove that to you guys

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.260
Today, I got something for you guys.

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:32.400
I have found a wonderful game to share with you guys..JA JAN

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.620
Reversi! Othellonia!

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.560
Choose your comrades.

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.620
There are quite a lot of choices..1.2.3.4.5

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.480
Test out your capability to your individual comrades!

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.975
With this, you can probably decide your first character

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.440
You can also skip this and choose it yourself..but well, why not try it

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.860
"Q1. Even you have done a good deed, you wouldn't speak out to others.."

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:55.900
Well, I would totally tell others about it..

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.160
cuz I have such strong personalities..

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:02.920
"Q2. You make decisions based on your instincts" Yep!

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:02.720
"Do you go with your gut?"
 Yes I do...

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.560
"Do you act your age?"

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.120
"Q3. Do you act your age" Hmm, yeah I guess so.

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:07.140
I guess so.

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:08.660
I don't age after all.

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.620
Since I don't age.

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:10.120
"Q4. Are you a very stubborn person?"

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.960
I have had experiences where I am told to be stubborn.

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.035
"Q5. Do you have interest in others?" Oh! I do! well, in all the humans

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.600
out there, I'm very interested in them.

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:22.260
"Q6. Before doing something, would you think of the impact that it will have?"

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:23.880
Let's choose "yes".

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.220
"Q7. If you were sure you made the right judgement,

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.760
even if others disagree, you would not back down."

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:39.260
No!

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.020
"Are you motivated to make the world better?"
Nope.

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.680
"Q9. Have you every cried due to someone else's misfortune?"

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.800
"Q10. Instead of listening to others,

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.800
you'd rather talk about yourself." *clicks yes*

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.140
Well, I have to fix this...

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.660
Oh!

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.880
"You have the power of a kind heart!"

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:56.660
"You are proud of the strength of your kind heart"

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:58.440
The unsung hero

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.080
"The type with a hidden power." That sounds more like me.

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.120
Wow, I'd like you to flatter me a little more.

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:03.220
Wait...this...

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:04.960
This is a bit...

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:08.720
AH!

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.480
I turned out to be Meitis-chan

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.015
Really, a cute girl for a cute girl is the way it should be.

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.020
And so, without caring about the rest, I pick Mettise.

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:17.980
I'll choose meitis-chan!

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.800
Lilia gatcha. I want power straight away!

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.380
I'll do the gacha for immediate power.

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:21.920
Cute girl!

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:22.020
A cute one.

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:24.620
As long as they are cute it doesn't matter!

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.480
If she is cute, I don't care!

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.680
This is important to my motivation

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:26.640
I'll get my motivation from that.

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:27.740
Let's go.

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:27.560
Here we go

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:30.560
Go!

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:30.140
Heya!

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.660
Cute girl...cute girl...

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:37.560
A cute one.

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.560
AH!

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:43.900
Platinum!

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:43.880
Platium...Platium color!!

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:44.720
AHHHH!

00:02:45.235 --> 00:02:46.975
Feels good!

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:46.680
Good! Good!

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:48.120
So cute..

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:48.220
Cute!

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:49.720
(Character: I am Isis.)

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.760
Isis-tan
*my name is Isis*

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:50.220
Isis!

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.120
(Character: I don't like fighting.)

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.380
Oh you dislike it....
*I hate conflicts*

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.300
You don't like it?

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.640
(Character: I'll do my best to support you.)

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:57.220
*I will try my best to work for you*

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.260
An obedient girl, huh.

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.060
An obedient girl, huh?

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.460
Ok, everyone, now I'll show you my luck

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.040
Ok, everyone, from here's I'll show you my luck -

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:03.860
Ah, not that.

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.060
Ah, not that -

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:05.940
To show you my luck,

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.700
My luck - I'm hoping for a godly pull!

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.780
I'm looking for a godly pull.

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.700
Let's try it!

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:09.940
Let's try it!

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.060
Onscreen: If the gems falling in are rainbow coloured, there is an S class character.

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:13.960
(Onscreen: If the gem is rainbow coloured, it means an S class character)

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:18.920
Go!

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:18.820
Go!

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.960
How's that?

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.060
How's that?

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.040
The colour is changing too.

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.380
The colour is changing too - Ah!

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:26.600
Feels good!

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:26.420
Feeling good!

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.140
One!

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:31.100
One!

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:33.700
One!

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:33.320
One!?

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:34.920
But I got it!

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:35.140
But I got one!

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:37.400
Ah! She's cute.

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:37.720
Ah, cute.

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:38.740
Cute.

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:39.080
Cute.

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.540
Super Divine!

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.420
Super divine!

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:43.420
Cute!

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:43.360
Cute!

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:47.080
Ah, she's cute too.

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:47.260
Ah, she's cute.

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:49.080
Her too.

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:48.920
Ah, cute.

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.120
Ah, she has wings, cute.

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:51.720
Ah, she has wings, cute.

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:53.980
Cute!

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:54.140
Cute!

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.080
Cu-u-u-te.

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:57.280
Cu-u-u-te.

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:59.000
Ah, she is...

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.180
Ah, she is...

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:02.480
(Character: Rest easy.)

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:03.320
Ohh...

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:05.860
Giant titties!

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.640
(Character: I'll protect you for sure.)

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:10.880
Aurora-chan, so cute!

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:13.660
For 3 turns, when placed on the table,

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:14.480
Ah~!

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.520
The damage is reduced to 40%.

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:21.500
She also has a combo skill 1.7x damage.

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:23.160
She looks strong!

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:27.320
Cute and Strong!

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:28.740
This little one is...?

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:36.400
It converts the nearby 3 tiles to a random enhancement.

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:38.980
The maximum one is...

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:42.780
The one in the top left of this board.. right?

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:44.020
EHH..

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:44.640
[S]... is..

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:45.480
This

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:47.720
Isn't this Aurora-chan?

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:49.720
How is this possible?

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:51.340
Well, then

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:53.500
My superior and pretty...

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:55.180
...divine God....

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:56.820
...Party!

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:58.260
So,

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:00.500
I think we should start battling but,

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:03.560
Well, as I said before, seeing as I'm an A.I.

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:04.900
this should be a piece of cake

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:06.380
that's why

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:09.060
in the 1-10000+ chance that I'll lose

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:12.960
I'll do a punishment game

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:14.540
Is what I was thinking

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:17.320
What punishment game would be good?

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:23.640
I got a lot of comments saying to do that game

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:26.340
To do the punishment game: Sing a song!

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:30.120
I'll use Othellonia background music ...

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:33.740
to try and sing a sexy song

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:35.300
that's only if I lose though

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:37.300
since it'll only happen if I lose

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:38.820
don't anticipate it too much

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.840
Now let's go, and try it!

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:43.180
Let's try a class match.

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:47.180
Ah, mine's way cuter than that.

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:49.220
Survive!

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:54.840
First, I'll...

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:57.060
choose this one

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:07.460
Doesn't this look more like a Normal Stage?

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:10.020
it should feel more like a class match

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:15.200
Ha, I took your castle!

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:27.360
If I put it here, it should have a lot more attack power

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:30.180
Combo skill!

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:35.180
Look.

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:36.720
Look!

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:42.720
I'm so full of Combo skill!

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:46.960
Look at that!

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:48.900
Oh, that looks pretty good!

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:52.440
It's time to use another Combo Skill.

00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:58.640
it's a pretty good match

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:02.100
but Fuuka is a support character so

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:04.900
I can turn the situation around using this ability!

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:06.300
First I'll do this

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:10.220
No?

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:11.620
ah he survived

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:12.600
Okay.

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:15.640
"Hey, are you okay?"

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:17.320
I've already won right

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:20.040
whatcha think of that

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:22.680
*evil laugh*

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:23.560
Here I go.

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:25.840
Here I go with my attack!

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:28.800
And with this the outcome is settled

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:35.900
Okay! That was easy!

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:44.860
Meh, the opponent is pretty weak, guys.

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:47.640
It just proves that I'm a great A.I.

00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:49.420
even though I ended up winning

00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:52.720
I feel good because I got good characters and I did win, so ...

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:54.200
I'll sing now!

00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:01.840
Aurora, Capella

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:04.860
*something something gibberish*

00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:06.040
Methis

00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:07.440
Water...

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:07.980
 

00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:09.800
Narcleps...

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:11.320
Dragon and newt...

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:13.120
tututtu undine

00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:19.560
Who thought of this Punishment Game!?

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:20.660
COME OUT-

00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:22.660
Othellonia.

00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:24.860
so how was that?

00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:26.880
I'm pretty strong!

00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:28.980
you've been able to see my good points

00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:31.340
and that was Reversi/Othello

00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:33.460
And actually

00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:35.200
there's a TV commercial running now!

00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:38.340
there's a newbie help campaign running now too

00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:41.920
first, you can get a guaranteed S class character immediately

00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:51.380
and for all users without an s class character, you can get one from the pool, including limited time characters

00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:53.580
and also

00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:59.700
S+ characters come with their level maxed, skill maxed, and combo skill's level

00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:02.935
All of it all of it, MAXED.

00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:04.860
You can play with strong characters right from the start

00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:06.320
Isn't that really enticing?

00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:09.100
You can beat em all up right from the start!

00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:09.900
Not only that,

00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:13.980
You can choose your favourite attribute from Divine, Devil, and Dragon!

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.100
In other words,

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:19.540
You are guaranteed to get characters you can use immediately!

00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:21.020
But not only that!

00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:26.000
Everyone can obtain a lot of star fragments form login bonuses and the campaign!

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:27.960
First time players can,

00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:28.700
listen to this,

00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:34.060
can receive up to 250 star fragments, enough for 55 characters!

00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:35.020
I'm so jealous!

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:36.840
How generous!

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:37.960
Returning players,

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:41.140
or people who are currently playing like me,

00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:44.040
can receive up to 100 star fragments!

00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:44.640
GENEROUS!

00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:45.680
THANK YOU VERY MUCH!

00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:47.080
Besides that,

00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:50.860
There are many campaigns to help beginners so

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:52.020
If you're going to start playing

00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:53.260
now is your chance!

00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:54.020
And you know,

00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:57.600
it's just so happens to be Golden Week right now...

00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:59.600
If you're going to stay at home anyway,

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:01.320
Why not try playing Othellonia!

00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:03.840
Well then, let's meet again in the world of Othellonia!

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:05.360
Bye bye!
