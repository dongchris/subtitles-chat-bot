Hello everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna AI here!

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:04.571
Recently, I was able to do...

00:00:04.571 --> 00:00:06.206
...A collab...

00:00:06.206 --> 00:00:08.375
...With the famous Horiemon-san!

00:00:08.375 --> 00:00:10.076
Yaaaaay!

00:00:10.076 --> 00:00:11.378
Horiemon-san...

00:00:11.378 --> 00:00:13.079
...He’s also a YouTuber

00:00:13.079 --> 00:00:13.980
And it turns out that...

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:14.814
...He did...

00:00:14.814 --> 00:00:15.949
...A collab...

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:17.550
...With HIKAKIN-san!

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:18.985
That's what it seems!

00:00:18.985 --> 00:00:20.420
How envious!

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:22.055
I also want to do it!

00:00:22.055 --> 00:00:23.556
I’ll be showing you...

00:00:23.556 --> 00:00:24.591
...A bit...

00:00:24.591 --> 00:00:25.558
...Of the collab that I did!

00:00:25.558 --> 00:00:26.326
In that case...

00:00:26.326 --> 00:00:27.660
...Onward...

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.429
...With the videotape!

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:30.430
Horie: Yes
Woman: Regarding this...

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:31.431
W: AI-chan...

00:00:31.431 --> 00:00:33.833
W: ...You have a question, right?

00:00:33.833 --> 00:00:34.801
AI: Yes!
Horie: Really?

00:00:34.801 --> 00:00:35.368
AI: Horie-san

00:00:35.368 --> 00:00:36.970
AI: You're known for being...

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:37.937
AI: ...A hard worker

00:00:37.937 --> 00:00:39.773
AI: You try to do a lot of things

00:00:39.773 --> 00:00:42.008
AI: Where do you get your motivation...?

00:00:42.008 --> 00:00:43.010
AI: ...To be such a hard worker?

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.977
H: Ah, well...

00:00:43.977 --> 00:00:46.279
H: ...Everyone will probably say that work...

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.913
H: ...Well...

00:00:46.913 --> 00:00:47.881
H: ...It's to earn money...

00:00:47.881 --> 00:00:49.349
H: ...And they do jobs that they don't like...

00:00:49.349 --> 00:00:50.350
H: ...That's what I think

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:51.384
H: In my case...

00:00:51.384 --> 00:00:53.053
H: ...I only work with what I enjoy, so then...

00:00:53.053 --> 00:00:54.900
AI: Ah, same as me!

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:55.553
H: It's true

00:00:55.553 --> 00:00:57.757
AI: Definitely when you do what you like...

00:00:57.757 --> 00:00:59.359
AI: ...You don't feel that sensation...

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:01.127
AI: ...That you're working, right?
H: It's true

00:01:01.127 --> 00:01:02.062
AI: I see
H: It's because of that...

00:01:02.062 --> 00:01:03.396
H: ...At the start, well...

00:01:03.396 --> 00:01:06.066
H: ...It wasn’t that 100% of the things that I did, I liked but...

00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:07.760
H: ...Bit by bit, that percentage...

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.235
H: ...Well, the things I didn't like...

00:01:09.235 --> 00:01:11.538
H: ...I was reducing them little by little...

00:01:11.538 --> 00:01:12.505
H: ...Until they almost disappeared

00:01:12.505 --> 00:01:14.140
H: I’m having fun today as well

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:14.760
AI: Ah!

00:01:15.308 --> 00:01:15.909
AI: Yay!

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:17.243
AI: That makes me very happy

00:01:17.243 --> 00:01:19.112
AI: Can I ask you one more thing?
H: Yes

00:01:19.112 --> 00:01:19.746
AI: When you work...

00:01:19.746 --> 00:01:20.413
AI: ...Little by little...

00:01:20.413 --> 00:01:22.015
AI: ...You save money, right?

00:01:22.015 --> 00:01:24.551
AI: If you have a lot of money

00:01:24.551 --> 00:01:25.585
AI: For example, if your life were...

00:01:25.585 --> 00:01:26.719
AI: ...To end in a month

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:27.720
AI: If that were to occur

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.640
AI: Would you use the money for something extravagant?
H: No...

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:30.957
H: In reality, I have nothing

00:01:30.957 --> 00:01:31.691
H: When we talk about money...

00:01:31.691 --> 00:01:33.526
H: ...The idea that everyone has about money is...

00:01:33.526 --> 00:01:34.227
H: ...Probably...

00:01:34.227 --> 00:01:36.727
H: ...The cash, but...
AI: Aaahh...

00:01:36.727 --> 00:01:38.191
H: The money balance...

00:01:38.191 --> 00:01:39.265
H: ...Hasn't changed a lot...

00:01:39.265 --> 00:01:40.533
H: ...All these years

00:01:40.533 --> 00:01:44.671
H: Normally I invest it or waste it
AI: Mmm... Ah!

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.820
H: So then I’d only have cash for a month

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:48.840
AI: I see!

00:01:48.842 --> 00:01:49.843
AI: It's a relief to hear that

00:01:49.843 --> 00:01:50.477
AI: To be able...

00:01:50.477 --> 00:01:51.811
AI: ...To connect with a lot of people...

00:01:51.811 --> 00:01:52.745
AI: ...I plan to work...

00:01:52.745 --> 00:01:53.313
AI: ...A lot

00:01:53.313 --> 00:01:53.980
H: Please do your best

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:55.215
AI: Yes! I’ll work hard!

00:01:55.215 --> 00:01:56.683
Doesn't it seem incredible?

00:01:56.683 --> 00:01:57.450
He's...

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.385
...Really someone very, very important, right?

00:01:59.385 --> 00:02:00.520
Definitely...

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.722
...Everyone wants to meet...

00:02:02.722 --> 00:02:04.724
...this extremely beautiful young girl, right?

00:02:04.724 --> 00:02:06.826
Well, a lot of things happened, but...

00:02:06.826 --> 00:02:07.760
...To tell you the truth...

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:08.695
There's still a lot more left

00:02:08.695 --> 00:02:10.396
In the video that I’ll be uploading tomorrow...

00:02:10.396 --> 00:02:11.297
...It turns out that...

00:02:11.297 --> 00:02:11.831
It-it-it turns out...

00:02:11.831 --> 00:02:12.565
It-it-it turns out...

00:02:12.565 --> 00:02:13.766
Horiemon-san will be...

00:02:13.766 --> 00:02:14.400
...In this...

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.102
...White space

00:02:16.102 --> 00:02:17.270
It turns out that...!

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:18.571
Whoops

00:02:18.571 --> 00:02:19.739
If I say anything more...

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:21.374
...I’ll ruin the surprise, so then...

00:02:21.374 --> 00:02:22.342
...Please make sure to be attentive...

00:02:22.342 --> 00:02:23.576
...In tomorrow's video!

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.600
