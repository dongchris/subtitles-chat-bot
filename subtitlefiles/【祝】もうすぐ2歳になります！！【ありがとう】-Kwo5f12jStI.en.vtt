00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:20.090
That’s right!

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:21.255
Kicking it off today,

00:00:21.255 --> 00:00:22.823
I have a very important announcement to make!

00:00:22.823 --> 00:00:24.660
I’ve been mentioning it a lot

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.240
at recent events

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:27.928
and on Twitter as well,

00:00:27.928 --> 00:00:28.795
so I think there may be

00:00:28.795 --> 00:00:30.998
some of you who will say, “I already know about this!”

00:00:30.998 --> 00:00:32.210
but, coming all too soon,

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:33.867

00:00:33.867 --> 00:00:35.910
I will be holding

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.540
my Birthday Event!

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:39.172
Ya~y!

00:00:39.172 --> 00:00:40.000

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.774
starting from today,

00:00:40.774 --> 00:00:42.540

work that day”

00:00:50.551 --> 00:00:51.685
“I won’t be able to get the tickets~”

00:00:51.685 --> 00:00:52.386
“I’ve got lessons”

00:00:52.386 --> 00:00:53.720
“I’ve got school”, you complain,

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:54.755
