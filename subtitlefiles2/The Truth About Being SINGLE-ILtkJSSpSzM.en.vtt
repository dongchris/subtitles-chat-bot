00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:12.580
I love you.

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.040
I love you.

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:15.200
I love you.

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:16.680
-I love you.
-I love you.

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:18.200
I love the way you make me feel.

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:19.300
You make me feel like,

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:20.600
anything is possible.

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:22.660
You always make me happy,

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:24.100
And you show me things that,

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:25.480
I could have never imagined.

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:27.800
You and I, we just... fit.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.180
You know what I want,

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:30.760
and I always know what you need.

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:32.380
It's all the little things.

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:34.160
You've got a beautiful sole.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.400
You could just be cheesy sometimes,

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.100
-I love it.
-I would stand in...

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.780
rainstorms and blizzards
just to be with you.

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.700
You didn't always look this good.

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:44.160
What I mean isâ€“

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.920
After all these years
you just keep getting better and better.

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:49.340
You're so hot,

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.540
You make me look good.

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.100
And I'm super selfish,
I always want you to myself.

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.080
When things get difficult,

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:56.680
I love that we can always start over.

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:58.240
I love that there's two of you,

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:03.200
and I will never crease you!

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:05.220
I love how you feel in my hands.

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:07.800
and that you're Bluetooth-enabled.

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.400
There's always something new with you,

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.820
and I love that you have no commercials.

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.940
I love how you make
all my problems go away.

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.880
[gulp]

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.400
I love how you make
all my problems go away.

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:22.900
Wait, did I already say that?

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.080
I love that you're only a phone call away.

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.280
And only $6.99 on Wednesdays?!

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:31.980
[gulps]

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.660
Ah...

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:35.820
[door bell]

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:39.400
Pepperoni pizza?

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:41.800
Uh... yeah.

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:43.920
So, uh...

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:46.300
you eatin' alone tonight?

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:48.300
Well I...

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.640
guess I am missing a little bit of,
heat, now aren't I?

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.340
You have any of those chili flakes?
You know, the ones in the packets?

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.940
Yeah!

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.900
Thanks!

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:02.400
Bye!

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:05.420
Hey.

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.240
So are we still gonna
go out tonight or what?

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:09.600
Megan, no!

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:11.200
Why?

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:15.700
Every time...

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:17.860
Hey everyone!

Tell us in the comments what you're
in love with this Valentines' Day.

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:21.800
Hopefully, it's alive.

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:23.480
Enjoy the bloopers!

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:26.200
Ah I just wanna eat you up.
I just wanna eat you!

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.260
You're so hot, I just wanna eat you up.

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.100
-And you're so instant.
-[text message chimes]

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:32.300
Like that text message.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.360
-It was instant text message.
-[giggles]

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.700
Sometimes people call you a square but,

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.800
-I just think you're more of a triangle.
