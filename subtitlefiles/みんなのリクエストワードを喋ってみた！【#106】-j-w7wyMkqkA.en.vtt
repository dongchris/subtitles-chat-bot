Hey there, Virtual Youtuber Kizuna Ai here.

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:11.080
Everyone, today I'll be saying some lines as requested on Twitter, and in past videos!

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:16.820
You all requested quite a lot. Lots of different things.

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.020
I'll be giving it my all! Enjoy!

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:21.540
Let's go!

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:22.660
Pen name: Yura.

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.940
Ah I see, this one will be easy.

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:26.980
Let's go!

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.400
Ah, onii-chan, that's my favourite pudding!

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:33.940
The phantom queen pudding!

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:35.900
It's pretty rare, right?

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:37.980
Right? you have to line up for a week, right?

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.280
You lined up for me?

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:41.580
In the cold?

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.840
In survival circumstances?

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:44.840
Thankyou!

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:46.360
I love you, onii-chan!

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.800
Stay with me forever, ok?

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:50.520
I love you, onii-chan!

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:52.620
Stay with me forever, ok?

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:53.840
How embarassing!

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:54.540
Onii-chan...

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:55.920
Next!

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.140
Ah, I see. This is cool.
Onscreen: Cool-sounding lines like you'd see in a manga

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:02.340
I can think of a few.

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.680
The dungeon, Shinjuku!

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.120
I want to go to the East exit!

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.060
Where is it?

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:11.440
It's ok.

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:13.620
Shinjuku is like my backyard.

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:14.620
Come with me.

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.900
Shinjuku is like my backyard.

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.180
Come with me.

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.560
Last is.. this!

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.180
Pen name: Carlitos.

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.120
I see. This is cool too.
Onscreen: Cool lines like you'd hear in a movie

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:25.100
I've decided! Let's go!

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.960
*virtually dodging*

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
You'll never hit me with mere bullets!

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:29.940
*attempts to virtually dodge*

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:30.680
*ded*

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:32.640
Wh-what is this?

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.760
*Mercy Q*

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:36.640
Helden sterben nicht

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.000
How was that?

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.700
This time, I got lots of requests, so

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.440
I'm going to reply in a medley!

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.180
I wonder if I'll get to yours?

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:47.720
Look forward to it!

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.060
Let's go!

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.860
Rikka-san! "Order me to do something, master!"

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:52.540
Kalpacho!

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.560
Unprecedented horror!

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:56.860
The transcendentally angry

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.240
Virtual Youtuber!

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:00.520
The lover of Youtube!

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:04.040
The girl who was banned from Youtube!

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.000
Yes! Me!

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.640
VIRTUAL YOUTUBER

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.180
KI! ZU! NA!

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:11.500
A! I!

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.840
YAY!

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.100
JUSTICE!

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:16.140
Iku-san!

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.080
A. Wake Tomeko-san!

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.580
Damn, the enemy's attacks are too strong!

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:25.720
Hey newbie! Ammo!

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.040
You, bring me some ammo! Here! Hurry up!

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.580
Shit, I'm hit.

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.380
It looks like I'm done...

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.240
Harumichi-oniisan!

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.260
*virtual motorbike noises*

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:36.120
Old man!

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.820
I'm feeling more and more like eating those rice seeds!

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.700
Filth will be cleansed!

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:43.980
Yflether-san!

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.600
Raw wheat, raw rice, raw ginger! (tongue twister)

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:46.720
Metal-eater-san!

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.420
Tokyo! Patent! Governing body! (another tongue twister)

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.960
Ok!

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:49.920
Omame-san!

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:56.980
My shoulders were stiff so I bought a shoulder massage machine. It was difficult. (The way this is phrased is super difficult to pronounce properly)

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:58.100
Got it!

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:59.320
Toast-san!

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.000
What's up with that? It's really cool!

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.800
Nemu-san

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.620
You're not allowed to stop

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:05.840
until I tell you to!

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.980

Those were a loooot of lines

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:36.480
I caught everybody's originality

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:37.920
and it was a lot of fun

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.280
I’d like to make these well known, so

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.500
I was thinking, what lines would everybody

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:43.620
come up with

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:44.160
and it made me happy

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.680
And that was the Virtual YouTuber, Kizuna Ai!

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:47.440
