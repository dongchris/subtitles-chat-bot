00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.260
[rooster voices]

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:05.980
Everyone, Happy New Year.

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:07.940
Virtual Youtuber,
Kizuna Ai here!

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:09.720
Looking forward for your support for this year too!

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:10.880
I'll get to the point here,

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:12.800
did you went hatsumōde this year? [1]

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.340
Since I'm virtual,

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.680
I thought I couldn't do things like hatsumōde but..

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:17.660
When I looked it up,

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:20.680
I found a shrine where I can go hatsumōde!

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:21.260
Ta-da!

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:22.240
Sakura-Jingu Shrine

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.280
With this, you protector of the house [2]

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:25.760
while protecting your house,

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:27.160
you can go hatsumōde at the same time!

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:27.960
In reality,

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.900
it's placed at Setagaya-ku in Tokyo, Japan;

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:31.400
But!

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:33.920
You can come to visit the shrine on the internet!

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:34.760
So, let's go

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:36.060
visit the shrine!

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:39.020
If you visit Sakura Jingu website,

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:40.540
If you click this "Internet worship-from-afar" button,

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:41.740
you can pray at the shrine.

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:42.580
By the way,

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:43.480
"Worship-from-afar" is

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.820
doing your prayers while facing 
where the shrine is in real life

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:50.400
You can see the layout of the shrine, huh

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.200
Right now apparently I'm near the gate,

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.280
about here?

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.600
Before you enter the gate,

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:57.840
first you need to do salutation

00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:59.260
since it seems to be a good omen.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:00:59.860
Also,

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:02.060
The middle passage way is a road for the gods,

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.360
Let's imagine we're walking on the right lane.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.640
"Proceed to next step"

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:07.640
It seems to be the main shrine!

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:09.340
Let's go and pray.

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.400
While the usual way to pray is
"Two worship, two claps, one worship",

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.440
depends on the shrine, it could be different!

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.000
In Sakura-Jingu Shrine,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.520
the usual way to worship/pray here is
"Two worship, 4 claps, one worship"

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:20.540
So I'll do as suggested then!

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:25.320
[This is the "two worship" part]

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.480
[This is the "4 claps" part]

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.580
[This is the last worship part]

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:35.440
[this is also the part where you make your wish]

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.180
"I wish I get New Year Money for this year"

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.100
[and this is the salutation after the prayers]

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:46.120
Incidentally,

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:47.160
the donation box

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:49.980
accepts donation by bank transfers!

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.440
I'm going to send some too after this!

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.920
Oh, a registry book!

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.640
I'm going to write my name here too!

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.000
"Becoming famous

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.500
and able to connect with many people!"

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:01.580
"Watchword"?

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:03.720
"Register"

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.600
There's omikuji too, you know?

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:06.960
I've always wanted to pull this.

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.540
I'm born in June so,

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:10.520
June!

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:12.480
[The result is "Luck"]

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:12.980
I see

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:14.000
It's like this:

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:15.000
[The result in good means, in descending order is:
Great Luck &gt; Luck &gt; Middle Luck &gt; Small Luck &gt; No Luck &gt; Bad Luck

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.460
It goes from "good luck" and downwards!

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:20.340
Aah!

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:21.780
I get to write on "Ema" too! [3]

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.280
Awesome! Let's go write one!

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.280
The category of my ema..

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:28.380
"Relationship Fortune"

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.840
And for the wish content...

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.560
Okay!

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.760
"Get to meet a lot of people

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:34.960
and be friendly with them!"

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.000
The watch-word is "to pray", okay.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.060
It's perfect!

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.860
Hmm?

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:40.800
Charms!

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.260
Seems like I can get one, you know?

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:43.540
It's a chicken!

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.880
This is..

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.820
"Prayer for school success"

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:48.840
"Relationship Fortune"

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:50.680
By the way,

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.560
you can put this charm on to your website!

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.600
I'm going to put one up in my website so 
please come and visit later, okay?

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:57.540
Alright!

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.600
We've done our first hatsumōde! Yay!

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.000
With this, 2017 will be

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.720
awesome, don't you think?

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.220
And it seems I'll have good fortune this year!

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.680
Although I visited the shrine online,

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.860
if you can visit Sakura-Jingu Shrine in person,

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.860
please go visit the shrine and 
tell me your thoughts about it!

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:13.020
Let's all visit and

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:14.660
make this year a great year!

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:15.720
Bye-bye!
