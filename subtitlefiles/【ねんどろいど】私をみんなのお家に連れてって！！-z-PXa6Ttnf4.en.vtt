Hello everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna AI here!

00:00:40.466 --> 00:00:42.300

is now available to preorder!

00:00:44.566 --> 00:00:45.866
Ya~y!

00:00:45.866 --> 00:00:47.333
Who was waiting for this?

00:00:47.333 --> 00:00:48.620
Ye~s!

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.933
I was the one

00:00:49.933 --> 00:00:51.533
who was waiting for this the most!

00:00:51.533 --> 00:00:53.266
The images you saw earlier

00:00:53.266 --> 00:00:54.700
were taken for us

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.400
by the Good Smile Company!

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:57.966
Thank you very much!

00:00:57.966 --> 00:00:59.200
So what do you think?

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.866
Isn’t it so~ cute?

00:01:01.866 --> 00:01:02.833
First of all,

00:01:02.833 --> 00:01:05.766
the expressions are so alike to my own!

00:01:05.766 --> 00:01:07.800
I know that for sure!

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.633
Only as expected of Good Smile Company

00:01:09.633 --> 00:01:10.266
LOVE💛

00:01:10.266 --> 00:01:11.560
It has been a long journey

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.433
to get this far

00:01:13.433 --> 00:01:14.510
What started this all

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:15.600
was a video!

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.733
I released a video saying,

00:01:16.733 --> 00:01:18.766
“I want a figure of me!”

00:01:18.766 --> 00:01:20.666
And then many different things happened

00:01:20.666 --> 00:01:23.666
including being invited to meetings with the directors of the company like Kahotan

00:01:23.666 --> 00:01:24.833
Or, really, inviting myself

00:01:24.833 --> 00:01:28.020
I asked them “Please make me into a figure somehow!”

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.966
And they let me distribute merchandise at the Winter Comiket

00:01:30.966 --> 00:01:33.420
and because of all your support, buying my merchandise,

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.440
finally

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:35.300
finally!

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.660
My Nendoroid figure was completed

00:01:38.666 --> 00:01:41.366
and it’s finally available to preorder!

00:01:41.366 --> 00:01:43.000
I am truly so grateful!

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.266
Thank you very much!

00:01:44.266 --> 00:01:44.960
And...!

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:46.340
Bam!

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.600
It has such quality!

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.466
Even when I’m this tiny, I’m so cute~

00:01:52.466 --> 00:01:53.833
Everyone~!

00:01:53.833 --> 00:01:55.233
Do you want

00:01:55.233 --> 00:01:57.833
my Nendoroid~?

00:01:57.833 --> 00:02:00.066
Do you want it~?

00:02:00.066 --> 00:02:02.233

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.233
So then,

00:02:08.233 --> 00:02:09.666
my Nendoroid,

00:02:09.666 --> 00:02:10.533
after popular demand,

00:02:10.533 --> 00:02:12.166
is now available to preorder!

00:02:12.166 --> 00:02:13.266
“Ah~h…”

00:02:13.266 --> 00:02:16.700
“Won’t my lovely AI-chan come to me in my room?”

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.200
“Even if only once”

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.266
“I want to touch the all-too-beautiful Kizuna AI~!”

00:02:22.266 --> 00:02:23.000
“Lord AI!”

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.666
“Please bestow to me your presence!”

00:02:26.666 --> 00:02:28.500
