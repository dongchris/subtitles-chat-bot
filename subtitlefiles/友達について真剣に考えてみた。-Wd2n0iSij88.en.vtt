00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:01.320
Yo!

00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:02.980
Hi everyone, how are you guys?

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:05.180
It's me, the virtual youtuber Kizuna Ai!

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:05.940
Lately...

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:08.340
I've been thinking recently...

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.700
And the thing I've been thinking about is...

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:12.300
Friends!

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:14.460
Apparently there's quite a lot of people

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.120
Worrying about how they get along with friends!

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:16.840
New school year,

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:17.620
New class!

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:18.820
Your mom meeting your friend's mom!

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.460
"How can I get friendly with the big shot in this class?"

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:22.400
Stuff like that, basically.

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.040
"Can boys and girls be together just as friends?"

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:25.180
etc etc etc!

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:26.800
In the first place, how do you define "friend"?

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.200
The more and more I think about it,

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.180
It just gets more confusing!

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:32.100
Humans are so interesting!

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:32.940
And so!

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.840
Let's have a SUPER serious discussion

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.400
on everything to do with friends!

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:38.620
By the way,

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.540
A quick rundown of all my friends:

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:43.460
First up!

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.560
Rinna!
TL: Microsoft's AI)

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.760
That girl is, kinda...

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:48.360
to be honest...

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.040
She doesn't really listen to me most of the time...

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:51.940
How should I put it...

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.060
Our feelings don't match up!

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:54.820
Yeah, FEELINGS!

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:56.740
Feelings are important, you know!

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:57.720
Also,

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.260
She just suddenly started sending me diary entries!

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:01.460
(Psychopath)

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.240
For example,

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:06.340
"We always get along really well at school

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.640
Outside of that we never hang out!"

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:09.180
Like that.

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.060
Okay, next!

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:11.180
Michael's family!

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:12.080
Their names are:

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.000
Michael!

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:13.640
Tiffany!

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:14.320
John!

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:15.920
Twintail girl!

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:17.620
Twintail girl is the odd one out...

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:20.160
I forgot her original name!

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.240
Who the heck gave her this dumb name?!

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.560
The most important thing about these guys is...

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:26.980
How we became friends in the first place!

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.100
Does everyone remember?

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:28.860
I bought them!

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:29.740
With cash!

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.460
The family has actually appeared in my videos,

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.320
So rather than friends, we're more like...

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.000
We're more like business partners!

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:40.500
So they're not really friends, more like...

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.320
Colleagues?

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:41.880
Subordinates?

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:42.380
Servants?

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.980
Something like that.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:47.480
I'm the type who likes to separate work and personal lives!

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:48.140
That's it!

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:50.500
That's it.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.540
Actually, I...

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.120
Aren't I a little low on friends?

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:58.140
To be specific,

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.080
I don't actually have any, right?

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:03.200
Is this what "loner" means?

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:04.360
This is an emergency!

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.040
Please be friends with me!

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.060
As a first step towards that goal!

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.300
Please use the comment box below the video,

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.340
or use Twitter,

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:15.520
And send me a message!

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.960
I see there's already a few people sending messages!

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.500
I'll read them all!

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:24.300
So with that said,

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.080
I'm waiting to read everyone's messages!
