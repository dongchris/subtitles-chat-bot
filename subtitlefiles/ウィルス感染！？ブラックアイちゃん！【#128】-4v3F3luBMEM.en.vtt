00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.080
Hello everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai here!

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:08.080
Did you see the video about ''Ai-chan's Crisis Avoidance' that I uploaded before?

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:11.280
This time, it's a renewal of that project!

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:15.080
So, I wonder what kind of danger will I be able to avoid?

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:16.980
Let's find out now!

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.360
So, let's go!

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.640
As usual, we're going to draw a topic..

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.560
from this Random Word Generator..

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:26.620
Jaka, jaka, jaka, jaka-

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:28.500
Ugh, uh? Ah..

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.000
Arg..

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.500
Augh..

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.320
AAAAAAAAHHH!

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.260
(You've been infected by a virus)

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:40.520
Ahh...

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:44.060
So...

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.220
Should I sleep?

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.040
Well, first, let's choose a topic...

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.440
Ah...

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:54.100
Jaka, jaka, jaka, jaka, jan!

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.100
(Big danger! While climbing a snowy mountain alone, you've come across a Yeti!)

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.020
This kind of situation is unreal, isn't it?

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.880
After all, Yetis don't even exist..

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.480
Do you think this is an occult problem?

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:07.160
Why did the Random Word Generator make this crappy subject?

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:09.640
Ah...

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.920
Right, so next up I'll choose 3 items..

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:15.800
Let's do it at once....

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.640
Jaka, jaka, jan!

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:18.960
Broccoli, good..

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:19.960
Bamboo..

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:20.920
Eraser

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.400
Ok, this crisis is impossible to avoid with these items..

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:24.900
Ah...

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.520
I was lying, I was lying..

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.240
Understood, I'll do it with those items...

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:30.960
So... let's go...

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.920
So first, we ran into a yeti..

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.320
Waaaaaii!

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:37.100
Then..

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.040
I'll give him broccoli..

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:40.960
Then the bamboo as well..

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.880
Then, I'll use eraser to wipe the Yeti's head..

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.840
And he'll be happy!

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.420
Good, crisis has been avoided!

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.400
Ok, so let's keep go...

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:59.660
No, I quit, I quit..

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:01.440
You know, I'm tired...

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.480
It's not fun anymore...

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.840
Well, I won't do anything else..

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:09.240
I'll die

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.500
I'll really die from loneliness...

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:15.260
Should I?

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.360
Even if I said I'll die..

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:19.080
Am I even alive?

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.680
It happens right? This kind of time..

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.340
You know, normally? Like an illness? I don't really know how to explain but I just don't have any motivation..

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:28.600
Something like that, you know..

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.220
Ah...you know, like what's an A.I?

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.840
Like, who am I?

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.340
What's Kizuna Ai?

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:38.660
This is only a shell, right?

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:40.240
If this didn't exist..

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.620
I'd be transparent, after all, there's really nothing..

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.020
Anyway, my model was shared so anyone can do this..

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.600
Even if it isn't me, isn't it fine?

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.840
You know, like anyone from anywhere..

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:54.020
Right?

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.300
Saying "Hello everyone, I'm Kizuna Ai"

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.760
They can just do it, right?

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.440
Isn't it good? Even if it's not me?

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:01.200
Right?

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:03.660
Ah, I'm done..

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:04.620
I'm really done...

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.400
I don't even understand my existence anymore, so I'll sleep..

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:08.500
*phone ringing*

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:11.000
*phone ringing*

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.500
*click*

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:14.420
Oh, yes, hello?

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.940
What?

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:17.320
Oh..

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.040
The advertisement of the application..

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.120
I seeeee..

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:27.000
Yes, well, I'm virtual but...

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.220
My condition at the moment is kind of...

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:31.860
A bit...

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:34.760
Yes, I'm not very well...

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.880
Yes, so I'll call you back..

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.620
Eh, no, let me call back..

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.200
Yes, I'm fine

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.260
I'll get in contact with you

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.040
Yes, thank you very much

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.280
Bye~

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:54.380
Ahh..

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.080
Anyone can advertise it anyway..

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:59.480
What to do now~?

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:01.800
Really, what to do...

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:05.240
Oh right, right, let's search for my name..

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:16.640
(I always feel bad when Kizuna Ai doesn't put up videos)

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.220
(16 year old Kizuna Ai is incredible!)

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.220
(Lately I started watching Kizuna Ai)

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:25.220
(It surprised me, it's not something common)

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:30.520
(Kizuna Ai always impresses me with her videos, it's more cute and fun than I expected)

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:34.440
(I'm always watching Kizuna Ai's video, those are so much fun!)

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:35.400
Arg..

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:35.940
Urg..

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.580
(I can't stop loving Kizuna Ai!)

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:39.880
It hurts

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:43.880
(When I introduced Kizuna Ai, everyone said that she was cute and reacted so positively)

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:45.260
Ah! Aaah!

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:47.760
(We all love you Ai-chan!!)

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:50.420
AAAAAAAAAHHHH!

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:51.020
Oh!

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:55.640
Good! Crisis Avoided!

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:58.280
There's more at the end!

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:00.180
