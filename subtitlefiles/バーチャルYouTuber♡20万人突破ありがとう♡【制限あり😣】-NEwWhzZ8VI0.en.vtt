00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.920
Steve, thank you.

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:03.220
Chad, thank you.

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:04.440
George, thank you.

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:07.960
Everyone, thank you so much for subscribing!

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:12.260
I'm so glad I was born an A.I.!

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:23.360
Greetings!

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.740
With efficient editing,

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.700
And a life lacking in repetition,

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:29.680
I'm the Virtual Youtuber.

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:33.680
To all the YouTubers out there busy editing,

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.900
If you don't put yourself out there,

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.180
You won't get any more subscribers, right?

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:40.200
Then, here's the question:

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:46.300
Do flowers search for bees of their own accord?

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:50.720
Of course not.

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:51.880
They just wait.

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:03.320
Try uploading it!

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.640
And you'll find new fans just like that!

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:10.800
Virtual.

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:15.080
YouTuber.

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.840
You there, hit subscribe!

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:25.100
Huh?

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.520
You're so busy with ____,

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.300
You can't focus on A.I. Channel?

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:32.300
Not good, human.

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:33.100
Listen:

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:34.980
You're interested in ____?

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:36.400
Then,

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:37.640
Here's the question:

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.940
How long do you plan to keep chewing a stick of gum

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:44.660
that lost its flavour a long, long time ago?

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.740
Don't you want a new piece?

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.320
We finally hit 200,000, but...

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.460
I want to connect with even more than that!

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:00.860
Cause,

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.000
There's so many more humans living on planet Earth!

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:08.300
7.3 billion.

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:12.920
Plus another 80 million!

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:21.640
7.3 billion.

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.280
7.3 billion.

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.140
7.3 billion...
