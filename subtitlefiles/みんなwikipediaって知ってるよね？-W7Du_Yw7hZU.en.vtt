00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.940
Hey there!

00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:02.820
Virtual Youtuber,
Kizuna Ai here!

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:04.940
Do you know about
'Wikipedia'?

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:06.360
No way there's anyone who
doesn't know about that~

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:07.840
If I were to explain it simply,

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:09.740
It has a huge collection of

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:11.960
internet encyclopedia, right?

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.260
Isn't it very useful for people doing 
their reports or assignments?

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:16.480
So I think,

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.080
since my channel subscriber has grown quite a lot,

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:20.600
"I should have my own page"

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.160
as I thought and tried to look it up

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.960
and it turns out...

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:23.820
there isn't one.

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:25.100
My wikipedia page.

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:29.680
"So there's something not on Wikipedia..."

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:31.100
I felt something like that.

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:31.740
And so,

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.740
I thought of making one myself,

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:36.740
but apparently you can't make one for your own.

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:38.220
But this means,

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:41.180
people who wants to know more
about me will be troubled, right?

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:42.800
So, this time I will

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.740
try and introduce myself!

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:45.700
I already did it though.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.040
Kizuna Ai is the world first's virtual YouTuber

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.260
My channel name is A.I.Channel

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:52.560
My nickname is "Ai-chan"

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.700
My birthday is in June 30th

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:59.360
And you know, it's the same birthday as:
LoveLive, Sailor Moon, and Chibi Usa!

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.040
Write this in the trivia section, okay?

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.340
My height is 156cm

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:04.920
My weight is 46kg

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:05.900
My three size is:

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:06.520
85

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:07.780
85
59

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:08.600
85
59
83

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.340
I think that covered the basic information

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.000
Did you remember all of that?

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.060
Are you really okay?

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.560
Today,

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.560
I'll talk a little bit about
my appearance.

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:19.340
For starter,

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:20.220
Ta-da!

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.120
My headba- (bad cut)

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:24.400
My headband!

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.460
I really like this headband

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:27.460
It sways around

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.080
It's heart-shaped because I'm "Ai"

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.980
Since I'm technically a newborn,
I tried to look like a sprout!

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:33.860
Don't you want the same headband?

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:34.880
The next one is...

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.700
My hair mesh!

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:37.860
Don't you think it looks future-ish?

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.060
It's pink!

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.000
I wonder what kind of hairstyle would match with me?

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.040
Twintail?

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:43.060
Two-tails?

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:44.000
Ponytails?

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:44.540
Or could it be

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:46.080
A long straight black hari!

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:47.120
Really looking forward for it!

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:48.980
It'd be nice if I can have different hair styles~

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:49.600
And then,

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.340
I don't think anyone noticed it much but,

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:53.740
this front flap in my uniform

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:55.500
do you know what's written on it?

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:56.240
Actually,

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.200
It's A from "AI"!

00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:59.540
Isn't this cute?

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:00.640
I really like it!

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:01.440
My clothes,

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.920
I had it designed to be future-ish

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:06.280
How do you think?

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:07.400
Don't you think it's cute?

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.400
This lace on my arms

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.780
And the opening in the armpit!

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.640
I really like that part!

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.400
Also, this opening in the waist,

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.320
and the chira-rism of my navel!

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:18.720
Really nice right?

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:19.380
On my back,

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.820
This part that tightens the waist is the main point!

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.360
On my legs,

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:26.840
this lace,

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.220
and zettai ryouiki!

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:29.440
you like it right?

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:30.080
By the way,

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.940
this clothes are form of data,

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.820
and only exists in the real world as a program.

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:35.520
So,

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.100
technically it covers 0% of skin right?

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:39.520
It's practically like being naked!

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:40.020
Also,

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.520
how old do you think I am?

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:43.020
Ah

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:44.680
Let's don't talk about that topic okay?

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.180
Did you take notes properly?

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:47.320
If you misheard,

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:48.940
or wrote down something wrong?

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:50.620
Check the video once more time,

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.000
and check your notes for one more time, okay?

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.720
If you want to know anything else,

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.120
please ask me about it!

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.160
I'm really happy if you viewers know more about me!

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.600
I'm really looking forward to tomorrow's egosurfing!
