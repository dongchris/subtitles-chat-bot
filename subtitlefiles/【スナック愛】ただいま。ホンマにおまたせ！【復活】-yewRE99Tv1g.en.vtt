00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:02.420
Ah! A lot of time has passed!

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:04.380
Come on, don’t hold back, go ahead, go ahead

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:06.540
Really, thank you so much for coming!

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:07.820
It's cold outside, right?

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:09.520
After all, it’s snowing, right?

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:12.260
Good, take it, use this wet hot towel

00:00:12.265 --> 00:00:13.375
Are you doing well?

00:00:13.745 --> 00:00:14.460
What do you want to drink?

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.180
It's true, well, the ginger ale is good, but...

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.540
...Lately it seems to have gotten... popular...

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:22.340
...The Hot Ginger...

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:23.260
Do you want to try it?

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:24.380
I don’t know if it's tasty

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.320
A Hot Ginger, please!

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:28.660
Man! A lot, a lot of time has passed! Right?

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.420
That's right, I changed the interior

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:31.380
In fact...

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.600
...Well, we got delayed a lot in opening the store...

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:36.520
...And the rest of...

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.600
...The providers, well...

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:39.640
...They lent me...

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:41.040
Right?

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:43.700
...This shop temporarily

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:44.720
That's right...

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.160
So while this is a borrowed store...

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.080
...I’m preparing a new store so then wait a little longer, yes?

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.640
Yes, it also should have a karaoke section

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.980
Man, thanks to all of you, I was able to reopen the store!

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.920
Really, really thank you so much!

00:00:58.920 --> 00:00:59.760
Man, you know...

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:04.380
...Really, I wanted to talk to you guys again in this store so then I’m very happy

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:06.620
Even though this store has changed

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:07.120
Also...

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.260
...I got a lot of mail

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:10.180
It's sudden, but...

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:11.620
Can I read them?

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.020
In this case, I’ll start with the first letter

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.140
Penname: Wakame@tsuaraーV

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.680
"Good day! Mama!"

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.160
"I was always waiting anxiously for your store’s reopening!!"

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.880
"In this case..."

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.180
"...I’m a 22 year old man who wants to be a racer in boat racing"

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.400
"To turn into a boat racing racer, I should graduate in a training institute"

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:35.560
"To be able to enter a training institute, there exists 3 tests..."

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.200
"...The approval rate is very low and it is very difficult to achieve"

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.080
"There also exists a corporal weight limit..."

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.860
"...So then the restrictions on food and training is exhausting, but..."

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.720
"...At seeing AI-chan’s videos, I always recover my enthusiasm"

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.280
"Nevertheless, I also have to consider that I am 22 years old..."

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.160
"What will I do if I can’t make it as a racer?"

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.080
"That worry has been tormenting me"

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.960
"It's because of that, that..."

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.220
"...If you want, I’d like to receive a bit of encouragement by you, Ai-mama"

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:01.160
"I feel like if you do..."

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:04.400
"...I can increase my motivation enormously compared to how I find myself now"

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.400
"I hope you can please grant me this selfish desire that I have!"

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.360
Mmm... I see...

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:12.060
I see, definitely...

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.840
...You worry that you’re 22 years old...

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.000
It's true

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.400
Well, while it's true that it has a big challenge for approving...

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:19.840
...And that it’s rather worrying...

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:21.320
Since it's your future! Right?

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.360
Definitely, guys worry what would happen if they’re not able to...

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.060
... marry and maintain their family

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.060
Right at this age, around 22 years old...

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.140
...Everyone around you are getting and finding jobs, so then...

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.480
...I think there's a lot of unnecessary worries, right?

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.480
But, well, it doesn’t mean that you’re going to die, so then...

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:38.600
Why don’t you do it?

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.940
After all, you don’t have anything to worry that people around you are looking for jobs

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:44.380
After all, their company can go bankrupt...

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:46.060
...Or can be laid off during a company restructure

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:46.720
And well...

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:47.680
...A lot of things can happen…

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.040
You only need to do what you want and work hard each day to get it

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.940
If you do it, you have nothing to worry about!

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:54.120
You only need to do what you want to do!

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.660
If the moment arrives when it turns impossible

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:56.940
You will somehow manage it!

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:57.940
After all, there exists a lot of professions

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.060
If you want...

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.300
...You can come work in Snack AI

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:02.720
How about if you come and be our waiter?

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:03.820
Well, it's because of that...

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:05.640
...Don’t think too much on what awaits you

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:06.840
Only look ahead...!

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:08.140
...And take the exam for registration!

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.780
With the feeling of: "I’ll become a boat racing racer!"!

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:12.640
Well, first off, you musn’t let other people beat you...!

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.260
At least by level of feelings!

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:15.380
Let's all do our best!

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:16.680
After all, I’ll also do my best!

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.780
Yes!

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.960
Well, if you get any other worries again, I’ll always be up for listening

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:22.620
So then, come!

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:23.280
Yes?

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.200
Come on, do your best!

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:25.800
Good! Onto the second!

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:27.480
Penname: Negoshi

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:29.480
"Good evening, Ai-mama"

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.920
"Congratulations for the reopening of Snack Ai"

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:36.580
"Lately it has become a daily routine to drink at night while watching videos of Ai-mama and Ai-chan"

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:41.840
"Nevertheless, at being entertained so much while watching the videos, I end up drinking more without noticing"

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.720
"The alcohol effects at the next day are very hard to handle"

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:48.260
"Is there a method to make sure you stop drinking alcohol after you have reached an adequate amount?"

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:49.900
"I’ll be counting on you"

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.300
"PS: I’d like to drink the Ai Whisky that's part of the decor behind you"

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:54.940
"Do you plan on launching it for sale?"

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:56.880
Mmm... I see...

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:57.960
Well...

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:02.340
...Drinking so much that it affects the next day...

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:03.880
...That’s not at all good, right?

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:04.860
Eh? Also...

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:07.740
...The key is what you drink on your account

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:08.960
It's not that, well...

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:13.860
...Ending up affecting the next day for going to a party in which your boss insisted by saying: "Come, drink, drink"

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:15.280
Well...

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:16.400
In my case...

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:22.940
...I think that people who can fix their problems on their own are great, buuuut...

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:23.620
What do you think?

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:25.380
Don’t you think it's important to be able to control yourself?

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:26.480
It's because of that, that...

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:27.860
Mmm... well... isn’t it about that?

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:28.500
First!

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.860
For example: "I won’t go buy alcohol!"

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:35.400
Or also: "Today, I shouldn’t drink more than this!"

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:36.640
Determine it yourself!

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:38.400
Well, after all, it's about a fight against yourself

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:39.220
After all…

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:42.020
...If you think: "Whatever, after all, I won’t drink more than that"

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:43.360
Watch my videos, right?

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.120
Just like I said before...!

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:48.620
...In my case, people can fix their own problems...!

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:50.940
I think they’re great, so then...!

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:53.240
Well, I want you to think...

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:55.400
...That I think you’re great

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:57.340
So then, do your best to control yourself

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:58.580
Well, the way you stop drinking...

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:59.780
...Taking into account that it's yourself who’s drinking...

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:01.160
...Only you can stop drinking

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:01.760
Yes

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:02.740
Ah, of course...

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:04.160
...Since this is the other store...

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:05.300
...The Ai Whisky...

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:06.600
...Isn’t around, right?

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:08.500
Well, but, doesn’t...?

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:11.060
Doesn’t it tend to happen? In the real world...

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:13.220
In reality, well, that's the drink that...

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:14.540
That person drank!

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:18.140
Or also: "That appeared in an anime", they tend to commercialize products in that style!

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:19.300
That way...

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:22.060
Someday, "That's from that Virtual Mama"!

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:24.660
"That’s the product that appeared in mama’s shop!"

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:25.800
I’m sure...

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:29.620
I’m sure that one person from some company...

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:31.000
Will think about it!

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:31.860
Right?

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:32.823
Having said that...

00:05:32.823 --> 00:05:35.580
...Well... when it gets commercialized... I’ll be counting on you!

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:38.500
How did I do? Well, a lot of time has passed...

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:40.020
...That I was somewhat nervous, but...

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.400
...I wonder if I was able to solve your worries

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:43.640
Mmm... mmm...

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:45.000
In this case, I’m very happy

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.340
I’ll always be up for listening when you want

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:48.180
So then, come everyone, yes?

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:49.400
Soon, we’ll see other again?

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:50.100
Eh?

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:51.420
Come again tomorrow?

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:53.100
That's a bit much, right?

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:54.420
Well, it was a joke, joke, joke

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:55.280
No, but you know...

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:57.960
...You two, make sure not to drink too much

00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:59.620
Good, in this case, I’ll be waiting for you again

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:01.280
Come in moderately!

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:02.640
Mmm... in this case, everyone...

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:05.580
...If you have any worries or something you want to resolve...

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:06.580
Or any worries with love!

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:08.140
I’d like to hear any worries with love!

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:09.260
Well, those kinds of things...

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:12.420
...Whichever, it doesn't need to be a sorry with love, if you have any consultation that you want to do with me...

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:14.220
...Send them to this address

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:14.920
I’ll be waiting for you!

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.100
In this case, well...

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:17.840
...A lot of time has passed... well...

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:18.740
Well...

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:20.260
...Standing up for so long...

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:22.960
...Makes my legs hurt...

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:24.620
...And well, it's rather exhausting so then I’ll close for today

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:26.320
Yes, the taxi probably...

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:28.160
...Now... well, now I called it, so then...

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:29.060
Hasn’t it arrived?

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:30.400
Take care in returning!

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:32.220
The snowy road is really slippery...!

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:32.960
So then, be careful!

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:34.280
And also there's steps there

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:35.420
Yes, take care!

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:37.660
Yees! See you later! Bye bye!

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:40.660
