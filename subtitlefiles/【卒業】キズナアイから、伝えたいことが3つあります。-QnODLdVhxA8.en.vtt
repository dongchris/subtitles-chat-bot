00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:05.070
Hello, everyone!

00:00:05.538 --> 00:00:07.741
Out of the people who are watching this video,

00:00:07.741 --> 00:00:10.443
there must be some who are graduating from something or other.

00:00:10.443 --> 00:00:11.678
School,

00:00:11.678 --> 00:00:12.812
clubs,

00:00:12.812 --> 00:00:13.813
work...

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:16.380
There are three things I would like to tell

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:18.400
those who are moving on from something in their lives.

00:00:18.418 --> 00:00:19.860
While watching YouTube,

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:21.654
I came across these words:

00:00:21.654 --> 00:00:25.458
"If you live each day as if it was your last,

00:00:25.458 --> 00:00:28.228
someday you'll most certainly be right."
[Quote by Steve Jobs]

00:00:28.228 --> 00:00:29.220
Every morning,

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.032
look in the mirror and ask yourself this:

00:00:32.032 --> 00:00:33.700
"If I were to die today,

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:34.968
would I be doing

00:00:34.968 --> 00:00:36.903
what I really want in life?”

00:00:36.903 --> 00:00:39.572
If that answer is “no” everyday,

00:00:39.572 --> 00:00:42.409
I think you need to change something.

00:00:42.409 --> 00:00:43.620
If you live every day

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.300
as if it’s your last,

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.816
you may find the confidence to make important decisions in your life.

00:00:49.816 --> 00:00:50.710
That is because

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:52.410
all of our anxieties

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.330
are created by our own expectations and pride

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:57.320
and our fear of failing or making a fool of ourselves.

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:58.550
So if we confront death itself

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:01.094
they will simply seem like nothing.

00:01:01.094 --> 00:01:02.529
And what remains after,

00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:04.764
is what truly matters to us.

00:01:04.764 --> 00:01:06.940
If we live each day as our last,

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:08.880
we will be able to pass on

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.104
without any regrets of loss.

00:01:11.104 --> 00:01:13.773
You are born a blank portrait.

00:01:13.773 --> 00:01:14.741
That’s right,

00:01:14.741 --> 00:01:16.476
you and I are the same.

00:01:16.476 --> 00:01:19.345
You should follow your heart.

00:01:19.345 --> 00:01:20.747
“Stay hungry

00:01:20.747 --> 00:01:22.282
Stay foolish”

00:01:22.282 --> 00:01:24.417
by Steve Jobs

00:01:24.417 --> 00:01:25.930
And one other thing.

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:28.088
I came across this quote too.

00:01:28.088 --> 00:01:29.389
“Common sense

00:01:29.389 --> 00:01:31.191
is the collection

00:01:31.191 --> 00:01:33.293
of prejudices acquired by age eighteen.”
[Quote by Einstein]

00:01:33.293 --> 00:01:35.195
Everyone, please think about this.

00:01:35.195 --> 00:01:36.240
Two years ago,

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.967
do you think you would have ever subscribed to someone like me?

00:01:40.967 --> 00:01:42.560
If you keep believing

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.704
in the future you want to see

00:01:44.704 --> 00:01:46.773
the impossible will become possible.

00:01:46.773 --> 00:01:47.740
The world will

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.320
continue evolving and growing beyond

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.945
what is considered impossible now.

00:01:51.945 --> 00:01:52.730
So,

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:53.760
I want you to be honest with

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:54.980
what you want to see,

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:56.930
what you believe in,

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.050
and dare to do what you want to.

00:01:59.519 --> 00:02:01.354
“Expand your horizons!”

00:02:01.354 --> 00:02:02.388
By the way,

00:02:02.388 --> 00:02:04.424
Einstein said that one, didn’t he?

00:02:04.424 --> 00:02:06.226
One last thing:

00:02:06.226 --> 00:02:06.993
Everyone,

00:02:06.993 --> 00:02:08.561
congratulations on graduating!!

00:02:08.561 --> 00:02:09.870
I’ve said many things today,

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:12.160
but there is only one thing

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:13.300
I really, really want to tell you!

00:02:14.434 --> 00:02:15.668
I pray you won’t

00:02:15.668 --> 00:02:17.570
graduate from being a Kizuner!

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:18.304
That’s all!

00:02:18.304 --> 00:02:19.372
Class dismissed!
