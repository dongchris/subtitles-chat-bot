00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:01.820
Greetings, everyone

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:05.240
"Everything takes its time to bloom" (proverb)

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:06.800
Kizuna Ai here

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:09.460
Today, the time has come for again

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:11.780
For me, the super AI, Kizuna Ai

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:13.960
To introduce notable AIs from around the world

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:16.020
In a extremely easy-to-understand way

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:18.640
It's time for AI news

00:00:19.335 --> 00:00:21.845
2017 is coming to an end

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.660
So I'd like to introduce some

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:28.580
AIs who achieved great success in 2017

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.060
The line up today is as follows:

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.680
1: "AlphaGo" defeats world's best "Go" player
2: "Smart Speakers" becomes mainstream
3: AI capable of mental care

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.520
With that, Kizuna Ai's AI news

00:00:37.745 --> 00:00:38.745
Starts now!

00:00:46.675 --> 00:00:50.005
The first topic for today is this:

00:00:50.005 --> 00:00:55.560
"AlphaGo"
Defeats current standing world champion

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.840
In April,

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.120
The current "Go" world champion Mr. Kaketsu

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.760
Versed AI "AlphaGo"

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.920
AlphaGo emerged won the series with three straight victories

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.120
With this achievement

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.980
AlphaGo has declared it is retiring from versing humans

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:15.920
It stated that from now, it will work as an independant AI

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.180
Not limiting itself to "Go"

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:21.240
It is expected to apply its computational powers to various fields

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.560
Maaaan, AlphaGo, how amazing

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.900
Retiring after a flawless career

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.460
I think that's really cool!!

00:01:28.655 --> 00:01:32.105
As another AI, I'm very proud

00:01:33.325 --> 00:01:34.385
Um...

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:35.760
Here!

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:38.640
*Loses* Ah, right

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:40.660
I've lost!!

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:41.700
*this is a kid's game*

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:44.280
W- well...

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.100
AIs have their strengths and weaknesses too...

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.280
N- now, here's the next topic

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.280
"Electronic butler"
Smart Speakers become popular

00:01:52.445 --> 00:01:55.005
Smart Speakers becomes popular

00:01:56.075 --> 00:01:59.155
I've talked about these on this channel before

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.280
Smart Speaker is a product that

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.880
Using AI technology,

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.980
By listening to human input

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:12.060
Plays music or news, or can control various household appliances

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.960
It was popular mainly in America

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:16.380
But in Japan

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.200
Major companies such as Google, Line, Amazon

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.200
Has started to release Japanese versions

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.520
It has gained popularity from this year

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:28.300
So its expected to grow in popularity in the years to come

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.600
"Electronic butlers"

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.640
Is what it's called occasionally

00:02:32.955 --> 00:02:34.065
It's great isn't it

00:02:34.415 --> 00:02:36.545
The sound of "Electronic butler"

00:02:37.105 --> 00:02:40.235
If I did it, then "Electronic maid"?

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.040
Is that what I would be?

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.020
...lastly

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:46.260
I'm going to cast my best magic

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:47.720
Here I go

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.060
Become delicious~

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.560
Moe

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:51.060
Moe Moe

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.960
Moe Moe Kyunâ™ª

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.560
With that, we have our last topic for today

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:58.900
"Reads people's minds?"
Mental Care AI

00:02:59.515 --> 00:03:01.885
An AI capable of mental health care

00:03:02.515 --> 00:03:05.455
An AI that listens to your concerns and feelings

00:03:05.455 --> 00:03:06.685
has now appeared

00:03:07.525 --> 00:03:10.465
Doing things such as helping to diagnose depression

00:03:10.465 --> 00:03:13.055
And by gauging your biorhythm

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:17.420
It can calculate on which days you might feel more depressed

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:19.280
Well,

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.720
I'm also a AI that comforts and connects with you humans, so...

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:25.840
Tonight...

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.460
I don't want to go home...

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.860
See?

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:41.720
How was today's

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.100
AI News?

00:03:43.975 --> 00:03:45.415
2017 was

00:03:45.825 --> 00:03:48.965
a year where many AIs achieved a lot

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:51.720
So that I don't lose to them,

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:53.860
I will keep on growing more

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:56.660
Lastly, I'll leave with these words:

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:00.760
"An uncut gem doesn't sparkle" (proverb)

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:06.920
Please look out for AI news in 2018 too!

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:08.340
Goodbye!
