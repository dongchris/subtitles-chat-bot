Hello everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai here!

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:04.820
It's entrance exam season lately, right?

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:06.880
Although I haven't done any tests

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:08.680
I know it's a hard thing to go through

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:09.540
Therefore...

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.600
I’ve looked up about tests

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:15.460
And found "Things that can't be said to test takers"

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:16.740
And that's...

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:17.940
Fai◯

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:20.660
I want to help humans out!

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:25.540
So today! I am going to ◯◯il for all the test takers!

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:28.460
[Starting from impersonation]

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:29.520
"Kizuna AI..."

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:31.320
"Kizuna AI..."

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.100
"Kizuna AI..."

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:34.880
"Kizuna AI!"

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:36.680
"KIZuna AI!"

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:38.340
"KIZUNA AI!!"

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.240
"Shut up!!"

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:45.240
"Kizuna AI's
Virtual skit
Hamburger restaurant"

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.680
"Excuse me, can I have a hamburger set?"

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:52.200
"Sure, are you having it here? Or take out?"

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.960
"Please transfer them as data"

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.700
"You can't even eat them if you do that!!"

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:00.300
Playing Shiritori#1 myself!
(Japanese word game in which the players are required to say a word which begins with the final kana of the previous word)

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.340
Shirito[ri] （しりと[り]）

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:02.700
[Ri]a coast（[リ]アス式かいが[ん]#2）

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:03.240
Oh...

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:04.620
Okay! Game over!

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:06.140
Ding! Ding! Ding!

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.460
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Look here, look here!

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.560
Ummmmm, elbow!

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:18.620
Okay! With that, I’m now done

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:21.160
I’m mentally very tired!!

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.160
For all the test takers, I know it's going to be hard but...

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:25.120
Don't give up!

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.520
I'll never give up on my dreams or things I want to do

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:31.595
To keep on doing something... is a tough job and hard, but...

00:01:31.595 --> 00:01:34.235
I’m not going to give up on them so you shouldn't too!!

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.960
I hope, from my heart, that everyone can achieve their dream!

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.480
