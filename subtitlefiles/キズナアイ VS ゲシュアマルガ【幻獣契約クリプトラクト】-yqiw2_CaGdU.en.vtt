00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:09.820

How do I express this, it's like

00:00:11.735 --> 00:00:14.565
I'm really in shocked and I can't express myself enough

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:17.140

Please take a look at this!

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:23.060
As my personal favorite

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.480
it's this girl, Kurariche-chan!

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:27.160
She is so adorable, isn't she?

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:28.580
*sound when receiving damage*

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:30.180
KA-WA-II

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:33.880
this is what you called super adorable

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:35.500
I've became much stronger

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.500
With that being said..you guys..

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:42.340
If....I can clear a difficulty of 3 or above and achieve victory!

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.300
Then it's fine for me to summon a few, right?

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:46.580
So...Prepare yourself!

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:48.980
It's only difficulty 3, I can do this!

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.520
Difficulty 3.2, why not~!

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:53.720
3.2...

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:54.800
Let's try it!

00:00:55.835 --> 00:00:56.835
Only way is to win!

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:02.040
Hang in there!

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.240
OH! OH! OH! Looking Good! Looking good!....

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:05.320

OH! OH! Looking good! Looking good!

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.920
Why is she healing...That's cheating... cheating...cheating....

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.340
Healing is cheating...

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.800
Ah! So close!

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.380
OH! YES! I can do it! Only...Only...

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.260
Only boss left! I can do it!

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.000

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:28.800
Hang in there!

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.020
EH!? Not Good! That one attack is unbelievably strong

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:32.300
Not Good! Not Good!

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.340
I'm being too corky..3.2 is too much! I'm sorry!

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:35.920
AH! This is too much!!

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.400

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:38.220

Not only my HP is all max

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.120
there is only one enemy left!

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.260
As I expected 3.2 is too easy

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.100
5.1 is probably also a piece of cake too

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.500
