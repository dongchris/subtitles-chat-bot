Happy New Year everyone!

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:07.400
Virtual YouTuber, Kizuna Ai here!

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:09.180
2017 was a year where

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:10.880
I got to go to events

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:12.160
Appear in a commercial

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.180
And managed to pass 1 million subscribers

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:16.980
It was a year of leaps and strides!!

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.800
In 2018...

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.060
I'll keep trying my best

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.060
To connect with more people

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:25.800
So please keep supporting me!!

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:29.640
Alright, cut, cut!

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:30.920
Aaah...

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:32.620
What happened, everyone?

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:36.900
[ Baby Ai ]
*baby noises*

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:37.960
[ Big Sister Ai ]
Uh huh, uh huh...

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.740
[ Big Sister Ai ]
"Let me greet everyone too!"

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:42.780
[ Big Sister Ai ]
Is what she's saying...

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:44.980
[ Opportunistic Ai ]
Yep, yep! That's right, that's right!

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.380
[ Opportunistic Ai ]
Might as well have everyone do it!

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.180
[ Opportunistic Ai ]
A year amounts to its start! 
(saying)

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:51.960
[ Positive Ai ]
My theme for this year is...

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:53.000
[ Positive Ai ]
Try hard!

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.040
[ Positive Ai ]
If you try hard you can change yourself

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.800
[ Positive Ai ]
If you try hard, you can change the world!

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.720
Hold up, hold up!

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:01.500
Everyone's being too free!

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.320
It's the year's very beginning

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.380
We have to be more serious about this!

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.320
[ Negative Ai ]
Well, that might be right, but...

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.400
[ Negative Ai ]
For our channel...

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.980
[ Negative Ai ]
I don't think that's what people come here for...

00:01:14.485 --> 00:01:16.005
[ Negative Ai ]
We should be more...

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:18.560
[ Negative Ai ]
Like, laid back...

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.900
[ Negative Ai ]
I reckon we can just do it without really having to care...

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:22.880
Mmmm...

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.780
Really...?

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.180
[ Sexy Ai ]
Are you all eating them...?

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.640
Kelp rolls

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.940
[ Mama Ai ]
That doesn't make sense

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.640
[ Mama Ai ]
Using a sexy voice doesn't validate what you're saying!

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.600
[ Mama Ai ]
Well, either way

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.440
[ Mama Ai ]
We should all properly greet everyone at some point, no?

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:43.520
[ Opportunistic Ai ]
Right, right!

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:44.740
[ Opportunistic Ai ]
Let's greet everyone together!

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:46.240
You're right, I guess

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.180
Alright everyone, line up, line up!

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.760
A.I.Channel~!

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.340
In 2018, Kizuna Ai will, as a YouTuber

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.320
Try even harder!

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:57.560
[ Sexy Ai ]
Stuff like that...

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:58.720
[ Opportunistic Ai ]
And stuff like this...

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.140
[ Mama Ai ]
I'm going to challenge myself to do all kinds of stuff!

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.860
[ Negative Ai ]
...While putting less effort in when possible...

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.000
[ Positive Ai ]
No, no!

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.280
[ Positive Ai ]
I'll always be trying 100% hard!

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:11.920
[ Baby Ai ]
*baby noises*

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.840
[ Big Sister Ai ]
Yep, yep!

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.960
[ Big Sister Ai ]
We want to continue...

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:17.200
[ Big Sister Ai ]
Making videos that everyone enjoys!

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.580
And so, for 2018...

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.800
Thank you in advance!!

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:24.520
That's it!

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.520
This was Virtual YouTuber, Kizuna Ai!

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.540
Looking forward to our year together!

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.980
