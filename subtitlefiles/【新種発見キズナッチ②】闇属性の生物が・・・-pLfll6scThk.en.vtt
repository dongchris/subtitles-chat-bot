00:00:00.112 --> 00:00:01.650
Hello, everyone.

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:02.800
I'm your maestro,

00:00:03.264 --> 00:00:04.520
Kizuna Ai...

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:05.440
How are you doing?

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:06.523
Huh, it feels like

00:00:06.523 --> 00:00:10.030
I'm spinning a lot more than usual.

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:11.008
How's that?

00:00:11.552 --> 00:00:13.260
That was exhausting.

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:15.130
Hello, let me introduce myself once again.

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:17.460
I'm Kizuna Ai the Maestro!

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.460
Today, we have a machine that will send out the names

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.650
of animals and inanimate objects.

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.270
Let us create ourselves some new species.

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:31.040
Today, we have a box which can only be seen by 5-year-olds at most.

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.980
Let's go with this.

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.600
Shakeshakeshakeshake!

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.000
A denture...

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.930
Alright, next one is...

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:40.170
Shakeshakeshakey!

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.440
A snail!

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.500
This is getting a little weird.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.936
A denture and a snail.

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:50.434
Let's combine both and create an original animal!

00:00:50.768 --> 00:00:52.436
Let's get drawing!

00:00:53.008 --> 00:00:54.438
So...

00:00:54.816 --> 00:00:55.984
Denture.

00:00:58.976 --> 00:01:00.096
[laughs]

00:01:02.992 --> 00:01:04.000
Denture...

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.552
From the side you can see the gum.

00:01:08.912 --> 00:01:10.896
It's a little bit disgusting.

00:01:11.472 --> 00:01:13.024
And then,

00:01:15.488 --> 00:01:16.800
the snail.

00:01:17.312 --> 00:01:19.396
Some texture for the gum.

00:01:23.904 --> 00:01:25.230
How is that?

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:26.590
It's like,

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.210
A snail has its shell, right?

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.360
It'll be sad if it's just the slug without one!

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.176
And so, I made it like this.

00:01:37.376 --> 00:01:38.336
Eyes!

00:01:40.884 --> 00:01:41.888
The eyes!

00:01:44.576 --> 00:01:46.440
How is that?

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:47.870
It's so cute!

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:50.360
It's like when a girl just repeats saying cute.

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.090
I've decided on a name too!

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:53.660
It's Iname-chan!

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:54.670
How's that?

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:56.300
A cute name for this being

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.200
full of cuteness and filth?

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.200
Because it's a denture and a snail, (Iname and Namekuji}

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.450
that makes Iname-chan!

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:03.050
Its ecology will be...

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:07.800
If he's came out of the denture, it'll melt.

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.640
It won't melt from salt!

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.950
It'll melt from sugar...

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:13.840
So sad...

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.260
And if it gets drenched in water, it'll melt too.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.470
What a sad little thing!

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.200
And the denture will be all that remains.

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.794
Its food are your hopes and dreams.

00:02:24.794 --> 00:02:26.700
Let's go for the next one!

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.100
Jumblejumblejumblejumble!

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:30.270
Pineapple!

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:31.160
Next one.

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.800
Jumblejumblejumblejumbley!

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:34.960
An owl!

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.710
Looks like this can be cute.

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:39.910
Let's get straight to the drawing board!

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:42.288
A pineapple will be...

00:02:44.352 --> 00:02:47.024
It has something like a crown.

00:02:49.744 --> 00:02:52.940
If we divide a pinapple by its parts, it'll be the crown

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:54.090
and the edible fruit.

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:55.760
For the owl,

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:56.976
it should go like this.

00:03:00.144 --> 00:03:01.120
Like,

00:03:02.208 --> 00:03:03.392
pretty much this.

00:03:04.301 --> 00:03:06.800
This owl is quite huge!

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.560
[laughs]

00:03:09.773 --> 00:03:12.620
It's scary!

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:14.300
It's pretty much like this.

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:15.779
That means...

00:03:17.312 --> 00:03:18.350
This...

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:20.224
I'm quite scared now.

00:03:21.472 --> 00:03:22.240
This.

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:23.550
The hair--

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:24.120
Oh!

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.860
I know, I know!

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:27.930
It's not something you put on the head,

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.250
but it'll be its wings.

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:30.624
The pineapple

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:32.992
made like this.

00:03:33.616 --> 00:03:34.656
Then,

00:03:37.008 --> 00:03:39.100
let's put a pinapple hat on top.

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:40.144
The fruit.

00:03:40.737 --> 00:03:41.600
Oh, but...

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.072
Hmm...

00:03:44.741 --> 00:03:46.920
Oh! A pineapple,

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.970
if we cut it, it'll be like this, right?

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:50.200
So,

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:51.340
and then,

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.760
we'll put on a pineapple necklace!

00:03:54.912 --> 00:03:56.160
Like this!

00:03:57.568 --> 00:03:58.672
Pineapple!

00:03:59.488 --> 00:04:00.464
Then,

00:04:05.696 --> 00:04:07.488
it has a pineapple beak...

00:04:08.048 --> 00:04:09.370
Hmm!

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:10.240
Pineapple!

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:11.720
Let's make its body a pineapple too!

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:14.590
Let's redraw it like this.

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:16.416
And so...

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:21.984
An owl's ears are like this, right?

00:04:22.432 --> 00:04:24.620
But were there owls which don't have ears?

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:28.000
Let's just make the ears its charm point.

00:04:29.296 --> 00:04:30.288
Eyes!

00:04:31.376 --> 00:04:34.000
Let's go with a little horror feel.

00:04:35.728 --> 00:04:37.744
Like it's gone mad!

00:04:38.416 --> 00:04:41.088
Seems difficult to draw a mad person!

00:04:42.666 --> 00:04:43.660
Then,

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:46.112
the pineapple necklace.

00:04:52.816 --> 00:04:53.600
Oh!

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:56.160
It's like that...

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.600
Iname-chan's dark side!

00:05:01.776 --> 00:05:03.728
Here's the wings.

00:05:04.304 --> 00:05:05.936
Like pineapples.

00:05:10.944 --> 00:05:12.528
Like this.

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:14.864
Then a pineapple.

00:05:19.168 --> 00:05:20.960
Then the feet.

00:05:22.448 --> 00:05:23.648
A foot.

00:05:24.048 --> 00:05:25.712
Zoom! A foot...

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:30.288
[chuckles]

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:31.900
Then,

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:33.552
this is important!

00:05:34.624 --> 00:05:37.648
It's a madman from the dark side.

00:05:38.864 --> 00:05:40.240
The eyes are like...

00:05:41.664 --> 00:05:44.080
It's eyes are red...

00:05:48.432 --> 00:05:50.496
Like it's going to pop out.

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:52.304
Then,

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:56.072
this will be another charm point.

00:05:58.896 --> 00:05:59.984
How's that?

00:06:00.928 --> 00:06:02.730
Can you feel the darkness?

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:04.830
I can feel the darkness!

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:05.710
Nope, nope, nope.

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:07.210
I made this on purpose.

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:09.632
The name will be...

00:06:10.086 --> 00:06:13.000
A pineapple and an owl.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.910
The name will be PPFP.

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:16.040
Pineapple

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:17.200
Pineapple Pineapple

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:18.350
Pineapple Pineapple Owl

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:19.760
Pineapple Pineapple Owl Coo! Like that...

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:21.900
Well, like I've said before,

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:23.260
this creature came from the dark side.

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.150
Well, usually

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:26.670
the eyes aren't actually red.

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:28.670
But when it sees a normie,

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:31.880
its eyes will redden and blood comes from its mouth.

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:34.590
And it'll do that to the normies.

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:36.830
He'll shoot out his wings,

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:40.090
and lots of sharp pieces from a pineapple will come out.

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:42.810
And it'll stab the normie.

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:43.850
How's that?

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:44.970
How was that?

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:48.040
As expected from Kizuna Ai-san's masterpiece.

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:51.200
I'll keep finding new species,

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:53.680
so please send an email to the address on the home page

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:56.940
with names of animals and inanimate objects.

00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:59.120
Gotta catch 'em all!
