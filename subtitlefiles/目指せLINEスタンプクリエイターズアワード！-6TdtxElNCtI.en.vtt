Hello there!

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:04.040
It's me the virtual youtuber Kizuna Ai

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:07.060
so what kind of Line stickers do you use?

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:15.640
today, december 5, is the Line Creators Stamp Awards'  result announcement

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:17.040
it has nothing to do with me though

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:21.160
what do you think will be this year's creator's stamp award will be?

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.760

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:25.500

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:26.420

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.540
so lets start creating one

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.920
the character will be of course me, so lets decide what theme we'll be using

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:46.240
looking  at the sticker nominees, you can see that there are a lot of animal characters

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:47.460
should i try cosplaying?

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.580
like a bunny, a bear, or a cat

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.780
oh, look at this one

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:52.560

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:53.320

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:54.320

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:55.280
a swearing bear

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:56.060
a one-eyelid bunny

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.760

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.440
after looking at those, we'll take it as a reference

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.820
and make a sticker that shows my appeal

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.740
so with that i have decided the theme!

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:21.850
Ai-chan is cute so you'll definitely forgive me-sticker

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.100
instead of you, I'll be the one doing the sorry, pleading for it: kind of sticker

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.360
im sure with my cuteness, anything will be forgiven

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:30.700

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.280
