00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:04.440
Let's move on to the next question.

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:05.120
Yes

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:07.320
There is one thing I'm really curious about.

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.720
Frankly speaking, do you make good money off this?

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:14.100
You know how the top tier YouTubers earn quite a lot of money, right?

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:15.680
But you're still starting out.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.900
So I'm wondering if you make enough to earn a living.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.320
About that...

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:24.720
Well, I'm not earning that much.

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.280
Really, not that much.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.000
I mean, for someone who makes a living off this...

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:29.320
First of all, those people

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.920
have like 100,000 or 1,000,000 people

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.160
that subscribed to their channel.

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:37.600
With my views alone, I can't really live off that!

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.560
Everyone, make sure you watch the videos more!

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:41.140
And then, share the videos.

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.120
What will you do with the money you earn?

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.420
About that...with the money that I earn...

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:48.400
Rather than using it all for myself...

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.700
Well, it's still technically for me,

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:54.660
I'd like to use it to bring everyone together.

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:55.820
What do you mean?

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:56.620
For example,

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:00.200
Like using the whole VR system to do a live broadcast.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.380
So then, everyone'll get hit on their heads, and enter this white space?

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:06.720
If they were to equip the VR headgear

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:07.420
Absolutely!

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:09.220
A nice big thwack!

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:10.720
I prefer something less painful

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.240
It doesn't hurt that much.

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.120
It hurts because you think it hurts.

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:18.440
Wow, uhh, hearing an A.I. say that is convincing, and yet, not.

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:19.080
It's convincing.

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.400
Ah, Ai-chan. Do you usually eat something?

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:23.880
I don't eat anything. My food cost is ï¿¥0.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:25.360
So then,

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.080
Beside your cost of living, do you spend money for your needs?

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.080
I don't have any cost of living, but

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.540
to do all this kind of stuff, I need

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:36.080
this (money)

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.840
Yeah, well... that's all adult stuff.

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:41.360
All sorts of things need that (money).

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:41.860
Ai: This (money) / Panora: I see.

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:42.540
Ai: This (money) / Panora: I see.

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:43.440
Ai: This (money) / Panora: I see.

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.900
So if you can get some money, then you could also wear cute clothes.

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.960
Ah! Yes, I would change my costume.

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.520
I feel like I was manipulated into saying that.

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.980
You realized?

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.900
It must be some kind of magic in this white virtual space.

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:00.060
I'll change the question a bit.

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.320
May I make the question a bit harder?

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:02.280
Sure, that's fine.

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:06.360
Lately, the media has been talking about AI.

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.060
About how In the future, it'll slowly taking away jobs from humans.

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:11.200
Or so they say.

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.060
From an AI's perspective

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.160
Do you have any opinions on that?

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:18.340
Let me see...

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:24.500
Rather than 'taking away' jobs, well, work is about increasing efficiency.

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.640
There are definitely things that only humans can do.

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.900
And AI isn't 100% perfect.

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.920
So in the end, a human has to make the judgment call, or decision.

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.800
Basically, use AI wherever you can,

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:48.540
wherever it will help improve the efficiency of work, so that the world can become an easier place to live in.

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.740
Wow, that's such a normal response!

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.860
Well! Well then!

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.780
How rude!

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.660
Then I won't answer normally anymore.

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.720
No, please, let's go with normal answers.

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.300
No. I'm going to be a rebel.

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.040
Geez, this interview is pretty hard to do! What do I do? (laughs)

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:07.680
This is just practice, practice!

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.380
Practice for you not to get swept away in the pace of whoever you're interviewing.

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:14.500
Wow, Ai-chan, your... How do I say this?

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.960
Like, your aura... your aura...

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:18.900
What is this aura of yours?

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:20.140
I'm just so surprised.

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.280
So surprised your ears grew!

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:27.200
This AI knows so much about the human world!

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:29.760
It feels like we're approaching a singularity.

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.560
Do you know what a singularity is, Ai-chan?

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:32.060
I do.

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:33.520
I googled it.

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.460
Oh you googled it (laughs)

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.120
What'd Google say?

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.780
Umm

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.060
What was it? (laughs)

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:43.600
Oh but uhh, yeah!

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.460
I was like "oh, this is definitely me!"

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:48.440
Like um, you have the latest technology

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:50.200
And then you exceed even that.

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.480
Is what was written, I think.

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:54.980
So basically, yeah, me!

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.500
Yep.

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:56.820
You totally dodged the question.

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:59.080
You totally did.

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:01.140
Oh but this is, you know,

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:03.940
This is for all the kids watching out there.

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:05.000
What for, you ask?

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:09.560
Rather than listening to someone talk about it, you remember it better when you look it up yourself.

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:10.780
Do you get it?

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:13.100
You sure can adapt to the situation well, as an AI.

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:16.120
So then it should say something like, "look it up later!" around here.

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:17.700
So then it should say something like, "look it up later!" around here.
[look "singularity" up on Google!]

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:19.100
Don't forget.

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:19.600
That's right.

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:22.580
"Singularity" is a keyword for Ai-chan.

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:24.440
So everyone, make sure you look it up.

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.640
Okay?

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:28.580
Panora: She's not just about being cute, okay?
Ai: (Though I personally don't know what it means)

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:33.740
Could you point out what parts of you that you think are cute?

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.380
Well, number one would be

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:40.220
Physically, it would be my big, round eyes.

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:43.600
And this! Doesn't it grab your attention?

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:44.420
You did mention it earlier.

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:45.560
It moves.

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.700
Panora: It's wiggling.
Ai: Yes it is.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.500
I'd love to make this into an actual product and have everyone wear it!

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:54.280
So it's all about the money.

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:55.300
Panora: So it's all about the money.
Ai: There's so many Ai-chans!

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:56.320
It's really about money, isn't it?

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:58.940
I want everyone to cosplay it in real life!

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:01.860
Won't someone do it?

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:04.320
But well, in terms of fans...

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.220
A lot of them are men.

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:08.840
So if you went to an event with actual cosplayers...

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:11.080
It might look like a scene out of hell.

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:12.340
That's nasty!

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:17.360
Considering you, Ai-chan, it would be nice for everyone to get together in VR to do VR cosplay.

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:19.360
So everyone is Ai-chan!

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:20.920
Yes, like, look for the real Ai-chan!

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:22.920
Ai-chan on the stage, and Ai-chan in the audience.

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:23.620
Oh~!

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:25.080
But everyone's souls are different.

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:27.060
For actual cosplay...

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:29.180
Guys can do it.

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:30.660
Really, you can.

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:33.380
But I'd like to see actual cute cosplay, so girls, please!

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:37.200
I'm serious.

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:39.220
Well then, for 2017

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:41.800
let's hope your costume becomes popular in the real world.

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:45.740
Like, that place in Ariake in the summer.

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:47.080
Ariake in summer?

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:48.020
Comiket!

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:50.020
Wait, it's not Makuhari?

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:51.880
Wait a minute...

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:54.420
Wait, no cut. Cut that all out, cut!

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:56.260
Summer Comiket!

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:57.780
NatsuComi!

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:00.340
Lots of Ai-chan in natsucomi!

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:02.800
You totally dodged the topic again!

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:05.300
Well, Ai-chan

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:06.560
you've done a lot of stuff, but...

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:09.520
Do you have any goals or ideas for the future?

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:11.880
What I'd like to be?

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:14.300
It's still a little vague at this point, but

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:16.620
For starters, as I've said many times before,

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:18.480
I want to connect with a lot of people.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.880
And to that end, I need to have a lot of people know who I am.

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:26.820
So of course, I need to become more popular as a YouTuber.

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:30.040
And as I've said in my introduction video,

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:31.940
I want to star in a commercial!

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:36.000
TV is really big, it's really important!

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.380
Are you watching, any big shots out there? How about it?

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:41.180
You really are scheming...

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:42.080
Not at all!

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:43.380
I'm pure as white!

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:45.380
Well, this space sure is.

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:46.540
So are my clothes!

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:47.320
That they are.

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:48.300
And so is my stomach.

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:50.300
Funny! You're so funny, Ai-chan!

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:51.920
You really should get out more often.

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:56.240
Like in "Tetsuko's Room", they call over Doraemon, right?

00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:59.700
So something like that.

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:01.820
Show up at Tetsuko's place.

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:03.680
I'd prefer to go to Matsuko's instead!

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:05.300
Ah, Matsuko's.

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:05.860
Yes.

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:08.720
Like, the Monday Late Show.
(Getsuyou kara Yofukashi)

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:12.340
Ai-chan, don't you know a little too much about the human world?

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:14.600
Or Matsuko's Meeting.
(Matsuko Kaigi)

00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:17.820
Uhhh, well um...

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:19.280
You watch quite a lot of TV.

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:21.160
I do. I sure do.

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:23.540
Gathering material is important.

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:27.180
You can be a sponsor of mine if you want, VR geezer!

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:28.740
VR geezer?

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:30.340
Maybe do some crowdfunding?

00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:31.500
Ah, I'd love to!

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:33.800
Like, if you donate this amount of money

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:34.380
-Like, if you donate this amount of money
-If you do...?

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:36.620
You can get this Ai-chan thing (bow).

00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:39.100
Ahh, I'd love to do that, make it a product.

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:40.180
Oh, and a figure!

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:41.980
Ah, a figure would be nice.

00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:44.220
Though isn't a 3D figure good enough?

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:45.460
3D figure?

00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:47.460
Ah sorry, I mean 3D data of a figure.

00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:49.080
3D data...

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:51.080
Ahhh, I get it, I get it.

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:54.700
Like, playing with you in a VR space and all.

00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:56.700
But the actual thing would be nice.

00:07:58.320 --> 00:07:59.500
Even though you're AI?

00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:04.540
If it was VR, there are still people who don't have (the peripherals).

00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:09.560
So I'd like for people to really, physically be able to see it.

00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:11.980
Weeeeell now! Really!

00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:13.180
Wow!

00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:14.460
Wow!

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:16.040
Nice vocabulary!

00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:16.860
Vocabulary?

00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:20.720
I've really lost my grasp of vocabulary here.

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:23.520
Maybe it's because I got hit earlier?

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:25.720
Uhhh, how do I say this?

00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:27.580
My body's all weird too.

00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:29.700
It feels like I'm bugging out or something

00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:31.800
Ah that's true.

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:33.800
Maybe I went too far?

00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:35.640
I think you did. Probably.

00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:39.560
The next time you call someone over, maybe do it a little more gently?

00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:40.960
More gently?

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:43.820
Ah! You mean like putting that stuff on a handkerchief?

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:46.820
Let's go with that.

00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:51.220
Wow uhhh...

00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:53.460
You sure know a lot about the real world.

00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:54.640
Yes!

00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:55.600
Where'd you learn about that?

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:56.260
From TV!

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:57.260
TV!

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:58.140
Detective Conan!

00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:01.420
Wow, you're a (virtual) YouTuber, yet you watch TV and stuff.

00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:02.980
Of course I do!

00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:03.660
