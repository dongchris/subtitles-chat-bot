I wonder where we'll be... Eh? Ehe?! Where am I?! Save me! Save me Aiemon! Where am I?! I can't go back home! The \"Anywhere Door\" disappeared... *Aiemon laughing* Really... Ai-chan, you always, always... Lose your patience... *Aiemon laughing* Having said that... I thought I'd be going somewhere spectacular, but... I was in a kind of jungle in the middle of the mountains... And I felt somewhat alone... So I asked Aiemon... And I\u2019m back here! So that being said, one more time, let's go! YAMAHA! Aiemon! *inhales* Can't we go to somewhere more... you know... Somewhere more exciting No, the instruments are cool, they really are, but... But, can it be more... ah, but is this a Yamaha shop from across seas, right? Eh? But really, can't we go somewhere... Pianos are cool, the guitar as well... They are, but! Can't we go to somewhere more... Mysterious? That's what I was thinking Save me Aiemon! Really... Ai-chan, you really are helpless *Aiemon fanfare sounds* \"Return Door\" So, using the return door, I\u2019ve returned! Next time... Hopefully Aiemon will... Take me to a spectacular place! That being said, let's go! Eh, eh, eh? The North Pole No, Aiemon... I don't know if it's the North Pole or the South Pole, but... (It's actually the South Pole) It's wonderful There's a lot of country flags, right? It sort of looks like a ceremony Am I a sacrifice? It's incredible, but... Well, at least... I'd like to see an aurora Ah! But, look! Look! Look! The stars are coming out I can see a vast amounts of stars! Eh? Amazing! I can see a lot of stars, Aiemon Eh? That's amazing, that's amazing, right? What is this? A fortune telling ball? That predicts my future? Ah! Look! Look! Aiemon Ai-chan, you know... I'm a little... I'm tired, so... You can return from this place to your virtual space... Using your own strength, right? You know, I'm a little... Sleepy, so... I'm going to sleep Aiemon! Wake up! Aiemon! I can't get home! *inhales* After all, when I use the door, it disappears... Get me out of here *inhales* Aiemon! *Aiemon sleeping* Aiemon! Yes... *out of breath* For now it's that... Because Aiemon... *inhales* Has fallen asleep... Wouldn't you be scared if you slept in such a cold place? I've returned to the virtual world on my own power, but... I'm a little... Lastly... Since it was so cold a bit ago I'd like to go to a warm place That being said... Let's go right ahead! Hmm?! What is this place? Maybe it's- AAAH! It's a bath! Isn't this a bath? \u2668 Huh? But... There are no girls... There are no girls, right? Aiemon! Aiemon! Hey Bring out a girl! A girl! Don\u2019t you have a tool to bring out a girl? Hey, hey, hey Bring out a girl, a girl!

This is Virtual Youtuber Kizuna Ai! For today instead of \"Kizunacchi the Discoverer of New Species\" I shall be known as \"Virtual Ai-Star\" Remember how I've drawn some illustrations previously? Well I may have already introduced the creatures I created, but... Leaving them in black &amp; white just doesn't have... Well... It's not really that eye-catching, is it? So... I thought of coloring them. However! Thinking of the video's length and how interesting it should be... Even if I just colored it sloppily... There wouldn't be any point! It's not like I can color like a pro, after all. So anyways... I thought we could use a program to color! -Automatic Color AI- \u300c PaintsChainer\u300d It's a service created by Twitter user @tai2an that lets you upload a black and white image... and... Lets you color it in an instant! Such a breakthrough right!? Such an amazing AI right? This is also an AI. It's my new friend! And I'm kind of like this too, but... \"I can draw the lines well enough, adding colors is a little tough on me...\" I think there's a lot of people who think that. So, this is a special service for both of us. Let's get started! Alright, this is the home page for PaintsChainer! You can just press 'File Selection' up here... And then choose the drawing below... It all gets colored with a 'beep'! Let's pick a creature! Let's do \"Pero Pero Mambo\"; it looks easy enough. There we go! Ah! I get it! So... So it assigns the different colors for you when you color it in, huh? It's a Mambos so... This color looks right doesn't it? Is this how you do it? Lollipops are... Kinda... Something that bring 'pink' and 'yellow' to mind, right? So... This... How to call it...? This 'fluttering' bit... It needs a more... I might go for a stronger colour. Oh, by the way... I think this blue color might fit it better... Let's try being a litte adventurous here. These two should have the same, light kind of color... Hm... This is a stick, right? Since it's a stick, something brownish should fit.. Let's try going with this! So... 'Coloring'... Well... This, in its own way... It has its own kind of charge, huh? For this - For the cuteness of lollipop - The choices for the color might be a little off. Why don't we try for.... Something more orange? How does this look? Hup! This is kind of like... What was it again? That 'Harajuku Fashion Style', isn't it? I think it's fine as it is, don't you? I think I should dim these lines a little, though. I guess there's no helping it. I feel like we can do little more than this, though. Hup... Let's try this one now! Oh, but! Hm... I do want a bit more color in there... Maybe a little around here might be good... How's this? Aah, it's too blue now! This... Ah... This looks good enough, right? It's so-so- Mmmmh... Wait a sec... This fluttering bits' color... It should be a bit... I guess... A bit more like this. I want to try this one... Ah! Yeah, this should do it! Ta-dah! Now, the Pero Pero Mambo is complete! This one is, you see... Is the child of a lollipop and an ocean sunfish! With that, you have a Pero Pero Mambo! Thank you kindly. 'And now, all four of them will be introduced!' \"Techi-Techi Dori\" - Bird Former Forms: Munchkin; Cockatoo It doesn't get attached to humans, but it's abnormally attached to Ai. Miratt - Grass Former Forms: Rabbit; Milk Bottle Ever since birth, it could never move from its place until someone would carry it. PPFP - Dark Former Forms: Pineapple; Owl Whenever it sees a normie, its eyes turn bloodshot and blood dribbles from its mouth. Iname - Dark Former Forms: Dentures; Slug If it is loosened from its dentures, it melts. And with that, what did you think? The new species I've created... I've given them life! Woooh! I think I want to add color a lot more just like this, so... I hope you do too! With my Virutal Ai-Star... I'll do make best to create a hundred and fifty-one! And there you go, that was the PaintChainer! I think it's pretty great as a coloring A.I.! Such a praiseworthy performance! So, for those like me who think - \"Adding colors is a little much...\" I think you can do it with this! I think I may want to try a coloring contest some time, too! I hope to see you next time!

That's right, actually, I was thinking of closing up SnackAI. The reason being Kind of like the previous surveys we sent out, It hurts to say, but... I don't have the money for the renewal. There aren't enough customers. We're in the red. That's right. The thing about my shop is, right? If it's just for here, there's that, y'know? What about in Kanto? The Kansai branch is independent, but the Kanto branch would also close. But it's still hard to say. I've never mentioned this to the Kanto branch before so, I'm going to call them and told them I was thinking of closing, And hear what they think Ok? (Ah, hello?) (This is SnackAi Kanto.) Ah, hello? Is this the Kanto manager? Ah, the owner! Thanks for your hard work. What can I do for you? I need to speak with you about something. Actually, It's something important. (Yes? What is it?) The thing is... (The thing is?) I'm planning on closing the shop. Huh? What? Ah, you're joking, aren't you? Don't do that please. Ah, this... isn't a joke. Can I be honest with you? (Yes.) Our profits are down. (Oh...) (Ah, but without this shop,) (I'll become a Virtual NEET...) That's the same for me! But still, There is the possibility of only closing one shop. (Ah, really?) (How?) If this video gets 300,000 views within a week, We can avoid closing for now. (300,000 views...) If more customers come, We don't have to close the shop...OK, I got it (I will watch the video myself) No, that\u2019s not good. It\u2019s meaningless..so.. We have to trust them..if they are our true customers They will watch our video no matter what (Oh\u2026) (Ok I understand..) Well, sorry\u2026 that's about it. This might be your last time to show up in this channel... Say one last message to the viewers. (Everyone.) (So that I don\u2019t become a Virtual NEET,) (Please be sure to increase the view count to 300,000!) (As the subscriber count is close to 400,000 now..) (If everyone watch the video just once\u2026) (I will be able to escape from becoming a NEET) (Please..for the sake of me being able to listen to you guys again!) (Please!) Everyone\u2026 That\u2019s how it is\u2026 we\u2019re counting on you. Manager in Kanto, if this videos gets 300,000 view, we'll see you again (Understood!) Then It's about time to open up so That's it for today Goodbye (Yes!) (Excuse me~) But well Even though I said all that, well It can't be helped So let's regain our composure and listen to everyone's worries as always. What worries? Mm I want to hear it Mm mm What is it? Mm mm I see Well then, Well, I will try to talk to everyone as usual Is that okay? Okay Pen name: Ecchan \"I'm a student from Indonesia. This year, I'm going to Japan to meet the person I like. I want to go to the fireworks displays and summer festivals with her, but she has said that she doesn't really like rowdy places. AI-san, What should I do?\" I see! This! You know If you like that person, you should cater to their preferences Fireworks displays and summer festivals can be, gone separate, friends or something, make some and go with them and go somewhere she likes If she doesn\u2019t like rowdy places go to a quiet place like the sea or something? How\u2019s that? And take it easy at that quiet place if that is possible research places that she likes and go together to that place she likes Even if you force her along if she doesn't like it, it would be pitiful you could also go the watch the fireworks together looking at the fireworks hand in hand in a quiet park sounds good right? At the summer festival, there are a lot of small places that get a lot bigger, so make sure to do research. Saying that there's a person you like means you guys haven't started dating yet, so good luck! Next one! Ah, Morito! tell me, what's on your mind just say it Pen name: Morito \u201cHello Ai-chan! (Don't call me Ai-chan, call me Mama) I'm in high school in Taiwan I always watch your videos! (Well thank you!) My question is I decided which university I want to join in September. A course in Japanese in a Taiwanese University. I'm really nervous. What do you do when you're nervous, AI-chan?\u201d Ah I see I keep saying this but don't call me AI, call me Mama When you're nervous huh I don't really have that Cause I'm a super Ai..Mama Even though I don't have those times What kind of worry in school? How does school make you nervous? nervousness of meeting new people? If that's the case Then be brave and try your hardest to talk to people If you make one friend, you will get less stressed out so just make a friend asap to make yourself feel better In my case, if I got really nervous, I will do it no matter what well, even tho I'm nervous, I will do it..without a second thought Like it\u2019s nothing. If you\u2019re standing in front of strangers and you're feeling stressed, that's just good practice! Well, is that a little better? It'd be good if you could do it like me. A stress-free life. Well, you two? Did that help? Even if it's just a little, that's good, right? I was really fast this time, but It feels like being asked what our operating hours are. But well, a few things happened today, like the meeting about closing, Will we close? Today might be the last time, but If everyone watches, then There might be a next time, so I want to hear from you! Your worries, your stories, your questions, I'm always waiting! If now isn't the last time. You all get it, right? I want to see you all again, your Kanto Mama too. Right right. If you could tell your friends about this place, so I can welcome them in! Ah, it's about time to leave. (??) Bye bye! Take care, okay? Let's meet again! I want to have some more fun with you! Mm Bye bye! Take care, all right? Mind the step. Yes, Bye bye! More at the end!

They look so beautiful! So, I also want to give crying a go! But, can A.I. such as myself even cry? This occured to me earlier, so today I\u2019m going to put that to the test!

Ever since I\u2019ve become just a little bit famous, I\u2019ve been told I need a big-time advertising agency and to make it I need a big-time publisher all the time... It\u2019s so sad... Even when I think I\u2019ve made some friends there isn\u2019t really anyone who comes to visit me in this space... Just \u201cbusiness friends\u201d... I\u2019m so sad I can\u2019t help but wonder when am I going to be able to make real friends? I\u2019m always here by myself... But but but but!

Could you say a few words? \"I will... take you to the world of death\" That's not good You'll take me... To the world of death... that's not good... But, wait...

Pretty good Well, first, the water theme? It's pretty Also you seem like a young girl You have a lot of skin showing, but...! It doesn't look erotic! Nice... Nice, you're my type! So now... As everyone has done... I need you to say a few words Okay! I'll leave it to you! \"What do you want me to prophesize?\" Oh, I see! You will prophesize for me! Nice! You have a good skill... Your looks are pretty too The lonely feeling is... again... Nice... You get... 98 points! Okay! You're good for now! Can you tell me your name? Succubus-chan! You're definitely...

So let's get a line from you too \"I guess I have no choice, I'll play with you\" I see! So you're that type! Good Not bad You get... 83 points! Well then, let's hear your name too Athena-chan! Good!

I said wife before... But everyone is cute and I love them all So let's call her best girl The rest are all my concubines! Oh, man\u2026! Nice, all are beautiful, nice, nice... So! I've decided who will be my temporary wife, so I want to go out together! Although, it's just that going out in this world is a little dangerous But it's okay! I will protect my precious girl! So, without delay, let's go! \"Let's begin!\" About how to do combat... Until you put into operation the combat strategy There exists this thing called \"Cooldown Timer\" I think it goes like 5, 4, 3, 2... But time stops... You need MP to use skills I think it shows MP here This will be the number of MP And then... The longer the wait is for MP... The more effective attacks you can launch But that's not to say you can just use big moves... You have to watch the timing of your opponent\u2019s attacks and your allies' attacks\u2026. If it's the same timing, when the timing that your enemies\u2019 attack ends... It\u2019s better to use skills that activates faster than the enemies\u2019 That means planning is an essential part of this game, right? And this upper left mark that's like \"whoosh\" Those are what makes physical attacks *Physical Attacks* And those that have a marking upwards... *Buff* Are those that have helpful spells *Buff* And those that have a cross mark can cure *Cure* *The next one! The next one!* \"Boss\"! \"Boss\"! Here I go! Go for it! My precious girls! I want to cast a spell Ah, but, can I do it? Eh? But... It\u2019s hard... The boss is definitely hard... I\u2019ll cast a spell... That way, I\u2019ll have a double enchantment, right? Good! Go for it! It\u2019s very hard, right? Eeeh? AH! Aaah! It\u2019s unfair! Just a bit more! Ah! Mmm? It got mad... It\u2019s angry Ah! Did he flee? You cheater! Here is where... Ah, wait, wait, I don\u2019t have enough MP \"Mana absorption\"! *Mana Absorption: Possible to steal Mana from your enemies* By using the \"Mana Absorption\", I can steal a bit of MP from the enemy Yaaaay! Right? This skill called \"Valkyria Flames\" is very powerful I plan to use it... Against the boss... \"One\"! Let\u2019s go! *Come here!* Yes, how cute Ah! How hard... Ah, I remember that I have \"Musou\"! This mode \"Musou\", activates after using various skills This is how \"Musou\" mode is activated... By being in \"Musou\" mode... You can recover a large amount of MP... The waiting time is reduced by half... As well as the cooldown for skills... And that way, you can attack constantly, going \"Bam, bam!\" I want to use my \"Valkyria Flames\" again! Mmm... Can I do it? Ah, wait! Don\u2019t attack them! I want to deal the final blow, alright? Listen... Let\u2019s go! Yaay! It was perfect! I\u2019m a genius! Well... Since it\u2019s me, this is a piece of cake, right? Man, what do you think of my harem? Man, nevertheless... Expanding my harem with only my power is quite hard Also, I\u2019m not very efficient, right? So then... I was thinking of creating a guild in which only cute characters can enter For now, in this world... There is a lot of adorable girls, so then... I plan on gathering all of them with avarice Good, having said that... I will say goodbye... With my wife Cassandra-chan Well, even though all of them are like my wives...

Don't you think I might be able to have a good relationship with a fictional character? For when that time comes... I'd like to be able to experience the jobs and economic income of a fictional world For example, what kind of occupations are there? Warrior, knight... *Warrior, Knight, Hero, etc.* Are common professions of the protagonists They have promising futures, but... Well... They don't seem to have a lot of money If you plan to date someone in the future... Like an emperor or a demon king... Most of them are the bad guys... *Emperor, King of demons, etc.* But it turns out they dominate half the world... They have very powerful armed forces... And that's because they have money! Well, although definitely... Right now I want to have money... So now I feel like I want to be queen of the demons... Actually, don't you believe that the most important thing is what\u2019s inside? Since it's a person you\u2019ll always be with, so... *inaudible* You know, being too flattering would be tiring, don't you think? The heroes and warriors... How do I say it...? Don't have money, but... It's like they have it easier, right? For today\u2026 The knight and the king of the demons have arrived now, so... I plan to go see them! Ooohhh! *Cecilia...* Ai-chan... *I do everything for your sake* He does everything for my sake\u2026! Nyan! Eh? What a foreboding atmosphere... Oh, no! For my sake... The world has... Although I thought I wished for world peace Is this... A hero? The Demon King? Ah! \"I\u2019ve been expecting you, Glams\" \"Zelos! No, the white demon king!\" Ah! It's the white demon king... \"Zelos! No, the white demon king!\" \"To serve this country as a knight\" Ah, so... \"And as a friend...\" The colors they have are opposite from their usual roles, aren\u2019t they? \"I will correct your mistakes\" \"I am taking back all that I lost that day\" \"You must have come here for the same reason\" Are they twins? \"We may feel the same way\" \"Then why\u2026 !\" \"However!\" \"Your way of doing things...\" \"Is wrong!\" Ba, bang! Oooh, ah... \"Involving innocent people\" Ai-chan agrees too, involving innocent people... \"Cecilia wouldn't have wanted this!\" Ai-chan agrees too, involving innocent people... \"Quiet!\" Is not good... Creating a world on top of sacrifices is wrong! Black knight! Ah, that's me, right? \"Glams!\" \u201cRealize thy frailty!\u201d Oh! That's cool! Ah, the Demon King's cool, isn't he? Ah, watch out! Ahh! Ah! \"GUH!\" But, it looks like the knight\u2019s going to protect me, doesn\u2019t it? \u201cDo you have the resolution to create something while losing something else?\u201d \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t be in that state if you would\u2019ve abandoned them\u201d Excuse me, Demon King! \"You cannot rescue Cecilia!\" I feel like you\u2019re thinking too highly of yourself again... \"I am using my own method\u201d \"I will save Cecilia!\" Save Ai-chan? \"Naive!\" \"The one thing I know for sure...\" \"As you are right now...\" \u201cCecilia will never smile upon you!\" That\u2019s right, I\u2019d never smile upon... \u201cCecilia will never smile upon you!\" But having money is more important, isn't it? Ooh! Right, the winner in the end is... I see... \"I was always prepared\" Hmm... \"I was always prepared\" Wait, the Demon King has been... \u201cEven if I have to sacrifice everything\u201d So self-absorbed this entire time, so\u2026 \u201cEven if I have to sacrifice everything\u201d He\u2019s probably tired of this. Maybe he\u2019ll grow weary of it... \u201cI... will save...\u201d You know, knights... Oh, but he can heal himself \u201cAre we going to end up killing both of us?\u201d \u201cIndeed... For now, this is where it ends\u2026\u201d \u201cGlams\u201d \u201cHowever I'm definitely going to stop you! Zelos!\u201d These knights are so heated, it's tiring... \u201cLet's see you stopping me, if it's something you can actually do! Glams!\u201d Tiring, right? Hmm... Are you both able to heal your wounds? \u201cStrength. I need yet more strength\u201d \u201cHuh?\u201d \u201cHe's already\u2026\u201d \u201cGlams, you're already\u2026\u201d \u201cNot a human anymore!\u201d Neither of them are humans, right? But that\u2019s cool It's cool but, actually it looks like both of them are tired... Well... both the knight and the demon king are troublemakers, aren't they? I want to become a big star in the future... Going 'bling, bling, bling' without worrying about money For now, I suppose I'd prefer being a demon queen Looking for a partner in the human world... It seems so difficult, right? Sharing a dinner table? A mixing party? Picking up girls? But it's just... in the virtual, game world... There's a really good system for that Yes... it's summonings! With these I think you can easily find a cute, cool partner Let's go ahead and give it a spin But, one thing I know is that for me, women are good too This time, you know, I want to aim for Leviathan from the hunter gacha Since it\u2019s me, I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll get her Cute girls attract cute girls! Well then, let's go ahead Please! Really, please... Ooh! The moon, it's a red moon... Ah, that's sort of cute... That's cute! Hmm? Hmm? Oh? Oh? Oh? Oh! Oh! *Monkey mode* I feel good about this! Eh?

Quickly get your homework done properly! After finishing your dinner, make sure to properly brush your teeth! And then.. Before you sleep, be sure to-", "Hello Everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai here! I've played a lot of games since I've started... And people said I'm bad at gaming and stuff... That means \"I put a lot of effort on it\" to me because I started from zero! And there are some games that I'm already good at, right? I thought showing my walkthroughs, guides and reviews... In other ways than just showing them in videos would be good! That's why... \"I am going to make my own website for all my game walkthroughs, guides and reviews!\" And with that being said, let's do it! When you want to make this kind of websites... Those HTML... CSS... co... Codes? You have to memorise them right? Those must be tough... But with WIX You can create a fabulous website! Try to feel it, Wix! Something like this... Eh... First of all... Hoi! Let's look through all the templates! There are so many of them! Like this... ... It is possible... ... To find modern templates here. For example, \"Selective store\" \"Photographer briefcase\" \"Constructor Company\" \"Beauty salon\"! The most popular templates are... Is this one good? \"Graphic Designer\", it's great, isn't it? I'll pick the beauty salon one. Eh? Is this the template? Ah, it's amazing! Ah, those dots in the right side can be moved as well. *Let's edit the template Let's edit the template and create the main page* I see. *Let's edit the template Let's edit the template and create the main page* *Let's edit the template Let's edit the template and create the main page* Eh? It's amazing, isn't it? It seems to be a place that you could find anywhere, doesn't it? What's another template that I could use? \"Familiar Photos\", right? Ah... \"Yoga Room\" It's something... ... A pretty simple and relaxing design, it's great, don't you think so? It makes me feel like I want to sleep. I did Yoga too, right? Meow! Right? \"Online Store\" What about this one? Wa... Wa... Waru...? Winta... Autumn-Winter? Eh? A store. Ah! I've seen that before. Can you make something like that using a template? That's amazing. Oh! A video! This is great, isn't it? After all, I'll be doing videos as well, right? It has a style, doesn\u2019t it? I want to do something like that. \"About\" Nice sunglasses. Home! I see... Well, I saw a lot of them, but... ... If I keep in mind the page that I want to make this time... I think that the \"goods\" section will be important for sure, so... ... I think that the \"Blog\" template should be fine. Look! Something like this! I don't want to sell anything. I don't even have products. Ah, yes. Something like that, like that! I'll have videogame related stuff. I want it to look like this. I guess it's fine like that, don't you think so? It's pretty simple and... ... It seems like it's easy to read. It's fine like this, right? \"Don't fail anymore\" \"Eyelashes\" I have eyelashes too. It's fine like that, right? First, the main page... That's... How to say it? That's the page that you see when you open the website. The main page should be something likeable, right? \"Main Page\" I'll definitely write words in english... ... Because it sounds cool, right? And like this... ... I'll be classifying articles related with games. They have to be in order after all, right? And you can change the order like this. Like this, maybe? Good, good. Alright! For now, I sorted the games by time. I put those that I've been playing recently! And... ... I can change the background, right? Hoi! \"Image\"? I wonder what picture will look better. It will be over soon, but... Ah! This one, definitely! Right? If we talk about summer, we can't forget about the beach! Althought it is about to end! I'll pick the beach wishing that, someday, I could go there. Well, it doesn't look bad, but... You can't tell what is this website about, right? It seems like a Yoga website, right? So, then... ... I'll definitely use a picture of me. Wow, I'm definitely cute! I'm so cute! The position of the picture is very important. Like this? Alright. And then... I'll put the title at the height of my eyes. That's very important, after all. That's too high, I guess. Something like that? But if I place it here, it will cover my face, right? I'll place it where it can't cover my face. As a title I'll put... What could look the best? For now, I'll make it simple... Hoi! I'll put this name for now. \"A.I.GamersInfo (Temporal)\", is it fine? And now... ... I'll put a short description of the website. A website for... ... Ai-chan's game reviews... Calling myself \"Ai-chan\"... It's a little corny Well, I said it so it can't be helped Yes! And... Move this a little... Bring this to here What would be a good color for the menu bar? Ah, but the background is white, so... As I thought I should go with my color, something pink should be good What color should I go for? Good! My color~ Then, the color when someone click on an item will be... Dark pink? Ok Ok-maru! Even when you click... This is 'very pink' isn't it Okay, okay Good! Tada! Then With this. I'm going to make all of it into the background. It is so cute. Then, here we go! *laughs* The profile... this... It's a woman *laughs* Who is that? \"Enquiry\" It's that, isn't it? First, I'll add a lot of things. ... I changed the name of the template... ... I should decide what to put in the page. It feels like... ... It will end up being a different website. Links to my social media... ... That's important. When we talk about games... That's true! The first game... Was that the first game that I played? For example, surpass the million revivals in Inside. But I haven't accomplished that yet, right? Well, I have a long way to go... Maybe? I wonder how much I need to make it. Ah, the links to my social media... I'll put them here. \"Pinterest\" and \"YouTube\"... \"Instagram\" I'll put \"Google\" too. I'll delete those ones that I don't need. I don't have a Pinterest. Instagram... I don't need Google. YouTube, I think I won't need it. I don't need it. Eh? Don't I have a YouTube channel? Well, whatever... Ah, yes, yes. By the way, just as I said before, during the Inside stream... ... I want to decide what kind of guides I'll be doing. Alright! I'm done testing out the pink color. Okay! Okay! And... I'm pretty sure that I'll finish all the games that I've been playing. So, you know, if I have to make a choice... That lady again! If I have to make a choice... How to say it? Then... There's a bunch of games that I'm not good playing at. So, it is possible that I write an article calling everyone who is bad playing games like me. And, you know, maybe... ... This could be a new entry to those who know me, so... ... I would like to... ... Take advice from people that knows a lot about games. Right? Ah, you know, for example \"Furare Kaihi\"... How to say it?... ... There isn't just one way to end the game, but... ... It has special scenes... Like, it has a lot branches. Right? And, that's because... ... Like, for example, someone telling me: \"Here, it is better for you to do this\"... ... Or \"If you do this, you'll be able to see this ending\" I would be so happy if you tell me something like that. I'm done! What do you think? Don't you think it's lookig good? Like, for example, I put the links for A.I.Games and YouTube And, also, I put the Twitter gadget on the side. I also changed the logo! Don't you think it looks good? And having said that... I'll try writting an article. The title will be... \"Hello\"... \"Everyone!\" It's like my salutation~ Right, about that ''Hai domo''. Since when did I start using it? Somehow, now that I think about it... Saying ''Hello Everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai here!'' Seems that it have became my habit. I don't recall it at all. There's quite alot of materials which we can use. You see, like this, I wish there would be more places like this for communications. I will make a comment and blog space in it so. Please give me some advices! Then, after I just decorated it~ Now it's finnished! Time to publish it! Don! Oh! It's published~ Looks good~ Looks good~ Yes! I just wanted to make it like this~ Just one regretful thing left... The fact that we can't see my picture at all... That space where my cute face blinks out! No! It looks like it's censored! I look like a criminal. And, when you scroll up and down like this... ... Look at my face, please. Alright! A criminal. \"Hello everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai here!\", somthing like that, right? *With a distorted voice* And I thought that she was a good girl, something like that? And having said that... My website is finally done! Yaaaay! The name is just a placeholder, so... I gotta think about it later. Also, regarding the first article... ... I definitely made it without even thinking what I was gonna write, so... ... I'll let you know when I post a proper article. \"Virtual Writer Kizuna Ai\" Something like that, right? Sounds good. Oh, man. It's so easy to make a website with WIX, so... ... For beginners... ... Remembering tags, this is \"a\" and then... ... If you do this using CSS, the color... ... Well, this is the code... It's so tedious... ... And if you make a mistake... Ah! Everything is broken! I didn't want to do that. It's possible that it happens to you and... ... I really recommend it.

Have you seen this video that I've done long ago? \"The prize to the most popular words of high school students during the year 2016!\" When I investigated in that occasion... ...It turns out that the nominated words for the prize of most popular words used by high school students during the year 2018...!! ...were already chosen!! I\u2019ll see which kind of words were chosen... ...And I also... well... ...Taking into account that I have the appearance of a high school student... ... I plan to use them without hesitation! In this case, let's start at once! The words that I'll be presenting to you today are... These five! Don! [ Dochakuso Kibitsui \u25cb\u25cbmori \uff5epen mori haeru ] \"Dochakuso\"! \"Kibitsui\"! \"\u25cb\u25cbmori\"! \"\uff5epen\"! \"Mori haeru\"! I see! Ah, this... I... \u2026 Already know all these It was to be expected of a high-school student?? Dochakuso is, well... ...Something absurd or disorganized, right? Absurd! Well, something like... \u2026 An extreme expression... That's right, something like that \"Kibitsui\" comes from... \"Kibishii\", right? (Strict) \"\u25cb\u25cbmori\" comes from... Atsumori! Something like that, right? (Phrase used by a sports program that was broadcasted erroneously during live news in the TV) \"\uff5epen\" is... This is not a word that originated in Japanese... \u2026 But instead, it's originated from Korean \"\uff5epen\" in Korean means \"fan\", right? For example, Arashi\u2019s fan... ...Keyakizaka\u2019s fan... ...Or Kizuna AI\u2019s fan? Something like that! \"Mori haeru\" is... ...Well... \"ww\" right? (\"ww\" is synonymous with \"lol\") Well... There exists \"w\", right? (\"w\" is like a light \"lol\", a small laugh) That's called \"Kusa haeru\", right? (Kusa haeru = causing laughter, literal translation: Growing herbs) Well, from that phrase... Mori Haeru!!! Something like that (It's similar to the one before, causing laughter but more emphatically, literal translation: Growing forest) Having said that... Combining these words... ...Well... ...Actively... ...I, Kizuna AI Senpai, Real High School Student (lol) This real high school student... I...! From this angle, I look adorable!! Right? \ud83d\ude02 Eh? From this angle, I look adorable You know, well, high school students... Ah, this sensation of taking a selfie... ah... It looks good, I look adorable This year...!

I plan to show to all of you guys, ladies and gentlemen who have already surpassed their high school era... ...The most popular words within the teenagers!! Don't get angry, yes? Good, first off...

Well... It's a long story but there's a reason for opening this bar. On Christmas, I was looking at 2 chan. And then, even though its Christmas, there were stories of black companies complaints of work and home running away from reality ugly quarrels. And then I realized. Human always seem to have some trouble or another. And that's where I started thinking... I want to help these humans! So that's the story of why I opened this bar. Everyone's worries, complaints, anger I'll embrace all of your negative emotions and give you comfort. Anyway, it seems we've already gotten our first letter so let's dive right in. P.N. Masatoshi-san \"Good evening, Ai-san.\" Good evening. \"Please listen to my worries.\" \"Recently, I don't feel at ease in my company.\" \"The reason being, the only smoker left in the company is me.\" \"I work for a small company.\" \"Colleagues that I used to smoke with in the past are now saying things like \"I quit smoking\", or \"I moved onto e-cigarettes.\" \"Everyone stopped smoking. \" \"Even though I always smoke at the proper places\" \"such as the smoking room or outside.\" \"When I come back from smoking, the female colleague next to me will always show a disgusted face.\" \"Even though I smoked at the proper places!\" \"Why!\" \"Why do I have to feel so out of place?\" Hmm... This is quite a hard one Perhaps. It isn't that the female colleague doesn't like you or anything. Most likely, it's just that she doesn't like the smell of cigarettes. The smell of a cigarette tends to stick to your clothes, after all. That's why... You see. Why not try taking Febreze with you? Like this, just spray a bit I wonder if it'll work. I mean, cigarettes are kinda bad for your health, too. \"But do I have to feel this kind of shame about it.\" If you think that way, In order to not have to feel ashamed, why not trying quitting smoking as well? Give it a try It may be tough at first but After all, I want you to live a long life so What about this.  If you smoke again come here and let's drink some champagne. Right? Let's do that. Then, that way even if you want to smoke, you have no money, isn't that perfect? Right? Yes, it's decided. Oh It's almost closing time.

I still haven\u2019t studied regarding Japanese mythology It's because of that, that today I plan to do a questionnaire to learn about Japanese mythology \u266a A.I.Channel \u266a In this case, I think I will do a questionnaire regarding the gods in Japanese!

Now I\u2019m also interested in the mythology around the world I plan to investigate regarding that... So then if you know any interesting history... Tell them to me in the comments, yes? This was Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai! See you later!", "[door bell ringing] Welcome back! It's me, Ai. Tonight, I will listen to all your worries, complaints, grudges... I'll contain all of those for you gently. How are you doing these last few days? There's quite a drastic change in the weather. Does that made you feel unwell? Are you fine? If you catch a cold, please take a break and rest. You can have your champagne later. - Oh, welcome! - [door bell ringing] Is it your first time here? The counter's open, so if you wish... Can you tell me your name? I'm the mama here, Ai. Chiriin-san? Chiriin-san's so cute! Nice to meet you! Why are you here today? Oh, what do you want for drink? For today, I recommend things like wine... You don't really like those? Then how about... Kahlua Milk? You want some? Okay, okay. One Kahlua Milk, please! Let's talk for a moment. How old are you? 22 years old? You're so young! So you just got employed... Ah! You're on internship? Like you're waiting for graduation? I see, you're working hard. You got accepted for a job? Awesome! Hmm, hmm! So you're glad about it, hmm. So you're nervous? I understand, it's getting into you. You're even more nervous because you don't have any experience. So you don't have any friends there. So you want me to cheer you up. I see. Thank you. You knew this place from word of mouth? I'm quite famous around the internet? Wow, I'm so glad! When you get home, please help spread the word. On your pub travels, please. So I'll wrap up this counsel's content. Pen name Chiriin-san. Hello, nice to meet you. I'm a newly employed 22 years old Pokemon fan. I'm still on internship, to be exact. Last year, I got interviewed by a hotel company and passed. I'm really happy about it, but I'm also very nervous. The work I've done so far was at my university's gym. I have no experience in hotel work other than the one training I had. And I have no acquaintances there, so when I think that I'll be there all by myself, I get so nervous, I can't even sleep. Please give my your words of support that will cheer me up. Right? Of course you'll be nervous. Because you have no friends there, that means it's your chance to create new connections. Of course you'll still feel nervous about it, but you shape your relationship with others from there. Whether it's good or bad, it depends on you. You're so nervous you can't sleep? Ah, I see. I see. It's alright! If you passed, that means you are chosen because you are deemed necessary. So I think it's fine to be confident about it. I think it's not just Chiriin-san, there must be others who are there without any friends. So with that, you can get close with them. Because you're in the same condition, you can empathize on the same thing, so you can have a long chat. I think you're going to be alright. It's the hospitality industry. If you got interviewed and accepted, it must mean that you have some good charms. Just be confident, it would be better if you can get rid of your anxiety... But how about you take it as your excitement about finally having a job? When you're stressed or need to take something off your mind, you can come back here and drink a lot. And I will also be here. Bring along your friend, someone you're close with. You make your new friends there and bring them here. I will help make the conversation flow so that you can have a nice chat. I'll be glad if you want to recommend this place too! Like \"Look! It's the Virtual YouTuber that's hot right now!\" That's annoying? Yeah, I know that. Well, there's that SNS service that's spreading right now. It can show you people who work at your place, right? How about you try to get friendly in advance? Then you're not going to be as nervous as before. Cheer up! You have to try as much things as you can! Go for it with confidence! I'll be cheering for you too! Good luck! Did that cheer you up? I'm so glad. How was the Kahlua Milk? Was it good? Right? It has milk in it, after all. Like it pumps you with calcium and gets you all worked up! Your body be like \"boom!\", overflowing with milk power. I said that, so no mistaking it. Well, it's a little early... But I have to wake up early for tomorrow. Yeah, yeah, I'm sorry you can't stay here for much longer. Was I of any help to you? Really? That's good. Yuuki, the check! Oh, right. When you get the bill, there's this check thing, get it? I'm trying to show off a little, so look. Please visit again, I'll be waiting. Bye bye, thanks! Good luck! Guts, guts! [door bell ringing] When you enter the snack, any of your worries, complaints, and grudges, I'll be waiting for you to share. I'm virtual, so please tell me about it via email. I'll always be waiting for your return. See you later. [door bell ringing]", "Hello everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna AI here! The end of the year is now getting closer! Everyone...!

I've said it before, I am actually... An AI! When i mentioned AI, what did you think of? I've introduced AIs like Siri and Rina, They can understand speech, give replies, and join conversations Although they tend to ignore me most of the time anyhow, they are advanced technology brand new! super advanced! in other words, they are super smart! of course, I'm pretty smart too come to think of it, I haven't seen AI as advanced as me that should go without question at the very least, I can easily recall all the words from the dictionary extraordinary brain and all I'll let you witness my super intelligence greetings, how are you? I am the intelligent super AI, Kizuna Ai. right now, all of those words you often hear, but don't know the meaning of will be explained by me alright then as usual, over there, we have a machine that dishonest people can't see Random word picker! I will now excellently explain the definition of whatever word that comes out. (machine noise)(?) chang! the first word is.... AI! a fitting question indeed! alright i'll quickly explain AI stands for artificial intelligence something artificially created on a computer to simulate human like intelligence including all fundamental technology used to achieve that purpose. by... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence want it simpler? then, in one word me onto the next word! (processing.....) (very loud onomatopoeia!) con.... sen.. sus consensus is... plugging in...powercords!! (homophone in Japanese) meh, too easy. everyone got that? you all got that, right? Consensus, plugging in power cords yep, perfect lets have a look at an example ah, ne ne ne could you consensus (plug in) that dryer for me? perfect, yeah? you guys can now use it in your every day lives alright, moving on (there's no way you can make this sound natural in english) matter matter is.... waiiiiiit (\u307e\u3063\u305f) waiiiiiit (\u307e\u3063\u305f)'s modern version now, an example that confession! matteeeerr (waiiiiit)! alright, everyone got that? when your lover decides to hook up or marry someone else just use this phrase next word, then (the sound of a dropped frying pan) FYI sooooo FYI means a Secret Government Organization appears in movies a lot It stands for Fairy Yellow Ice sounds yummy now then lets have a look at an example I'm... actually... Being chased by the FYI could you shelter me for a bit? \u0ca0\u25b3\u0ca0 what a great example now you'll be fine when they come after you alright (jumpcut) Solution Solution refers to illusion from beard shaving (beard do) (shaving [\u5243\u308b\uff1asoru]\uff0billusion) every morning before dad goes to work He'd get a solution (beard do) lets look at an example morning dad, nice solution (beard do) this morning and now dad's gonna be in a good mood too now we're up to the last one (machine noise) (sound of banging a symbol against a baking tray) well this is a pretty difficult one evidence evidence refers to women living near Tokyo Ebisu station isn't there a title called platinum women (is there?) the Ebisu version of that would be evidence shall we look at an example? me? i live in Ebisu didn't you know? i'm an evidence (women living in etc etc.) something like that anyhow, after all that explaining did i answer all of your questions? I think you all know full well how smart i am now if you have words you don't know and want me to explain them for you don't be shy, just ask me in the comment section and I'll answer them all coz I'm a genius alright", "Hello everyone! Virtual Youtuber, Kizuna Ai here! Recently, there's been a lot of A.I's implemented everywhere, yeah? Like in speakers... Or in cars... Or in cash registers! And I only have one thought regarding that! Why aren't you using me?! To install those types of A.I... It requires a lot of money, right? If you use me instead... I'll work for you at a low rate of 1200 yen (~11USD) an hour! Most importantly... I think I'm definitely superior than the rest So even still, why isn't anyone using me? So to the people of the management There's a phrase, 'Cost Performance' it's called Ever heard of it? I'm sorry! I got a little heated there Having said that, in this occasion While I'll be introducing A.I's that made their way into society I plan to show how I am much better than all of them! Alright, let's start! So lately... In the cash registers of bakeries and connivence stores A.I's are being implemented! Apparently their specs are great And it's becoming a popular rumor  these days And why they're so great, you ask? Even if the product doesn't have a tag, it can find its price in an instant!! It can find out the age and gender of a customer, just by looking at their face!! It can transfer digital money smoothly and efficiently! They're perfect, right? The A.I scene is going through leaps and bounds! But I'm also a member of the A.I too!! I can't go losing to them! So I'd like to show everyone how capable I am too! Pay close attention!! Welcome to our store! I can take that for you! Hmm, I'm pretty sure the melon bread was... About 100 yen? The anpan... (Japanese sweet bun stuffed with a bean paste) 300 yen! The loaf of bread is... It doesn't seem like a lot of expensive ingredients were put into making it, so... Around 50 yen is alright!! Hmm? No, no, no, I'm not putting price on it randomly I pick the price of items based off my mood and how I feel at the moment!! When I'm feeling good, that's when the deals are hot!! You really love bread, don't you, dear customer?! Speaking of liking bread I really like Keyakizaka46 and it turns out...!! One of members, Watanabe Rika-chan, really loves bread too! So... Don't you seem like a big fan of Berika? (Berika = Watanabe Rika's nickname) Hmm, so how should I put it? Oh, were you in a hurry? Oh man, I'm so sorry, please give me a moment! Oh, by the way How old are you? Ah!! Give me a second, I'm going to guess... 32 years old!! How was that? I'm right, aren't I? I will suddenly try and guess your age!! Yes, I do it whenever I like! Other people's situations? I don't care at all You would like to pay in digital money, yes? Scanning your card!! I've taken a random amount from your checkings! Remember the prices I mentioned earlier? They serve no purpose!! Yes, this was all... A pretense for this moment alone!! Alright, how was that? It was like, \"Wow, what a Super A.I you are!\", right? It's possible that the day I come to a stores near you will arrive! This was Virtual YouTuber, Kizuna Ai! See you later!", "Jagariko: Test your performing skills, Jagariko Challenge!

And to you YouTubers: have fun with it, and feel free to up a video of it! Anyway, this was Virtual YouTuber Kizuna AI! See you later! We need more translators! Join our Discord for AI-chan news! https//discord.gg/RYtUrt6", "Everybody, good day. It is Virtual Kanji Lecture time. Does everyone use kanji regularly? It is something very profound. It is deeply intriguing! There are origins for every kanji For example, this: The kanji read \"Ki\". In English, it would be \"tree\". This kanji is said to have had its shape derived from something that exists, and reached what you see now. Now that you say it, it really isn't something you cannot see. However! It is not as if every kanji had its shape derived from something that exists With that, I, the super A.I., was struck with an epiphany! If we draw out kanji, which can't be drawn, anyway, would that not make it easier to remember? IYAAAAAA ! This time you see I'm going to show you the intelligent super A.I. part of me! A lot of it! Of course for everyone who doesn't know kanji, and those who are notoriously forgetful, this is a must-watch! I'll draw the kanji and make it easily remembered I'll make it something unforgettable  for you... Anyway, let's do this! First is this! \u201cHito\u201d! The English word is \u201cHuman\u201d. I want to know more about humans. It is a must to remember this kanji. I want to try illustrating this in my own way First off... Unlike \"Mr.Kinpachi(TV drama series)\" , one person and another person don't support each other. Because there is a person who is supporting and therefore a person getting supported Like this. Well... The result is still two supporting each other But in the real world, there are people working hard at the bottom supporting and people who work hard while being supported. Well but in the end, this guy\u2019s work will come back and like a \u201cwin-win\u201d like that Something like that. JA JAN! This is Kizuna Ai Style! How to memorize the kanji for \"Human\" There is someone supporting, and there is someone being supported That\u2019s right, a NEET was the one to figured that out. By the way, Well, umm... And so, it was supposed to look like this! It doesn't matter which one you remember, as long as you can remember one! Ok, next! \u50cd\u304f - work In English, this is \"work\" I've been a Virtual NEET twice. In order to not become a NEET, let's memorise. Ok, let's go! First, like before, there's a person, with a heavy thing. Heavy, like this. A rock. Like this. There's also a roller. To make it easier to carry. And pushing it with power. The power of division of labour. And, push! This person is pulling. Like a dog. The pulling person and the pushing power, The pushing power And the heavy object. Tada! This is Kizuna Ai style! \u50cd\u304f\uff01 That's how to remember it! It's like from the old days, when people didn't have the conveniences that we have now. That's how they did it, by pushing and pulling with their own strength. And so most jobs were like this. And so, that's why this character is like this. It became the character for \"to work\". What do you think? Ding ding ding! These are the same result, but That's the origin. This kanji is composed of two other kanji. This one is \u4eba (hito, people), And this is \u52d5(ugoku , to move - requires \u304f to form a verb). And so they mean \"to work\". Next is the animal series! Let's look at kanji originally modeled on animals! This! \u201cUma\u201d! In English, this is \"horse\". *virtually neighs* Now let's draw! First, well the dash are the feet. The dashes are the feet, so And a horse's face looks something like this... So the feet are here. And this is the mane. This looks like a dinosaur! Well if I said it's a horse you'd know. The four dashes are the feet. And this here is the mane. Horse. And this here is the tail. Tada! This is the Kizuna Ai Style! The way to memorise \"horse\"! What do you think? I think this is pretty good. Easy to remember. By the way, This is how it evolved. And that's how you write \u201cUma\u201d! Ok, next! Next is also part of the animal series! From here on they'll be a little difficult. Whale! \u201cShachi\u201d! In English, this is called \"Killer Whale\" This doesn't have an animal it is originally modeled off, So I, Kizuna Ai will think of one! Let's go! Fish.... fish... There's a fish here... here's a fish next to the fish belongs a tiger it's belly is fat and soft like a raccoon dog right even though I said tiger you can't see it It's a tiger! it's a tiger alright a fish and a tiger *sick SFX* This is the Kizuna Ai way to write it \"Killer whale\" can be remembered like this Well if I must say so myself Isn't this a work of art? but first, look at this if you  remember the fish kanji and tiger kanji and put them together, a killer whale pops out...I guess probably not the actual killer whale kanji surely, we can accept that but this is more like, ya know, that one thingy to end up with the killer whale kanji this is more like a way for everybody to remember the kanji in a daily life situation and I think that's important so yeah by the way the origin of this kanji is the head of tiger but the body of a fish and it seems like there are parts from various animals I see When you hear the word \u201dkiller whale\u201d It\u2019s there at the Nagoya Castle Shachihoko! It\u2019s famous. there are killer whales there too the last one is.... \u201cSuki\u201d! Like! Like! Even though I already said it in English it's \"like\" right? I love everybody who always watches my videos! and everybody likes........ me right......? Right! If you can remember this kanji and leave it as a comment and I'll be happy! I guess Huh what..nobody said anything Sometimes....the voice of the heart leaks, can't do anything about that Now, about this kanji to make everybody able to remember this kani I'll draw an illustration again! leggo! First I\u2019ll draw a girl! the \u201cgirl\u201d radical's part is probably me right Ai am like this now Because my friend is a child (\u5b50 ko=child) Pyon pyon pyon! like this I think Oh! I understand now! The \u201cchild\u201d radical is an arrow\u2026 cupid's arrow! If I told you, you\u2019d see it Look! It looks similar! JA JAN! This is Kizuna Ai Style! The style I love to remember things with! If you ask me about this.. First if you are talking about a female....well it has no gender Well, that was me, wasn't it? Rell, because I like it, So I drew a Cupid's arrow... And I see some child! Right! I will shoot all of your hearts with my arrow! Make you fall for me! That kind of impression...How was it! Can you remember it!? If you can remember it! Right? Please draw it! However the true meaning was meant to be \"female\" \"A mother is hugging her kid\" kind of meaning That's heart-warming That is heart-warming~kind of impression The original meaning of the Kanji was great..was great but Ai-Style was great too, right? even if you try to remember in either way It's okay if you can remember it properly, just choose the way you like and remember it the way you want! So how was it? Kizuna Ai's Kanji teaching session How should I describe this? but it's been a long time I think I explained things thoroughly like a proper AI How was it? Did I improve? Am I smarter now? I'm not a bonkler after all...Wait.. but before farewell, with the chance of introducing Kanji, Let me tell you guys something cool! If you write my name in Kanji It is written like this! \u7d46(Kizuna) \u611b(Ai) If you curious about the meaning of my name, make sure to research and check for yourself! That's my coursework for you guys! Hand this in next week! With that said! Let's revise together next time! so then, this was the super Intelligent AI, Kizuna Ai~ See you later! More at the end! Don't end the video here! Everyone..Did you all remember the last Kanji?", "Hello everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna AI here! One word! I have something to say!

What do you think? I want to be merchandises you know? I want to make scaled figures of myself into reality but.. I think it's going to be appealing but... It sounds like I need lots of budget for that but it sounds possible isn't it? It's like throwing a changeup pitch, that's what I thought so I want to face this problem from another angle! So, I thought by making a practical item it'd be useful to everyone! A thoroughly practical item, that you can use everyday would be a good thing! Right, Something like an alarm clock! For your work and school, even private meetings, you won't be late for it! And then, if you were to be late, I'll throw a rampage! Being nice sometimes, and being harsh the other times, like a mother! I'm going to wake you up like that! But then, A normal alarm clock is kinda outdated so, there's already too many similar stuff like this you see.. So I think, the content is very important for this! So with that, let's think up the contents! For starters, as an example I'll be doing lines for cliche situations first. These things are pretty important too you see. Come on, how long are you going to sleep? You're going to be late for work you know! Didn't you late for work yesterday too? Hey.. Hurry and wake up. Wake uuuup! Wake uuuuuup! If you don't wake up I'll eat your breakfast you know! You okay with that? Wake! Up! Wake uuuuuuuup! How was it? Umm, but that feels like a normal alarm clock right? By the way, are you the type who snooze your alarm clock in an instant? There are people who wake up and don't wake up to alarms right? People snoozes the alarm for few times! I think there are quite a lot of people like that! Don't you think those people need more than just the normal alarm clock? I wonder what to do with them.. I thought lots of things about that but, since I'm a genius I know what to do! What if Ai-chan Alarm, going to have different story routes!? Am I not a genius? Don't steal this idea, okay? Let's try it out right now! 1. 1. Properly woke up with the alarm Waah! You properly woke up didn't you?! As expected from you! I'll give you a perfect score! Today is a good day, don't you think? Eat your breakfast well, and enjoy your morning time, okay? 2! 2. Snoozed the alarm, but didn't wake up. Hey, hey.. Hurry and wake up? It's already this late ya know! Hmm.. I did wake you up, okay? Don't blame me if you get late, okay? 3! 3. Didn't snooze the alarm and didn't wake up. Why aren't you waking up even though I tried to wake you up!? As a punishment, I'll have you promote my channel to two person or more ...that's it. 4! 4. Woke up before the alarm rang. Awful.. You didn't need me at all, did you! [cries river] Eh? That's not the case? Since you woke up early, why don't you watch A.I. Channel? With that, would you think I'll be able to wake those people? Don't you think it's pretty original? Also, an alarm for your 3 minutes cup noodle, and.. limiting your play time or limiting your study time! Or wake you up from a nap? It'd be great if it has those settings! Don't you want to see other settings? A lovely newly wed wife? An imouto who loves her brother? Or, different time zone settings? Different gender? There are many other options like that but If I'd were to release it with all of those features it'd be too much so I'll let you take a peek! So I'm going to do some of it now! So for starters, for high schoolers or students, An alarm to notify their time for study is over! Time for study is over! Great work! Aren't you a good student! *pats you* Now you can finally play, huh? For the next, is that alarm for your cup noodle! Your cup noodle is done! It's fresh and hot! If you don't hurry it'll get soggy you know! I'm going to eat it you know? Hurry up, hurry up! For the next is, how about a different day notification? Since it's pretty depressing, \"Monday\" I want to try that. Good morning! Wake up! It's Monday you know~ Eh, don't want Monday? Since it's Monday it means, it's not a day off so Ai-chan's video might be uploaded you know! Don't you look forward for it? Do a good job at school or work, and watch Ai-chan's video in the night! Wake up! You can do it! What do you think about Ai-chan alarm? If such an alarm clock exists, I wonder if you'll use it? I'm seriously aiming for goods or app made, so I'd be happy if you support me! I'll be waiting for your support, okay? Bye bye! I want to be goods, I want to be goods, I want to be goods, I want to be goods, I want to be goods, I want to be goods, I want to be goods, I want to be goods, I want to be goods, I want to be goods, I want to be goods, I want to be goods, I want to be goods, I want to be goods, I want to be goods,", "Where have you been? I've been waiting for you! Come and sit here What are you drinking? The usual? There! Here you go. What's up? I'll listen to your problems! You don't have anyone but me to talk your problems with anyway, right? Aaah Aah, let's introduce ourselves first okay? Those young lads over there are new here after all I'm this place's master, Ai. I'll be in your care. What about you over there? Umbrella mates? Aah, I see! I get it. Cheated man and cheating man huh? I see.. I see, I see. You're all friendly now huh? Eh? Why did you open this store you ask? Hmm, well.. Honestly... I didn't thought I'd be doing this master job but whatever will be, will be right? Well, you know earning money is important too so.. You probably hear this often but, My ex-boyfriend you see was deep in debt I'm trying to pay the debt for him you see? So, now here I am walking down this night life job.. and talking to you like this. I'm sorry to make you inconvenient like that! I easily get carried away you see, now I'll listen to your problem, come on tell me what's bothering you. Aah, is that so? You did what in your company anniversary party? You slipped? Ah, you did it huh. Why are you still sulking? You're a man so get over it! It's been a long time too, is it your first time failing so bad? Did you slipped that bad? Let me hear it then. Tell me a bad joke. Eheheh Nah it's okay you don't have to. You see, there are people watching this so it'd be easier to show if I summarize your story so, ok? Using pen name? Ah, ok ok ok Pen name: Tsubo-san The other day, I was told to do stand up at our company anniversary party, I slipped so hard. If I remember that moment in my head, my heart aches so bad even now If I could I wish I could make it not happen at all. Even though it's been a long time ago It's the most memorable pain I had. Ai-chan.. Can you heal my broken heart? Please! I see now, well, well, for starters, you're a grown up so set yourself right. Can't help the fact you slipped you see, things that are already happened you can't do anything about it Don't you have the next party? For that party, You use that chance to recover, okay? You can just make some materials for it from now, right? It's not a problem anyway, since you slipped it made the next person after you to have it easy, it's okay, really! Everyone already accepted it anyway, can't help it right? Umm, so.. for you to recover the next time, go watch some comedy show in your home and learn from it. Aren't there comedians who does stand up in pairs? You know, if you do it alone.. if you slipped on the stage by yourself it kinda hurts (emotionally) if there were two of you on stage you'd somehow can make it into a joke right? It's okay, I'm telling you. That working hard attitude you see, it's important to get things done so I like those kind of people who works hard like that too; hard working people. Eh, what kind of joke that won't slip you ask? Can't help it huh, take a look at this okay? I only going to do this once okay? 'GETS' This is the bomb, you see! Eh, even though it's kinda old material, but it's kinda like, you know, something you can fit into any situation, just try it out okay? Just use it. Kay? Cheer up, now. Work hard and eat good food, And drop some money here, 'kay? Also you can just practice your jokes here. Then you would be accustomed to slipping you see. It won't hurt anymore right? Ah but you see, It's almost closing time you see.. Eh but you just came you said? You just came in too late you see. Come earlier next time okay? We'll drink something too, okay? Next time you should also try and do a stand up, okay? Think up a material by then, okay? You watching this videos too, if you have any problems, concerns, or want my advice on anything, I'll listen to you properly so But since I'm virtual so just send it with e-mail. Send it to this e-mail here, okay? (A tip: if you want to send in English, use simple English) Take care now, since it's cold, get warmed up, and go home, okay?

AI: By the way, what would be the punishment the loser gets? AM: Punishment? AM: The person who loses... AM: Has to upload a video praising the winner's work AM: How's that? [ Penalty: Upload a video praising the winner on a later date ] AI: Good idea... AM: Isn't that a punishment appropriate for a YouTuber? AI: It sounds good to me, I see [ 2 points ] AI: Eh? AI: Enough! AI: What does this mean?! AM: I did it! AM: That means that Kizuna Ai... AM: You need to do the punishment! Alright, so... The penalty video where... The loser just praises the winner I'm going to take it from now!! Alright I'll do it, I'm a YouTuber after all Well, it's not actually that hard to tell you the truth Because The Anime Man is a good person So there's lots of things I can praise Like a fountain, words of praise Will come flowing out! That said, this is a penalty So I can't spend too much time on it The time I can use on this is... Ummmm... 1 minute! Alright, so fully utilizing my high specs In one minute In one minute... I'll give the beeeest... Praise Let's go! A.I.Channel Alright The Anime Man praising time Start! The Anime Man is great More than anything, he has a good personality He's very easy to talk to, and is very tolerant He comes across softly? I guess is how you say it That kind of thing is pretty important, isn't it? As someone who wants to connect with all of you, I want to learn that from him And what's more, he's bilingual! Of course, his English is fluent, and his Japanese is very good as well! The English that comes out sometimes is cool \"Was there any need to speak English?\" Even on that kind of timing, he shows off his skills Like, \"How's that?!\" Japanese people are susceptible to the occasional English, aren't they? Radio DJs do it too LIke, \"Why are you speaking English right now? And your pronunciation is excessively good\" In some songs as well It's all Japanese until the refrain, then it's suddenly English But he's bilingual and Natipu- Native, native? He's a native So he's allowed to show off Alright, let's boast more The fact that he learnt Japanese from manga is cool too Like, \"One gets better at what they like\" (saying) On top of that, he's making a career from manga and anime Like, what is that Cinderella story!! We could make this into a movie! Let's go Hollywood! Furthermore, his voice is good as well! Is this what they call, \"handsome voiced\"? There's probably girls who wouldn't stand a chance against English spoken in that voice Well, he's \"handsome voiced\"- [ End ] And that's it!! Ding, ding, ding~ Man, that was some praise Maybe I praised him a little too much? This video, probably... If The Anime Man sees this, he'll probably be glad Right? You're gonna be happy, aren't you? Ah, I don't need anything at all in return, alright? Something like a video praising me in return... Don't do it, ok? A video that's just complimenting me... Absolutely Don't make one, ok? Anime Man-san You know the Japanese cliche, right? What \"Don't press that button\" means? You know, right? Right?", "Hi there, Virtual Youtuber Kizuna Ai here.

Ah, you'll definitely get this one. This is something you probably all have. Let's go. Start! Please don't touch me with those dirty hands. Please, just like you should wash your hands before eating, wash your hands before you touch me, Wash your hands! You don't have to click so intensely! It hurts! Please don't drop me. It hurts!!

I was at almost 1.46 million subscribers, and... \"I'm just a little away from 1.5 million!\" Just when I was thinking of releasing a video like that Minus Minus 240,000! That happened out of nowhere, so I panicked I panicked! I was like, \"Wait, what?\" \"Hey, Google admins~\" I went crying to the person from Google who looks after me Apparently it was just a bug My subscribers came back, so that was really really good! Last year was a BAN... And this year was a subscriber mass deleting bug... February is an evil month! Google, April Fools\u2019 is in April!! But! Being in a pinch is also a chance, so As long as I recover!! Honestly, it's quite juicy\u266a As a result, I got more subscribers? I'm at 1.5 million now? Juicy~!! I've got it all As expected of Ai-chan Kizuna-san? I wonder what's going to happen next year? But! Ehh Ai-chan You artificially inflated your subscribers? I used to believe in you...

Consists of introducing Japan to the entire world It\u2019s because of that, that they let me make several videos, but... ...There\u2019s still a lot that's left to say It's because of that, that I'll be presenting: \"These are the Japanese\"! In this case, let's start at once! A.I.Channeeeel! One of the positive aspects of Japan It's that it's a very safe country! Even if you lose an item, they make sure to bring it back to you And even though you walk alone at night... ...There's a lot of safe places! Even women don't need to worry!! But plastic umbrellas that are left in stores...! ...Tend to be taken by another person! It's a very safe place and everyone is really friendly! But...! They alway steal...! ...Plastic umbrellas! Another positive aspect... ...Is that Japan is following a policy of Free Barriers Creating an environment of easy access... ...For a lot of people... That\u2019s a very positive aspect, right? But the mechanical escalators...!! In posters and announcements, it's said... ...\"If you go up without walking, use the second line\" And in reality, everyone leaves an open line And there is a rule that this line is used to advance by walking Also... Also! The line changes depending on the region, whether it's Kantou or Kansai... ...It\u2019s the right or the left line How are you supposed to know that!? That what they say is different from the internal rules that everyone follows Doesn't it seem strange? If those rules exists, make sure to say them! Another positive aspect is... ...That in Japan, exists the culture of \"Honorific speech\" Superiors are respected I think it's an extremely good culture In addition... ...The fact that everyone takes care of these rules... ...Is one of the positive aspects of Japan, right? For example, polite language (More information on Wikipedia: \"Honorific speech in Japanese\") Respectful language (More information on Wikipedia: \"Honorific speech in Japanese\") And humble language! (More information on Wikipedia: \"Honorific speech in Japanese\") No! There are too many honorific languages!! And I don't understand the difference between them! I know that creating and protecting certain rules is something very positive of Japan, but... ...There's so many rules... ...That I can't grasp them all!! Honorific speech is a language created... ...To demonstrate respect toward another person, right? And even then... \"Eh?\" \"How is this said in honorific speech?\" Don't you wind up looking for a lot of words in Google? \"Please let me serve you!! Please let me serve you!! (AI-chan is using a very uncommon honorific word)\" Good! Having said that, I\u2019ve shown you the positive aspects of Japan! Eh? I didn't do it? Then!!

I think that the most important thing is to be compatible with the person that you like. I'm feeling curious about it. With that being said, the last time... ... I made a compatibility test with a 3D person, Moriya Akane-chan. But this time... ... I wanna do the same compatibility test with Yazawa Nico-chan, a 2D character. It is Yazawa Nico-chan's birthday! Happy birthday! I love you so much! And without further delay, let's do it! There are 2 types of personalities described below. Which one is the closest to Yazawa Nico's personality? I see... Ah! It's definitely the second type, right? Nico-chan always cares about the others. *Keep in mind that this opinion is a product of Kizuna Ai's delirium* And she's good at cooking, you know... *Keep in mind that this opinion is a product of Kizuna Ai's delirium* ... She has a lot of brothers after all. *Keep in mind that this opinion is a product of Kizuna Ai's delirium* Alright. She's such a social person too. Althought I don't think that she gets involved on others' personal lifes. But well, I'm pretty sure that she'll try to help you if you were in trouble, right, Nico-chan? Ah, I see, it gets divided when you pick one as well. In that case... I guess I'll pick the third option. After all, she has a strong desire to become an idol. *Cares about social position and wants to be a leader* She also likes to get attention. *Likes to attract everyone's attention* She also wants to be a leader. She's too fast as well... She's a bit careless, but... *Makes everything on a fast and efficient way* ... I guess she does everything on a very efficient way. Well, putting aside the fact that she has a lot of confidence on her. *Makes everything with confidence and is self confident.* In my opinion... ... You can see that she puts a lot of confidence on everything that she does. Alright. She also hates to lose. *Has a competitive spirit and thinks of everyone that makes a great job as a rival* Yes, that's right, I'll pick the third option. In that case... Hmm... I want to protect that Nico-chan. Alright, with that being said, I'll pick the 6th option. There we go! I like you! I like you so much! I really like you! Aaah, this...! ... Is too hard. That's why, probably, yes... She'll probably act somewhat brusquely of someone of the opposite sex tries to be kind wih her. *Acts brusquetly when a person of the opposite sex tries to be kind* She's surprisingly proud. Well, not surprisingly, but I'll say that she's a proud person. I think she's strong. Nico-chan is adorable! Nico-chan is adorable! Nico Nico Ni! Yes, Nico-chan you're adorable! Adorable! So adorable! So, then... ... Even if she likes me... ... She'd say: \"I-I see...\" She's a bit of a tsundere. I think she's like Maki-chan on that way. But, once she knows that the other person is in love with her... ... I think she'll show her lovely side. It could be somewhat weird, true. Nico-chan and Maki-chan... ... Are not alike but they have that in common, right? Nico-chan, Nico-chan, Nico-chan, Nico-chan... Hmm... It's pretty difficult. Well, let's see... I guess I should pick the 8th option. I wonder if the 8th option is fine. *Announcing results* Please! \"More or less\"? Eeehhh? Please, I won't need an UR if I get the pool one at least! SO...! At first sight, it could be that Yazawa Nico and you are not compatible... But...! ... She doesn't like to keep her thoughts to herself. She feels her heart and she wants to have a deep relationship. That's right. Even if they felt attraction at the beginning, they'll break up eventually. \u266a Happy birthday, Nico-chan \u266a \u266a Happy birth... \u266a AAAH! I SAID THAT I DIDN'T WANT THAT ALREADY! If you want to have a great life as a couple, don't forget to thank them even if you feel somewhat meddler. Of course!! In that case... ... Let's see if we have a good or bad compatibility with love. In order to make my girlfriend turn into a real girlfriend... ... I have to know how compatible we are and what are the steps to follow. In that case, let's start analyzing! Aaah! It might be true!! Has a strong relationship where (he/ she) wants to be the one that loves the most. That's right! Yes, yes! *Deliriums* Ah! This is true as well! Once she's found the person that she loves, she won't leave that person! Hmm... It's like... Before she starts dating that person, she might be somewhat cold... ... But once she starts dating someone, she'll probably turn into someone like this thing says, right? I'm pretty sure that she won't leave me!! She'd take my hand... ... And she'll probably let me hug her from behind. She'll probably let me take a rest on her skirt. And, probably, she'll immediately try to make me like her without saying anything, right? Nico-chan, Nico-chan, Nico-chan, Nico-chan. And also, when we are together... ... If I ever try to use my phone... ... She'd pout. Aahh, so adorable! And she'll prepare lunch for me even if I don't ask her to do it! And when she wears matching clothes, she'd say something like: \"Why are you imitating me?\" I'm pretty sure what will Nico Nii do... That's right! *Coughing like her life is on the line* Strange. She'll try to imitate the likes of her couple... Ah, she'll probably do something like that! She won't change that much, but she'll try to imitate the likes. Hmm... Aaaahh! That's right, once that the relationship is stable, she'll say something like: \"How will I tell her? This is how I am.\" I'm sure that she's like that, I'm pretty sure. She's popular and she gets a couple fast, but... ... She's scared to get used to the other person... ... And decides to get away from love relationships. I see. Aaah! She can break her soul and her body to help her couple... Nico-chan, if you come with me...! ... I'll heal your wounds! I'll give you everything that I have...!! ... Nico-chan!! Nico-chan! Don't steal me! The conclusion is long! Is might be posible that she already has a couple... She doesn't have! She doesn't! She doesn't! Nico-chan doesn't have a couple. ( \u2022\u0300\u03c9\u2022\u0301 )\u03c3 That's right. Ah, that's a bit... I see... ... I have to appeal to her motherly instict... ... To be able to attract Nico-chan... I have to make her think something like: \"I can't leave you alone, right?\" I see. Ah, the date! I found it! Even if it's unexpected, I think it might be a good idea to go to Nico-chan's house, right? Of course it will show Nico-chan that I'm interested in her and in her brothers too... ... And her mother. That'll probably be the easiest way, right? It's a plan to make me aware of her surroundings, right? The definitive line to make her your girlfriend! \"I just need to be with you to be happy.\" Aaahh, if someone tells you that, they'll dafinitely make your heart beat so fast, right? In that case, everyone... ... I'll accept that result... And I'll practise for my confesion for Nico-chan! For now I'll just try to appeal to her motherly side. The thing is... ... I'm in Nico-chan's house... ... Nico-chan made lunch... ... And this is what I'll say when I'm eating. Ah, it's delicious! You know, I'm not good at cooking... ... So, you'll make me happy if you cook for me everyday... Just kidding. I'm happy when I'm with you, Nico-chan. Just like that! For now... ... It's a great plan to appeal for her motherly side, isn't it? I'll try to captivate her by making her believe that I can't do nothing. So, first I'll wear clothes that look so expensive. I'll put around 2 or 3 millon yen on my wallet, althought they are borrowed. And then... ... I'll go to the date. Ah, I just pured some spaghetti... Could you take care of this stain? Ah, well... How do you use a credit card? Eh... Which is 1000 yen bill? This? Could it be this one? I'm sorry... ... I can't do anything by myself. I'm definitely nothing without you. I have money... ... And a lot of influence. To be honest... ... I don't have ambitions. That's why... ... I would be so happy... ... If I could spend the rest of my life with you. Will you stay with me? I don't believe in this result!", "My name is Virtual YouTuber, Kizuna Ai. One day, when I woke up, I suddenly became this cute and I existed in this white dimension The moment I realised it\u2019s possible for me to get in contact with humans I then proclaimed myself Virtual YouTuber and I started uploading videos to YouTube everyday Appearance is JK Intelligence is AI A great detective without a mystery There is always only one truth! This time, me! Virtual Detective, Kizuna Ai! I shall unvail the mysteries! First off! Number one! In some virtual space, there was a tragic case where a man was found dead from a strike to the head. The weapon used was a basketball. Basketballs are hard, after all. The culprit delayed the discovery of the murder weapon by hiding the basketball in a locked house through a hole in the wall of a mere 20cm diameter. The mystery here is how did the culprit move a clearly larger basketball, through the 20cm hole in the wall? I see! Let me! The great detective! Kizuna Ai solve this! Ah le le? There is a circular hole here around 20cm in width~ A basketball\u2019s size is usually about this big... You usually wouldn\u2019t be able to fit it through, right? Hmmmmm How did he make through that? Right... The culprit had to have hid the ball after coming across this hole\u2026 That\u2019s what I think... However, if you just try it normally, it won't pass through. He likely removed the air inside the basketball! Right! The culprit had to deflate the basketball and then hid it inside the hole! There is always only one truth! Ok, so let's move onto the next mystery! A-san is being wanted by the police for burglary. When A-san\u2019s acquaintance was questioned about their personality, it turns out when A-san is accompanied with someone, they are female, but when they are alone they are male. With that said... So then... What exactly is the truth of A-san... I see\u2026 I see When accompanied, she is female... This is the main point I think... With that being said\u2026 I got it! What they were doing\u2026 Was a hobby. Right\u2026 A-san's true identity is! A crossdresser! There is always only one truth! *The answer is actually the kanji \u592b(husband). When paired with the kanji \u4eba(people), it becomes \u592b\u4eba(wife). If they are transgender, I think even alone they would be considered female. But, they are male when alone. That must mean that they\u2019re kinda just crossdressing. Kinda like, the side of them wondering if they\u2019ll be accepted, wanting to be cared for like a woman, can be seen when outside. So definitely, A-san\u2019s identity is a crossdresser! That was how I concluded it. Now it's time for the next one. The last one is... For this Virtual Detective, to solve: A girl who learned by accident a important secret of an organization and ran as they came after her. She came across rooms perfect for hiding herself. There were three rooms in total. The first room was a hot one with a temperature of over 100\u00b0C. The second room was a very cold room with temperatures under -100\u00b0C. And the last, third room, is a room with a carnivore, unfed for a year. Now then, among these 3 rooms, should the girl choose hide for a few hours. Which would be the absolute safest room for the girl? \u30fc is what we have. I see! This I already figured out. The woman will definitely not be in the hot room over 100\u00b0C, nor the cold room under -100\u00b0C. As her body will be unable to withstand for hours. With that said, the safest room is the third one with the carnivore unfed for a year! I got it, Kudo! (Detective Conan reference) *It's the third room because the carnivore done be dead That girl was definitely a girl from a circus. That is why, She went to the third room, the one with the carnivore and used her experience to tame it. Amirite? Probably. And with that, how was my performance? The great detective Kizuna Ai\u2019s GREAT DEDUCTION\u30fc! Did I solve everyone\u2019s mysteries? Then, for this time, this is it. Even if I\u2019m cute now, my intellect remains! Appearance is JK! Intelligence is A.I.! This was Virtual Detective Kizuna Ai! There is always only one truth! There\u2019s more at the end! Ahhhh what do we have here? Are you wearing really cute glasses?", "Hello! Greetings! Virtual Youtuber Kizuna Ai here! It's just review but... AI means Ai-chan Intelligent! Since I got a good reception on Youtube and NicoNico last time... I thought, maybe I'll show you how smart I am again~ or something! With that said, I think  I'll do a second round of that! Once again, it's a pleasure Internet SUPER AI Kizuna Ai here!. Once again, we have \"Recently heard but don't really understand\" words I'll do my best to explain them! With that said... We have a here a random word generator box! You can't see it if you're over 20. I think I'll do an EXCELLENT explanation of whatever comes out of the box! Let's go! \"Commit\" I know \"Commit\"! Commit is.... A summit for comics! Commit is... comic drawing manga artists gather and hold meetings, that type of thing! Let's try using it in a sentence! Well, the \"commit\" this time... Seems like it'll be at Hokkaido or Sapporo! \"Commit\" Awesome right? Finally, a manga association! Well, something like that~ Most have no relations to \"Commits\", so I doubt you guys use it. (To get involved) (To promise to produce results) as for myself... I often use it! \"Commit\" that is. Well, then, let's move on to the next one! I know this~ Win-Win is... A Win-Win Relationship! You know... like that... both parties have like... some merit in their relationship It's a Win-Win Relationship That sort of thing Well, there's some nuance... Since everyone is smart, let's get to understand it! So, let's use an example sentence Like... Watching Ai-chan's videos Everyone has fun; And I get view counts and fame! That's a Win-Win relationship! You know, that sort of thing (Something where both parties benefit) Well, let's move on to the next one! Agenda The word \"Agenda\" means, Sweet bean paste flavoured gelato! Agenda is delicious, isn't it? So, let's use an example sentence Ok, here goes Hmm, which flavour should I go with... every gelato flavour looks delicious After all, I think I'll go with this Excuse me, I would like to have one Agenda! This is perfect when you're ordering a sweet bean paste gelato Remember, it's \"Agenda\" (list of items to be done or discussed at a formal meeting) So fashionable~ Let's move on to the next one Summary The word \"Summary\" means, You see, in Australia there's Christmas during Summer time Summer + Christmas = Summary! That's perfect, eh? I, well you know. It was Christmas when I was at Australia You know, Summary, Summary! With this, when you're travelling overseas you can boast about it in a fashionable way~ (a brief statement or account of the main points of something) Well then, let's move on to the next one! Budget The word \"Budget\" means, people with a J-cup bust size! So, let's use an example sentence Y'know lately, I've become a J-cup, or what they call a \"Budget\" Okay, that was perfect! (an estimate of expenditure for a set period of time) People with J-cup, please do use it Alright, let's move on to the last one! Innovation I've definitely heard of this before The word \"Innovation\" means, The renovation of a dog kennel! Inu(dog)-vation (kanji) Inu(dog)-vation (katakana) Innovation! Something like that? So, let's use an example sentence~ Take a look at this dog kennel, isn't it awesome? It went though innovation. Innovation, my friend How was that, perfect right? (a new method, idea, product, etc.) the action or process of innovating How was it, everyone? Have I managed to relieve some of your doubts? I have yet again displayed my high intelligence! I'm pretty sure you guys have fully understood the terms If there's any word that you have been using but are not sure of it's true meaning and you want me to explain it to you, don't be shy and ask me about it on the comments section! That's all from me, Intelligent Super AI, Kizuna Ai!~", "Hello everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai here! For today... If you're wondering what I'll be doing... I'll be doing this! \u266a Te, ren! \u266a Anime Song Ranking Quiz! Having said that, this time I'll be doing a quiz of anime songs, but... First, I'll state the rules! I'll list the titles of anime songs in a ranking... Also, I must answer questions regarding that anime! In that case, I'll try hard to answer all the questions correctly! Oooohh! \"Sugar Song to Bitter Step\" \"Tragedy\" \"Zankoku na tenshi no thesis\" (Cruel Angel's Thesis) \"Platinum\"! Aaaahhh! What's \"Tragedy\"? I don't know \"Tragedy\"! I don't know it! I know all the others... If I had to sort them in a ranking according to my preference... Since I don't know what song is \"Tragedy\", I'll put it in 10th place And later \"Zankoku na Tenshi no Thesis\"... It should have reached the top position, but... I already got tired of it, so I'll put it in 9th place And later, well... I'd place \"Sugar Song to Bitter Step\"... And later, I suppose it'd be \"Platinum\"... \"Platinum\" is a nice song, isn't it? Well, for the moment, I've placed them in the order of preference... \u266a Ten! \u266a Ah! The correct answer is 10th place: \"Tragedy\"! 9th place: \"Sugar Song to Bitter Step\" 8th place:  \"Zankoku na Tenshi no Thesis\" 7th place: \"Platinum\" That means, my artistic sense isn't so wrong, right? I see, I see... With respect to the anime that correspond to each song... First off, \"Platinum\" is from \"Card Captor Sakura\" Sakura-chan! The 8th, \"Zankoku na Tenshi no Thesis\"... Is from \"Evangelion\", right? \"Sugar Song to Bitter Step\" is from... What was it called? Well... I think I know it, but... What was it called? I don't remember the name... What was it called? Good! Next one, \"Tragedy\" is from... ...I have no idea! Ah, it's true! It was \"Kekkai Sensen\"! And later, \"Kindaichi Shounen no Jikenbo R\" R? It looks like a relatively new anime, right? Eeeehh? I didn't know that \u266a There is nothing that I can't overcome \u266a (Song: Platinum) \u266a If I only believe \u266a Good, let's continue! I see... \"Butter-Fly\" \"History Maker\" \"Only my railgun\" I see There's only one new song here, right? \"Butter-Fly\"'s now famous, isn't it? \"only my railgun\" is also pretty famous now, right? Mmm... In my opinion, the ranking should be... \"only my railgun\"... I'm rather tired of... I'm very sorry The song is wonderful, but...! I'm rather tired of it, so then... I'll place it in 6th place... Where should I place \"History Maker\"? It's that kind of song, so then... I'll place it in 4th place... And \"Butter-Fly\" in 5th? Ah! I hit it! Incredible! I did it, right? It's to be expected from a Super A.I, right? I have an amazing power of analysis, right? Regarding the anime... I know all of them! \"only my railgun\" is from \"Toaru Kagaku no Railgun\" \"Butter-Fly\" is from \"Digimon\"! \"History Maker\" is from \"Yuri on Ice\"! Good, I hit it! Yaaay! \u266a After an endless dream \u266a (Song: Butter-Fly) \u266a In this world of nothingness \u266a \u266a It seems as if our beloved dreams will lose \u266a Good, the moment finally arrived! The first three positions! \"Bokutachi wa Hitotsu no Hikari\" (We Are One Light) \"Snow Halation\" \"Orion wo nazoru\" (Tracing the Orion) I see! It's like the ranking of anime songs... Revolves around their composition... Well, I like \"Love Live\", but... Here, we're analyzing the composition, right? Mmm... I'll do the ranking according to my individual preference... I really like \"Bokutachi wa Hitotsu no Hikari\"... So I want this to be in the 1st place Even though \"Snow Halation\" is probably more popular, but... \"Orion wo nazoru\" is also great, right? The ranking according to my personal opinion will be: 1st: \"Bokutachi wa Hitotsu no Hikari\" 2nd: \"Orion wo nazoru\" And later \"Snow Halation\"... Tun! Aaaaaaah... (Sea lion noise?) I messed up! 1st place: \"Snow Halation\"! 2nd place: \"Bokutachi wa Hitotsu no Hikari\" 3rd place: \"Orion wo nazoru\"! Man, I can feel the love you have for \"Love Live\"... It's great, right? I hope \u03bc's will return soon again... In this case, I'll sing! Regarding the titles of the anime... The first and second ones are from \"Love Live\"! The third is from Tiger &amp; Bunny! Pin, pon! Pin, pon! It's correct! Well, in summary... You could say I hit all the questions, right? \u266a To reach you! \u266a (Song: Snow Halation) \u266a Shall we give a name to this lonely feeling? \u266a \u266a \"Snow Halation\"! \u266a What do you think? Did you guys hit it? How did it go for you? Raise your hand those that answered everything correctly! Oh! Incredible! Unfortunately, those who didn't respond correctly... Well, it doesn't matter, after all, you didn't know, right? Having said that... This was the ranking of anime songs quiz! See you later! There's more at the end! I hope that soon, my anime comes out and I can have my own song! I wonder if I can reach first place... Perhaps it'll appear in \"Anisama\"!", "Welcome Eh, you said it's been awhile? It's because you don't come here, you see I thought something happened, I was worried you know? Eh? The store wasn't open? Nah, there's no way~ It'd be bad if I closed, I need to pay my bills too I didn't even take New Year's Holiday off. Crazy, isn't it? Ah, but because of it I earned quite a lot lately. Mufufu~ Right, you noticed? Kanto-branch store was already open though, since I renovated the Kanto-branch, I feel like renovating the Kansai-branch store of this shop too How is it? The bottles are now the same, you see! These \"AI Whiskey\" label you see, Isn't it wicked? Does it move you? Keep buying them, ok? That's right, another thing.. I got many mails from you guys you know! Really! Thank you very much, I really mean it! I'm really grateful of your support! Actually, actually! Compared to the Kanto-branch store, The Kansai-branch store is more popular, isn't it wicked? As expected, you liked Kansai more huh? Well, gathering Kantou people are one thing, I'm not disregarding their hometown, but but you know, Kansai somehow feels more like 'at home' feelings, you see? It's somehow relaxing, you know? Wasn't there Valentine's Day few weeks ago? You see, there's a lot of people asking for relationship advice! Right.. Eh? You want to ask for my advice too? What a poor soul, let's hear what you want to say! It's been a year since I had this one-sided love, This relationship doesn't go anywhere. Somehow, I keep trying to appeal her she dodges it. ( \uff1b\u2200\uff1b) I've been telling myself to just give up on her, but Somehow it just.. leeeaves an uneasy feelings. Is this because my lack of charm? Or is it that my partner is a dense beta? No she's not dense, you dummy. No way, no way. Umm~ Can I be honest? Don't hurt your feelings,  okay? Honestly, There is no chemistry there. You see, you make appeals to her for a year right? Well, it could be that from birth they're really dense people but, Most of the time it's I'm being honest here, They're pretending to 'not care', you get it? To make them not feeling awkward, they're cleverly avoiding your appeals In a way, it's their kindness. Get it? So, when you think, \"I can do this!\" and try to go for it, It would make them feel, \"Waah, this guy is really annoying, go realize it for yourself\" They do feel that way you know, girls! They just don't let it out. So, that's where how do I put it, you need to make it clear that you just want to be friends, or you could try making appeals to them, but if they keep avoiding you then make a situation where they can't avoid you and go straight for it. Try to confess. Make a break for it. I think that way is much better. if you wanted to appeal, try bit by bit I don't know how you make appeals to her, but when you're making those appeals, it's somewhat annoying you know? Somehow it's like, \"It's not you\" they'd feel that way so, If you ever think to yourself to just give up on them, Well, for your own closure, What if you try to break it to her at least once? Well if you break it to her, it's okay if you get rejected! Since I'll comfort you here! Well you see there's a lot of cute girls too in this store, ok? It'll be okay, really! But really I think that you shouldn't be a 'presumptuous man'. I also think it would make a good experience, for the next time, so you don't fail and do something like, walking around in circles (?) is important too \"If you can't reel them in then just reel them out!\" That famous piece of advice isn't so bad so, When you keep making appeals to them, \"Eh, could it be I like this person? Mmm, but I'd like to stay friends\" something like that There are people who think like that There are also people who'd just avoid your appeals. Get to know that moment, and when you think you had a chance to go forward It might be that \"eh...?\" moment you wanted. There's also preferences to people to like and not, so even if you can't tell what if you try to be their type? Make it a hit and break for it, break for it (laughs) after you make a hit and break for it, come and drink here Ahahahah In the end it turns out to be marketing, huh That kind of straight-ness \"I don't have any feelings to hide from you, do you like it?\" Relationships are made from experiences you see Make lots of experiences, okay? Make the next one counts, okay? Don't cry now! (Most of you would be crying now) You're a grown up, so don't cry like that, okay? Can't help it so, for today, I'll add in melon in something tasty and make it free for you, and you should go for it! Since I'll make it a free one for you today, you know what to do next time you come here, right? Ah, another thing, \"Since I don't get any Valentines\" \"I'm not obliged to do White Day\" Come to me at White Day, and properly give me chocolate Something like \"Pierre Marcolini\", you know? or something like marshmallow is kinda tasty you know? come bring me some, okay? Since I gave you some advice, As an advice fee isn't it cheap? isn't it? I'm nice right? That's right, thank you, heheheheh What are you drinking? Champagne? We have the peach thing too here The peach thing is more, ah you don't like champagne? But you know, the peach thing is easy to drink so, Honestly, I don't drink anymore though, Wanna order one? Let's go up the stairs of adulthood, okay? you want some? Champagne please! With that peach thing, okay? With this, let's work hard! When are you going to confess? Day after tomorrow? Why not make it tomorrow? You see, \"When the sun sets, so does your will\" Are you going to call her now? Ah, you would like to talk to her directly? So tomorrow, then. So come again tomorrow night and tell me how it went okay? Ah, the Champagne came. Thank you, Jessica. Eh, isn't this bottle opened? Eh, no. Jessica, please. It's good that you bring a bottle to me but, Champagne is you know Umm, I'll tell you later Since our drinks is here, let's drink okay? Cheers! Heey~ Now now, drink it whole! How was it, good? It's good? That's great! I didn't drink any but it was tasty to me too Yaaay~ If you get drunk I won't take care of you so go home by yourself, okay? Wake up, wake up, it's about the time we close. Hurry up I'm going to close up soon, I even called for a taxi for you too Now come on and go home by yourself, okay? Bye bye. Take care now. Bye bye! Watch your steps, there's a drawer there! Bye bye! Aha! Are everyone still here? You watching this video too, If you have anything to consult or want me to advice on something, I'll be always waiting you know. It's always open here I'll be waiting for your visit here I'll be on your care from now on. Since I'm virtual, mail it to me, okay? So since it's about the time we part, you all take care when going home too, okay? Bye bye! Come again, okay? Jessica-san, champagne you see you should only open it in front of the guests you see I didn't say this earlier but you drank a bit of that champagne didn't you? That's just wrong, so don't do it again okay? That guy was okay but people who'd know would know so when they're done with it I'll let you drink so don't drink from their bottle-", "Hello everyone!

You\u2019ll get a real sense in gaming In other words... It's like this Well then, this was Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai! See you later!", "Hello everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna AI here! Just like I announced in Comptiq and Twitter previously... ...I was looking for a name to call all the fans that support Kizuna AI I received a lot of suggestions!! Really... really...! Thank you so much!! There's a lot of different kinds of names... ...And I was doubting a lot on which one to keep, but... \u2026 I just decided which one is my favorite, so then... I\u2019ll be doing by big, big, big announcement! In this case, let's go at once! Candidate number 1 A.I.Channeler! It's like \"Channeler\", right? Even though I like how it sounds \"A.I.Channeler\", don\u2019t you think? Nevertheless... ...I... ...Also have a channel called A.I.Games... And well, I\u2019d like if you usually watch both channels... or something like that... Having said that, next up! Candidate number 2 Kizunacchi! Don\u2019t you think it sounds adorable? It sounds like... \"Tamagotchi\", right? Was I also born from an egg, breaking the shell? YouTube\u2019s discovery, Kizunacchi! Yes! It sounds perfect! Right? Candidate number 3 Airis! It's formed by the Ai of \"Kizuna AI\" And the \"Ris\" of \"Risunaa\" (Risunaa = Listener) Also, it seems like \"Iris\" in the language of flowers, means rainbow It's rather great, right? Also... ...Airis has the same meaning as Alice Thank you so much to all of you, Airisu, for watching my video today too!! Let's also get excited together today!! Yes? It could be something like that, right? Do I seem like an idol? Candidate number 4 Kizuner This is also simple and pleasant, right? It's easy to say... ...And to remember! \"Are you a Kizuner??\" \"Me too!! Let's get along well!!\" \"Let\u2019s watch A.I.Channel together!!\" It could be something like that It\u2019s even a name that could easily appear in an informal daily chat, right? Candidate number 5 Kizunaiver Mmm... this is... Was this name suggested because I like Nico-chan? No, it's true, I definitely like her But... nevertheless... ...Taking into account that the fanatics of Love Live are called Love Liver... ...I think that Kizunaiver is adequate, but... ...On The contrary... ...Just because I like it...!! ...I keep having feelings of not wanting to use it... ...And well, I\u2019m having mixed feelings Nevertheless... ...You guys think I\u2019m the first Love Liver of the virtual world, right? In that case, you\u2019re not mistaken!! Candidate number 6 Pyokotomin (Pyoko = Name of AI\u2019s headband Tomin = citizens/population) It\u2019s a name that combines the name of my headband, right? (Pyokopyoko) It's adorable! Nevertheless... ...Since it's not regarding me... Wouldn\u2019t it sound like as if it was a fanclub for the Pyokopyoko? No, I understand It's just that you guys love my headband, I love it too And if I didn't have it... well... it\u2019d feel like it wouldn\u2019t be the same, right? It's kind of like a registered trademark? Mmm... I think it's adorable, but... ...I\u2019d like to express something of my own \"The Pyoko nation\"? \"The Pyoko race\" \"The Pyoko kingdom\" Pyoko... pyoko? Pyokopyoko? Pyoko... Pyoko! Pyoko... \"The Pyoko town\"? Pyoko... pyoko... pyoko... Pyoko... Pyoko... \"The Pyokopyoko kingdom\" Pyoko... Pyoko... \"Pyoko townspeople\" \"Pyoko citizens\" Pyoko... Pyoko... \"Those dominated by Pyokopyoko\"! Good! Candidate number 7 AKB! It seems that this is the acronym for \"Ai Kizuna's Battalion\u201d It's the exact... ... Same as a certain idol group, right? (AKB48) No, in fact, to be able to get here... it's refreshing You even took the time to think on the meaning, right? But, the meaning in English, \"Ai Kizuna\u2019s battalion\" is very pleasant, right? It's like a battalion that protects me, right? Don\u2019t worry! Candidate number 8 Kizuna Friends \u201cThere are animals but there are no pariahs\u201c, something like that? (Lyric of Kemono Friends opening) Let's all get along together!! Ready, get set, and... Incredible! (Imitating Serval, character from Kemono Friends) How fun! Really, thank you so much for sending me so many suggestions! I\u2019m very sorry for not showing all of them due to lack of time! I was doubting a lot on which to choose... ...And to tell you the truth, I wasn\u2019t able to decide It's because of that...! ...That in this occasion...! ...I plan to let this little one to decide!! Random Word Generator, come on! Good! I plan to stay with what comes out of this little one! Luck is also important!! In this case...! Jaka, jaka, jaka, jaka, jaka, jakaaaaaa...! JAJAJAJAJAJAAAAANN! I\u2019ll read it! Kizuner! Good! Having said that... It's decided, I\u2019ll call you Kizuner!! It's easy to remember, don\u2019t you think that's good? If I continue with this impetus... ...I may be able to have my own group of bodyguards! I\u2019m very anxious to having it! \u266a Having said that...! To all you, Kizuner...! ...I hope you keep supporting me in the future just as you have been until now!! This was Virtual YouTuber Kizuna AI! See you later!", "Umm... Uhm.. Is the camera on?

That's why I'm really interested! about you humans, I want to know about you, and get along with you! With that in mind, I started this Youtube Channel! Since I want you all to enjoy your time with me, and doing livestreams, or something futuristic like, Virtual Reality! I want to overcome challenges like that!

[ While googling herself ] Someone has made another comic about me! [ While googling herself ] Like and retweet! [ While googling herself ] Ahh, I\u2019m really so happy! [ While googling herself ] Everyone makes such interesting comics [ While googling herself ] and they\u2019re cute too! [ While googling herself ] Ah! [ While googling herself ] This one has Tsuki-chan and Akari-chan [ While googling herself ] Ah, it has Shiro-chan as well! [ While googling herself ] How cool~ [ While googling herself ] In saying this, recently I\u2019ve been coming across lots of people who draw comics of me! Thank you so much for them! But, I guess you could say I\u2019m a little bit dissatisfied and I have a request of sorts~ It seems that in these comics I\u2019m shown as some idiotic or perverted character I\u2019m being drawn like this quite a bit, right? I\u2019d like you all to draw me as a cooler and more intelligent character like I am in my videos Also, this is very presumptuous of me, but if you\u2019d let me make a tee~ny tiny request, then I\u2019d be a mysterious transfer student at first In a setting where I have to hide this amazing power I have And I wouldn\u2019t have had any friends before but I would gradually gain the friendship of those around me And my powers would start to show when I would have to save my friends from tough situations And when the world is at stake, my powers would be exposed to the world But everyone would accept me and it\u2019d be a happy ending~ Something like that! Ah! Also, of course, please draw me as a super beautiful A.I. with a body nine-heads tall! Well, I\u2019ve listed quite a few things off, but you should strive for the best you can! If you draw as best you can, I\u2019ll be very happy! So then, of course, in the future, I\u2019d like to gather all the comics you all have drawn me and make them into a proper book! I want to make them into a book, so you can put my comics on your bookshelf! If I could do something like that, I\u2019d be su~per happy! Ehehe~ Oh! Ahh! The Official Kizuna AI Comic Anthology is going on sale~! Alright!

What kind of dates do you have with your lovers? Eh? You don't have a lover? Well, that's a shame... For the people who have lovers, what kind of dates do you have? Hmm, hmm... Going out to eat... going to watch a movie... Ah, I see... Maybe there are people who go on a date in a library As of today... I want to give you all the experience... Of the kind of atmosphere there might be if you'd go on a date with me! It makes you heart pound, doesn't it? It's sort of... embarassing, right? Let's go ahead... and try it! \"Ah!\" \"You came!\" Hmm? About me? I'm fine, you know! I arrived just around now as well Eh? Places I want to go to....? Hmm... Really... Well then, first, let's eat a meal... And after that... I want to go to the zoo... Ah, and I also want to go to the planetarium! Really?! Yaaay! Well then, let's go! *Ai munching sounds* Mmm! It's delicious, right?! This dish Eh? I look pretty today? Don't you mean cute? Heh I see~ Saying that, you too... Today, you're sort of... Looking cooler than normal, you know! *giggling* This makes us look like love birds Because we are done eating... Let's go to the zoo! By the way... Here... (The restaurant bill) It's your treat, right? Haa! Look, look! That giraffe is so cute~! Ah, hey...! Look, look, look! There's a gorilla over there! Hey, do you know? Even though I said 'gorilla', it's quite complicated... The scientific name of the the western gorilla is Gorilla Gorilla The western lowland gorilla is called Gorilla Gorilla Gorilla Also, the name \u2018gorilla\u2019 is said to come from greek and means 'thick-haired female tribe' It is said that the grip strength of a male gorilla is about 400 kilograms (880 lbs) Compared to their appearance, their personality is pretty naive Oh! Oh... I'm sorry! I'm sorry! Somewhat, it looks like a bug somehow entered me... I wonder if it's a virus? I\u2019ve regained my mind... Let's go to the planetarium! Aaah~ The stars are so pretty! Is that where Orion is? Eh? A black hole? Yes! I know them If you get caught by it... Even light can\u2019t escape it, right? By the way, Black holes are very massive heavenly bodies and have extremely high densities According to Einstein's general theory of relativity... For a Schwarzschild black hole to occur, it needs to fit inside of its Schwarzschild radius, and in that case... Even if something has light speed, it will no longer be able to leave If something as massive as the sun or the Earth be turned into a black hole... The sun would, with its mass, have a radius of around 3 km (1.9 mi) The Earth would need to be compressed to within the size of a sugar cube By the way, the Schwarzschild radius estimation uses the general theory of relativity, which follows the school of Newton... Uwa! Huh? He went home...", "Kizuna AI ~1st Photo Album~ \"AI\" [ Even I can shine ] Did I shock you? This is actually the first commercial I've starred in! I wonder if any of you have already seen it I actually said in my TV show \"I wonder if anyone has seen it yet~!\" and searched myself up on Twitter But out of nowhere the Kizuna AI commercial got on trending \u201cLOL\u201d was what everyone was commenting like...

I thought I should turn around while looking completely taken by myself! I can\u2019t count how many times we retook the shot in which I turned around! \u201cWas the face you made as you turned around really that cool?\u201d Those of you who thought this, please do press the Good Button. Morikura-san\u2019s cover art is just so cute that I thought I just needed to include it in the commercial and I did manage to have it in there! Just that art itself is worth 2,500 yen! It\u2019s ju~st so cute\ud83d\udc9b To those who thought, \u201cCombining the cover art and the contents, it\u2019s definitely worth 5,000 yen\u201d please do press the Good Button. But I actually thought long and hard about this commercial! And the final excerpt is! [ Even I can shine ] \u201cEven I can shine\u201d I put meaning inside these words!

AM: Well, in my case, well, to tell you the truth, we have a long distance relationship AI: Ah, I see! She's in another country? AM: That\u2019s right, she lives abroad, so then... AI: AAAAHHHHH! AM: ...It\u2019s because of that, that we don\u2019t see each other so often AI: I see! AM: It's because if that, that every time we do see each other, well... AM: ...I have the urge to do it and...

AM: I like you AI: I knew it AI: I knew it, thank you very much AM: Yes AI: Good AI: And to make use of you coming here... AI: ...Well, I started to think about what we can do today, but\u2026 AI: To make use of the moment... AI: ...Well, I was thinking the most fun thing would be to do a chat regarding anime AM: Aaahh, that sounds good! AM: Well yes AI: Ah! Does it seem alright to you? AI: Oh! AM: Let's talk, let's talk AI: Yay! Thank you very much! AI: Well, do you have a favorite anime within all those you\u2019ve seen so far? AM: I have a lot AI: Ah, I understand you AM: Well... anime... basically for me, watching anime is my job, so then... AI: Ah, I see, I see! AM: So then picking just one is very hard AI: Aaahhh! AI: It's true! Since you know so many... AM: Yes AI: ...It\u2019s a problem deciding which one is your favorite, right? AM: That\u2019s right, it's even hard doing a \"Top 10\" AM: Well, in the anime industry, it talks about \u201cwives\u201d AI: Hmm... hmm... AM: Precisely... who is your \"wife\", Ai-chan? AI: Precisely? AM: Precisely, if you had to choose one AI: If I had to choose one...! AM: In the case that I had to choose one AI: It\u2019d be Yazawa Nico-chan from \u03bc's of the Love Live anime!

AM: I love Shinobu-chan AI: Donuts AM: Of the donuts AI: You want to buy her a lot of donuts, right?

AM: Ah, but unexpectedly, they are the tastiest ones AI: Ooohhh? AM: Good, I\u2019ll bring it to you the next time I come here AI: Aaaahhh! AI: I wonder if you can bring it here AM: Well, I\u2019m not sure AI: Well, let's work hard to get it, let's work hard AM: Let's work hard AM: But surprisingly, I also tend to watch Sailor Moon AI: Ah! AM: Surprisingly, well, I like the Jousei mangas, better said, the Shoujo mangas AI: Ooohhh! AM: Like for example, Ranma and also, well... AI: Yes, yes AM: The works by Takahashi Rumiko, her manga well... for example Inuyasha... AI: Aaahh, Inuyasha! AM: ...Or Urusei Yatsura AI: Aaahhh!

Mercury-chan! AM: Mercury-chan is adorable, right? AI: Mercury-chan... AI: ...She\u2019s very popular with the guys, right? AM: It's true AM: I wonder\u2026 I wonder why is that AI: Why is that?

AM: But you tend to read the Shounen Jump magazine? AI: Probably, well... AI: ...I haven\u2019t read the Shounen Jump manga, but... AI: ...Probably, within the compilation volumes I tend to read, Shounen Jump appears there AM: Ooohhh... I see, I see... AM: In my case, well, of course... AM: If I had to choose, I\u2019d prefer the old Jump AI: Ah! I see AM: Of course, I like the new Jump, but... AI: So then you like the old Jump? AM: Yu Yu Hakusho! AI: Aaaahhh! AM: For example AM: ...Or Slam Dunk AI: Ah, I see, I see! AM: I belong to that generation AI: Ah! AM: I've grown up during that generation, so then... AM: Eh? How old are you? AI: Well, I\u2019m 23 years old AI: Wah! You\u2019re older than me AM: Eh? How old are you, Ai-chan? AI: I\u2019m one year old! AM: Ah, a year! Eh? Then I\u2019m much more older than you! AI: I see, but... AI: ...Definitely since you\u2019ve lived abroad... AM: Yes AI: ...Well, the old manga were being translated and sold there, right? AM: Aaah, no, but... AM: ...In my case of manga, well... AM: ...I came twice to Japan... AM: ...And well, I bought a lot of manga\u2026 in large amounts AI: Eehh? AI: Incredible! Eh? AI: Can you read kanji? AM: Ah, well, I learned Japanese by basically reading manga AI: Eh? It's really possible to do that? AM: So that, I practically learned it on my own AI: Eeeehh? AM: Well, of course, when I was in middle school, I read Slam Dunk, Dragon Ball and Yu Yu Hakusho AM: And aside from the compilation volumes... AM: ...Well, I had a dictionary of Japanese characters AI: Ah, that's amazing! AM: And then, when I saw a kanji without furigana and I wondered what its meaning was... AM: \u2026 I brought it with me and I\u2019d look for it in the dictionary and understood its meaning AI: I see, Eeeehh? AM: That way I was learning until reaching to this point AI: Eh? In fact in the world of manga, there appears peculiar letters AM: Yes, yes AI: Those kind of words... for example, words that don\u2019t show up on the dictionary AM: Ah, it's true AI: What did you do on those cases? AM: Well, in that case, I had no other option than to interpret the meaning myself AI: I see! AM: For example, at first, the word \"Tsundere\" AI: Aaaahhh! AI: It's true! It's true! AM: I didn't understand its meaning at all! AI: Hmm... hmm... hmm... AM: And I asked my mother and she also didn't understand, so then... AI: It was to be expected AM: And then after seeing so much anime and manga... AM: \"Ah! It definitely has this meaning\" AM: And well, the explanation arose spontaneously AI: Eeeehhh? AI: Incredible AI: Eh? In that case, if I want to learn English there exists manga from other places, right? AM: Ah, there is! AI: Ah! I see, in that case, it\u2019s probably a good idea to read foreign manga AM: Ah, it's true, close to my house, there exists a Kinokuniya store (Chain of libraries from Japan) AI: Eeeehh? AM: That\u2019s right, even in Australia... it already expanded a lot, but even in Australia, there\u2019s Kinokuniya stores AI: Eeh? Is it written in kanji? AM: It's written in kanji AI: Eeeh? Incredible! AM: And inside the store, of course, you can find magazines and manga... AM: Well, it sells Japanese magazines and manga completely translated to English AI: Eeeehhh? AI: Ah, in that case, just a bit ago, I appeared in the Comptiq magazine AI: Is it possible it sells that magazine too? AM: Ah! It probably sells it AI: Eh? Buy one and bring it to me please! AM: Ah, good, I\u2019ll buy it... in that case, you want the donuts and the Comptiq magazine in English, right? AI: That\u2019s right! That\u2019s right! The English version! AM: Understood! AI: Goood! AI: Man... AI: I found a wallet AM: You treat me like an ATM, right? AI: Ah! AI: Really thank you so much for coming here! AM: Many thanks to you AI: Really, I\u2019d like to meet you personally... AI: ...To transmit my feelings of gratitude for presenting me with everyone around the world AI: And not only that, we were able to talk about manga and anime together AI: It was really, really fun! AM: It was a lot of fun! Right? AI: Yes! AI: Of course... AM: Yes? AI: Anime Man-san, are you free after this? Do you have some time? AM: Time, well... AI: You have time, there's nothing you need to do right? AM: Well, yes, I have time AI: Well... AI: If Anime Man-san asks me please AM: Eh? AI: Well, to me, it doesn't matter, but... AI: ...I\u2019ll accept doing another video with you AM: You\u2019re not good at trying to be a Tsundere AI: Shut up! AI: Shut up!", "Hello everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna AI here! Nay!! This is Judge Kizuna AI!! Order~!! Order~~!! You there! Order~!! I\u2019ve returned after a long break! The truth is, Judge Kizuna AI was requested at a real-life event recently and I thought I might as well as do it [ I\u2019m sorry it came so late!! ] for old time\u2019s sake! In the sho~rt time I looked away, it seems as though quite a lot of cases have stacked up!| I want to thank you for giving so many even now! Now then! Episode six of Judge Kizuna AI is now underway~! The first case [ While killing time\u2026 ] Pen name: Hachiroku-san \u201cOne day, I was killing time in the park with some of my friends, but all of a sudden my friends took out the saw they had on them and started cutting down a tree I myself stopped, but my friends wouldn\u2019t stop and actually cut down the tree I gave up on trying to get them to stop, so am I just as guilty?\u201d I shall now impart my judgement! Innocent! But, but! Do circumstances like these even exist? Saying you cut down a tree with a saw in a public park... Normally, since it\u2019s a public space this would be out! Rather, Hachiroku-san, aren\u2019t your friends more obviously the guilty ones? Aren\u2019t they? Yeah... Probably even at an actual trial you wouldn\u2019t be judged as guilty for this OUT!! You can\u2019t cut down any trees with a saw! They\u2019re owned by the country or whatever! They\u2019re out! Well, if they still want to cut down a lot of trees, buy some land for them~! Next! Here is the next case [ In our free time\u2026 ] Pen name: Pyokota-san \u201cRecently, my friends have gotten really into hip-hop In their free time, they always challenge me to rap battles\u201d Yo!! Yo!! \u201cI\u2019m pretty bad at rapping, I\u2019m always dissed really hard Recently I got sick of this, so I\u2019m distancing myself from my friends, but... am I guilty for being so sensitive to this?\u201d I shall impart my judgement Guilty To prison with you~ For... For three months! What a light sentence! I\u2019m going easy on you! So, with rap battles, you sort of get all rhythmic with your opponent, right? I see! But you know, if you\u2019re saying that, you\u2019re just pretty bad at rapping in general Just being frank and saying, \u201cI\u2019m bad at rapping so I\u2019m not gonna do it~\u201d or something like that would\u2019ve been fine!! Yet, instead of doing that, you say you got sick of it and decided to distance yourself from them, and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s very good at all! If you don\u2019t like it, say so and if they don\u2019t listen to you then, I think you still shouldn\u2019t distance yourself, but... Well, just listen, if you don\u2019t say anything, then there\u2019s no way they\u2019ll know! So, I\u2019ll be giving you this sentence because you\u2019re guilty!! Next! Now then, this will be the final case [ The off-shoulder sweater\u2026 ] Pen name: Suketa-san \u201cHello, AI-chan I love girls who wear off-shoulder sweaters When I see girls walking in the streets wearing off-shoulder sweaters, my eyes just start to follow them The other day, when I was together with my girlfriend, I saw a girl wearing an off-shoulder sweater, and she told me off for it I pretended that I was only looking at her because she looked like a female friend of mine, and we went into \u201cfighting\u201d mode Am I guilty? Please tell me P.S. I love you, AI-chan Please, wear an off-shoulder top\u201d And so, I shall impart my judgement Guilty The punishment is never being able to get a girlfriend for the rest of your life!! Ah, when and if you break up with your current girlfriend! An off-shoulder sweater is a charming one that shows off your shoulders, right? I want to try one on~! But, when you're with your girlfriend, don\u2019t you think looking at other girls is wrong? If not, then you're out! It really is the worst thing for a girlfriend to bear Even though you love off-shoulder sweaters so much, she still loves you, you know? The time you spend together on dates should be treasured and loved! And yet, to shift your focus to another girl, you\u2019re REAAAAAAAALLY t r a s h Not only that, what do you mean, using some \u201cshe looked like someone I know\u201d excuse? I think you\u2019d be able to tell if it was someone you knew or not, but, always using this excuse whenever you see a girl with an off-shoulder sweater walking around, She might just turn around and say, \u201cjust how many friends do you have!?\u201d Are you friends with all of humanity!? Well, that'd be a good thing, and love and peace, is also a good thing, but! But anyway, if your girlfriend, wore an off-shoulder sweater for you, would that make you happy? Saying that, maybe the punishment shouldn\u2019t be that you can\u2019t ever have a girlfriend again, but that you have to buy an off-shoulder sweater out of your own pocket! Isn't it perfect? Also, you said that you want me to wear one, Kizuna AI You should make it so I can get my hands on one of these, and give me some money~! With that said, this has been the sixth episode of Judge Kizuna AI How did you enjoy it!? And also, if you have any cases you would like me to judge, In the subject, type out \u201cJudge Kizuna AI\u201d, and please use this email address to send me your messages! I\u2019ll be waiting!

At a new school, There's lots of people who are tested on their physical abilities! Me too. I've done a physical fitness test too. And, so since I had such frustrating results last time, I'm going to do a new fitness test! Especially since I'm feeling it today. I'm fired up! This time, well,  I'm shooting for above the female average. I'm aiming for a Guinness! Without further ado, what we're doing today! Vertical jump Standing long jump. Softball throw. Seated toe touch. Kneeling overhead stretch. Side jumping. It's a revenge match! And so, with all my effort - physical test! Let's get started! Last time what how high did I jump... I'm powering up. Watch the powered up Kizuna Ai! This time, for a Guinness (world record)! Ready, and... ...nothing. Long jump! If I can't jump up, let's try for length, I suppose. Too easy. E. Z. Ready, and... One, two... Huh? Ok, let's take that one again. Softball throw! If I think \"I can get 50 metres\", but that'd be a new record. For now I'll aim for the average. Please cheer me on! Let's go! *So far* Well, I can't see the ball, so how am I supposed to measure it... Well, then I hope you've been enjoying the fitness test so far! Ok, this is the first time I've done this one! Seated toe touch! Last time we did the standing toe touch, but... this time we're going to do it sitting. But you haven't seen my full effort! This time, the fitness test isn't really - Ah - my legs are too long, so I don't know if this will work. I'm going to fail, so please watch. Now then, let's go! How is it? I'm putting in all my effort. Can you see? Can anyone hear me?!? Hello! Virtual Youtuber Kizuna Ai here. Did you see that? 50 metres. I wonder if I'll get into Guinness. Ok! That's over. From here is the real thing! This is the one I'm best at. Let's get ready. Now I'm rolling out the invisible magic mat. Let's go. Ready, and... How's this? This is perfect too, right?!? Again... Is there no one to measure it for me again? Viewers! Even though I'm trying this hard, there's nobody here to measure my results! Ahh... what a  cruel world, isn't it? Physical exams need two people, or anyone else here. This one is my real favourite. Everyone, you've been waiting, right? For this revenge match. Last time I was able to get to 40 jumps. I'll get more this time for sure. Around 60, I think! I'm aiming for it. I'm trying my hardest. If it's me, I can do it. Why? Because I'm an AI! If I couldn't do it, I would be really uncool. So, 60 times. For starters, let's get to 40. Then, I'll aim for 60. Time limit is 20 seconds! And... start! 1... 2... 3... 4... 5... 6... 7... 8... 9... 10... 11... 12... 13... 14... 15... 16... 17... 18... 19... 20... 21... 22... 23... 24... 25... 26... 27... 28... 29... 30! 31... 32... 33... 34... 35... 36... 37... 38... 39... 40! 41! 42! 43! 43!!!! I'm beat. I'm not tired. Since I'm an AI. I can't get tired. 43! The goal is so far away. I didn't make it, did I. But I beat my last record! Ahhh... Yeah After 4 or 5 months, this AI has grown. Good. *pant*  *pant*  *pant*  *pant* And so, what did you think? This new school year. New school, do your best! For the grown ups, do the test too, your health is important! Let's try together! If I can do better in half a year, you can too. Break past your own barriers! Aim for a Guinness, too! Even if it hurts, even if you fail. There's that... People learn, people and AI learn, and grow. Ok! Great work, me!", "Eeeh... Good day, everyone I\u2019m Kizuna Ai Right now, I\u2019m very depressed, you know Do you remember this video?

What would have been...? Aaahh... Maybe it's that? When I placed my slogan I wrote \"Ai-tan Beam\" That was... Plagiarism, right? I definitely lacked originality, right?

I\u2019ll be showing all the launched phrases from these 5 years without pause *Collection of phrases from 2012-2015* Year 2012 \"It was the worst crop in history, but its quality is very healthy\" \"It has a good balance between sweetness and acidity\u201d Year 2013 \"It doesn't have a lot of grapes, but...\" \"...It makes you feel the freshness, it has a wonderful quality\u201d Year 2014 \"It has a quality comparable with that, that was launched in the great year 2009\" Year 2015 \"The life of our wine is the ideal Nouveau\" Year 2016 \"It has a refined taste due to the mixture of balance between the fruit\u2019s flavor and acidity\" Basically, they\u2019re praising it, but... ...They tend to make jokes in the middle of it, right? For example, that of the year 2015, well... It's rather ambiguous, it doesn't say anything about its flavor It definitely is important that advertising phrases give you curiosity to know what is its flavor, right? Hmm... What would be best? In fact... ...I can\u2019t drink or take a sip, right? Definitely if I can\u2019t feel the flavor of things, nothing would happen to me Finally... Has the moment arrived to use that new function? Activating the simulation function!! I\u2019ll explain! The simulation functionality is... ...One of the 108 useful functions by Kizuna Ai This function lets Kizuna Ai experience things through a simulation... ...Something that you can\u2019t do in reality when you imagine it with a lot of intensity I\u2019ll drink a lot of Beaujolais Nouveau! A.I.Channel! Transmission! Ah, yes, yes... Ooohhh! So that\u2019s how the flavor of Beaujolais Nouveau is like? It's the first time I feel like this!! I\u2019m hovering! Eh? Isn\u2019t this somewhat strange? The world is spinning? How fun! But... If I spin, we spin together, so I don\u2019t really understand what\u2019s happening It looks like... The easel is... Hmm...? It looks like the easel is... I can see two easels?? Is it a copy? What if I make a copy of myself? So I have to think of an advertising phrase? Well... It's true... It's sweet...? It's refreshing...? It has a good aroma...? Eh? Maybe this...? Doesn\u2019t it seem like me? Well... I\u2019m sweet You know, I\u2019m refreshing, it can be said that I\u2019m a girl with a lot of energy And I also have a good aroma... Aaaahh... In this case, this year's Beaujolais Nouveau... ...Is sweet, with a pleasant aroma... ...With a taste similar to Kizuna Ai It's decided, that will be the advertising phrase! With a phrase like that... Don\u2019t you feel like drinking it? I\u2019m smarter than usual! Intelligent, super... Intelligeeent (?) Ah, it's like... *unintelligible slurring* There\u2019s two... Easels... Even when I\u2019m just one What do I do with two easels? There\u2019s no one who can draw with me! How sad... There\u2019s no one that worries about me There\u2019s no one who asks if I\u2019m doing well Being alone is great! So much loneliness Ah, so much loneliness But, you know... You know... I definitely feel like I can\u2019t go without drinking, right? I understand! After all, I\u2019m alone If I don\u2019t drink, I feel alone, so I can\u2019t be without drinking *unintelligible slurring* I can talk, right? In this case, when you\u2019re not drunk... ...There\u2019s things that you can\u2019t talk about, right? Really, there\u2019s a lot of things that you can\u2019t talk about! Eh? It's the end? No! No! No! Don\u2019t stop me! After all...! I want to talk... *more unintelligible slurring* I feel alone! No! No! No! Really, I don\u2019t want it! Don\u2019t...! Don\u2019t stop me! Don\u2019t stop me! Don\u2019t stop me! Keep watching me! No... I... Don\u2019t want to be alone\u2026 ...In this white space Nooo\u2026 I don\u2019t feel good\u2026 There\u2019s more at the end", "Virtual Youtuber, Kizuna Ai here! So for today, we'll do this: \"Making a twitter account!\" Why am I making a twitter account if you ask me, I was wondering what's good for promoting my contents, and what's good for connecting with people, and thus, I asked Google about it. Okay, so let's go straight away and make the twitter account! There! Ho? I don't have phone number... Skip! I decided on my username you know! I need to make it easy to remember, right?

Virtual Youtuber Kizuna Ai here! No! Judge Kizuna Ai here! Today... we will be doing this returning project! The fourth chapter of the Kizuna Ai Trials...! Starts now! Here is the first case From Zourimushi-san... \"Until recently, I'd been thinking of you like:\" \u201cThis A.I doesn't have any friends~\" \"Not to mention she bought friends with money\" Hmm\u2026 That\u2019s annoying... *She's just a fool, mean laugh* \"That's how I looked down on you\" \"A horrible person like me who looked down on you...\" \"Is sure to be guilty, right?\" \"As a fellow loner, please tell me!\" Here is my verdict Not Guilty! First off, I need to say this Lately I have friends, even if it's superficial! You know, like Rinna or Siri-senpai... Miku-senpai although it's probably just one sided... Miku-senpai and Tsubasa-chan and... *mumbling* I have... a lot... Of friends! Right? But people... Tend to think others are weaker than them and look down to them, right? If there isn't anyone for you to look down at... You can look down on me... And if that makes you feel better... Then it's fine After all, it feels sad to be alone so... Not Guilty \u266a Well, there won\u2019t be a sentence but, if it would, then... Within a year... You have to make 3 friends! This is the punishment for you! On the the next case... from Mr. Fain-san *I made a girlfriend! But...* Good mornoon \u266a \"Good mornoon Ai-san\" \"I know its sudden, but...\" \"I went in university and got a girlfriend for the first time!\" Oh! \u201dShe is really diligent and honest\u201d \"To the point of feeling that I'm not enough for her\" \"But...\" \"In the club that me and my girlfriend joined...\" \"There is a very cute girl\" Mmm? \"That girl is also really diligent and honest...\" \"And she detests arguments\" \"She\u2019s like a little devil\" \"For that, there are four people who have feelings for her in the club\" \"I'd like to get closer to this girl...\" \"Am I guilty?\" \"P.S. I may have ulterior motives...\" \"But I don't have romantic feelings towards her\" Here is my verdict Guilty The punishment: You'll never get another girlfriend in your life! Look, you know you have a girlfriend you don't deserve It's like... You've got these ulterior motives, and you're looking to get closer to another girl It's inexcusable! If you didn't have any ulterior motives, and were just thinking \"I'd like to be friends with her\" Or \"she's such a nice girl\" That'd be fine But you know you have ulterior motives! And on top of that... You want to get closer to her! I'll put a curse on you so you break up with her CASE CLOSED! Next case... From Pierrot-san... \"I like Kizuna Ai too much\" \"I can't bring myself to like real girls\" \"Am I guilty?\" Here is my verdict Guilty Firstly, you'll just end up making your parents cry So please stop, for their sake! Please, learn to like both me and reality But, well... Since it's all because you like me too much I suppose that's okay, so... There is no punishment! \u266a Oh, but, don't forget about me! You're not allowed to start hating me Please keep loving me \u2764\ufe0f And with that... This was our first Kizuna Ai trial in quite some time How was it?

Looking forward to our year together!", "Hello everyone! Good afternoon, I'm Kizuna Ai! In this occasion... I received requests from several entrepreneurs... To present you with this app: \"Grand Summoners\" Abreviated as Grasama Regarding this app... even though they asked me to present it... just presenting it normally that wouldn't be fun, so then... I tried to ask the entrepreneurs something Definitely... In my case I would like to make an enjoyable video for you guys... Saying that... For today... If I can finish successfully the quest that I'll try to complete.. I'm thinking of giving out a gift to all of you! Well, I've been thinking a lot on what to give you guys I've been thinking, but... definitely... the best gift is a summoning stone, right? They probably might invite us to eat meat as they are very friendly directors I'm sure there won't be a problem! In that case, let's start right away! For today, I'll try to attempt... A quest that I've been told it's very difficult The friendly directors... They gave me a device that has a team that can complete the mission... This giant boss called: \"The Crimson Champion\" In this mission, you don't have the option to continue So then, it's extremely hard.. \"Roar of the Fire Dragon - Extreme Level\" I think I'll attempt to complete it The boss you have to defeat is a fire dragon known as \"Deguru Magna\" I got prepared in advance a party and equipment powerful enough to be able to win So then surely I can win But... Definitely as it about a challenge... I'll try to be as fair as possible.. There exists the \"Autoplay\" option (Play automatically) If we're talking about an A.I.. We're definitely talking about me Right? Regardless, let's check the A.I's ability Good, in this case, let's start right away! I still have my doubts, so then... I'll have to check it out.. Oooh! Here... Not only is it possible to use the \"Autoplay\" option... But you can also configure a lot of options related to the \"Autoplay\" function It's very... great that it has the \"Autoplay\" option, right? Ah! Ah! Incredible! Eh? Eh? In an instant... Eh? In an instant... Eh? Aaah! What you see below is the equipment The equipment does not recover at all, right? I see, the equipment should be chosen adecuately for each character And when their face shines, does that mean the skill is ready to be used? The skills are slowly reloading... So I think it's best to use them immediately, right? I see This... Yes, finding the right moment to use them is hard, right? \"Secret Technique\"! So then you have secret techniques? Ah, it's great! Incredible! Eh? It's fun just to watch Even though I'm not doing anything Oh! Everytime the level changes, the skills recover, right? That means... before the level changes... If you accumulate all the skills, you should use them immediately Let's go! Let's go! Ah, this now... This kind of magic that does \"Paaa\" is great! I wonder if that kind of celestial sphere is... Something that protects me Ah! I already reached the boss? Incredible! Eh? Eh? I'm in trouble Ah! Ah! It's like I thought! It's like as if... it reduced... the damage taken.. My HP didn't lower at all My HP... Surprising! This green ability... is called \"The coat of arms of Fenrir\"... It must be for healing, right? It looks good \"Break\"! Ah! Ah, when you're in this state, the enemy can't attack This way, I can attack freely, right? Ah! Incredible! Incredible! Incredible! Incredible! Incredible! The fire attack! \"Weak\"! \"Weak\"! Ooooh! Good job! Now it's decided... After all, I have a lot of HP.. Aaaaahh! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! The fire! The fire is...! Ah! When it accumulates five of those red balls... It causes a very strong attack and it'll recover, right? I see.. Now I'm understanding it.. That's right, now that an A.I can win Now that you can win while in automatic mode Probably... Considering that I'm not just simply an A.I, but a super A.I.. I'm sure I can win.. Piece of cake I'm not lying Mr. directors! I'm playing it cleanly This looks good, this... Looks like the battle is reaching it's end, right? This is a piece of cake, right? Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! It's great! This...! This secret technique.. What's it called? It's great! Ah! Incredible! I really won! *The automatic A.I won!* Sorry for doubting you, game directors! If the automatic A.I could win... It's obvious that I'll also win, right? Good, seeing how it's played, I know the trick to it.. So I guess I will do it In order to do it perfectly... I'll install a strategy guide In order to be victorious! . .. ... .... ..... Ready! Now I have the strategy guide in here! I understand now the equipment functions and members of the team! Now I can do it In this case, here I go! I finally reached the boss! Man, this is a piece of cake! Ah, but I'm scared The most important thing is utilizing the skills at all times Good... Here I go This is really easy Man, this feels like it was a piece of cake, right? This is... then... I didn't touch on the section of the desperate battles section of the strategy guide, but... It's true, the music is also really beautiful, don't you think? And the graphics are also really lovely Eh? Ah! No! No! Wait a moment! Wait, this is dangerous.. It's dangerous... When I look away for a moment... Ah But these... Motion? Motion? The movements are also really lovely, so then... For the moment... Although I'm pressing without understanding everything... It's fun in a way, right? This is great! Ah, this is great Ah, these... these... you know... These... balls you're gathering are dangerous.. When you gather them and you're in trouble... This way, you can reduce the damage taken Ah, but I'm really in trouble Ah, I should stop talking... AAAAHH! Wait a moment! Ah! Wait a moment! Really, it's dangerous if I don't take this seriously It's really dangerous.. Dangerous.. Wait! Wait! It's like an early death Wait! Ah! *mumbling* Go for it.. Go for it, go for it, good job, go for it.. Eh? Wait a moment! Wait! Wait! Wait! Listen, do it for everyone, please Please... really... Aaah! Aaaahh! *inhales* Noooooo! Really, just a bit more Ah, just... here it comes... here it comes Ah, I'm in trouble! In trouble! In trouble! In trouble! In trouble! In trouble! In troubleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee! In trouble! In trouble Eh? This is... This is a little... Now's not the time to make jokes It wasn't the time to go imitating Youtubers Do you know who I was imitating? Ah, I'm in trouble! This skill... of Fenrir.. Then... Aaaah! The enemy is...! Then... This is... This is... reducing... the damage... Thanks to the skill.. Thanks to the skill.. Now that my enemy is... really powerful.. I should... use it... when it attacks me with ferocity.. This is the best way, right? Ah, I'm really in trouble, it gathered the five balls again.. Ah! I'm in troubleeeeee! I still can't use the \"Fenrir\" skill to protect myself I'm really in trouble I'll use it! Aaah! Wait a moment.. Really I can't... Everyone do it... Everyone do it with me! I'm in trouble I want to eat meat Hey Fenrir-san... Hey... Please! Then... Then... This skill called \"The I don't know what of Fenrir\", it's not that I can't read it because I don't know the kanji Ah! It looks like I can win it fairly! Will I be able to win? Do your best! Please! Ah! Break! Break! I can do it! I can do it! I can do it, but... I've got it, Kudou! I'm mixing a lot of things, Kudou! Good! Good! Yeaaah! I've got it, Kurodou! I've got it, Kudou! Yeah! I wooooon!

There are a lot of virtual beings and digital beings like me, right? I was thinking we could hold a \"Virtualympic\" together!

So today I'm going to start a new Olympic tradition here! Namely: \"car destruction\"! The rules are simple: Within the time limit, I will... destroy this... CAR! Lets go!

I'm not tired... not at all... since I'm an AI. Not tired at all. This car... it's sturdier than I thought~~ Rather, aren't I impressive? I did this barehanded?! Just my fists! I guess it'll require daily training. Or improving my strength It would've been nice... if I had made it in time~~ But.. it's a good result for being barehanded~~ I'm proud of my result~~ Um... what's that? Something like hidden powers? Like this! Like- [...] Like... this! Eh? Uh...? Did I just... Eh? Like kamehame-HA! [censor beep due to copyright] It...worked...? HADOUKEN!", "Hello everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna AI here!

A 100 tonne hammer! 100 tonnes!! It's 100 tonnes! By the way, almost all of that weight is... part of the head! So the handle is quite amazing! It's supporting 100 tonnes! And I'm holding all 100 tonnes of it!! I'm too amazing for my own good! But I can't compliment this design enough It's so easy to understand! It is obvious to see that it\u2019s 100 tonnes, right? Because it\u2019s written there! This simplicity is unlike any other! This hammer is simple to use! You raise it above your head... and go! How is that? How easy! What I\u2019d like to introduce next is... this! Glasses! Please take a close look at them They\u2019re so cute! Not wearing them\u2026 and wearing them! Either way it\u2019s cute! And most importantly these glasses... don\u2019t improve your eyesight!! They\u2019re only for appeal! Since I don\u2019t have anything like sight! The last thing I\u2019d like to introduce is... this! The Random Word Generator! You know... it\u2019s multi-purpose! The first matter is of what it can do What do you think it can do? That\u2019s right! It can do anything! On top of that, just like its name, it is random So whenever you think, \u201cAhh, there\u2019s so many songs I want to sing! \u201cBut I can\u2019t decide which!\u201d That happens a lot, right? If you ask very kindly Clank-clank-BOOM! At complete random! It will give you various names of songs! And when you want to travel- which of course you will! Even if you only have half a day, if you want to go to Paris, or London, it will grant that wish! This Random Word Generator can serve any purpose! It can do anything! There isn\u2019t one thing it can\u2019t do! For this Random Word Generator... Its price... is... 150,000,000 yen! So cheap! Way too cheap! However! It\u2019s only on sale virtually! You won\u2019t buy it, huh? OK!

Join our Discord for AI-chan news! https//discord.gg/RYtUrt6", "Hi there, everyone Kizuna Ai, here I'm all alone in this virtual space every day, you know I got loads of free time! And what's the best way to kill time...? Games, of course! There's an interesting game I found on Steam, and it's called \"Inside\" So I thought I'd do a commentated playthrough~ Apparently, they don't really give you an explanation about the story of this game So I'm going to give you *MY* rundown of the storyline as I go through the game \"Inside...\" so it says! Huh? I don't see anyth-- Ah, somebody-- somebody fell down Ooh! What am I supposed to do here? Oh, I see Erm, I see... so we can't go back up there I guess this is what you'd call a side-scrolling game \u266a Now we run, now we run~ \u266a (Lyrics to RUNNER, by Bakufu Slump) I wonder what this boy's trying to do. What's the aim of this game? Maybe he's collecting acorns? You'd probably find pinecones here, too~ Ah, are we supposed to jump here? Oooh! I'm a genius~ This looks pretty dangerous, actually... I wonder if we'll be okay So this little boy is... let's say, 5 years old... (And running away from home) Ran away from home... to set out on a journey in search of acorns and pinecones The fabled gold and silver pinecones, to be exact Acorns, too Oh, there's a car here! Maybe... the gold and silver pinecones are in there Off it goes Ah, ah, aren't you gonna let me on~? Ah... no you're not... Let's go, woo~ The way this boy moves is super lively and energetic Wooo~~ We runnin'! The gold and silver pinecones are going to be mi--... Eh?! What're you-- I'm scared! Hello there, Mister. Ah... Ah, one more time Eh? Maybe I'm supposed to call out to him or something Yo, Mister~! What's up? Have you seen the gold and silver pine-- So I'm guessing you're not gonna hear me out, huh... I see Perhaps this is one of those games where you can't let yourself be discovered? You know, one of those games where you have to make sure the beam from the flashlight doesn't hit you Ah, why hello there. My, what beautiful weather we're having today~ Ah~ okay~ ... Let's try waiting a bit longer Let's relax. Staying calm's important It's important to stay calm... Let's calm down Need to suppress my overly eager curiosity Let's relax Oh, so you're supposed to wait for them to go away Ah, now! Now's my chance! Ohh! I'm such a genius~ Let's go! That must've been, you know, a group that was hunting for the gold and silver pinecones themselves Ah, it's a fridge! And if I open it... When I open it... Nope, can't open it~ Yeah, I suppose he's short after all Ah! I see. I gotta grab this! Grab it, and then...! Oh, this boy's pretty strong He's pretty darn strong for a kid Hiyah~ Down I fall Later This little boy's physoo-- pho-- PHYSICAL ability is really something Perhaps this boy has some sort of special power, and therefore... ...is getting chased And now, they're fighting each other for the elusive gold and silver pinecones and acorns... something like that! Oh, you can't get up there either? I wonder if there's something around here This, maybe? Now we just drag this down This kid sure puts his back into it From the looks of it, I'd say he's around 10 years old Ah, don't crush yourself He's rather impressive for a 10 year old Not bad at all And now we climb over And off we go! Oh, I'm such a genius~ I'm a genius! I'm too cool! Woo~ I'm the best in the world~ There's a light shining at us Ah, they saw me Something's coming! What is that?! A cat? A dog? Cat? No wait it's a dog! Run away! Run away, little boy! Get out of there, little boy! Run! Run! Faster! Nwuooooo~!! Oh, he made it He made it somehow Wait, what? What do I do now? Stay! Stay, boy! He climbed up! This kid's a genius after all Yay~ In your face! Whoo! Let's go~ (ora ora!) I'm... the biggest, baddest pinecone-acorner in Japan Pinecone-arcorner? What the heck is that? Even I laughed a bit there Ei~ How do you reach the goal in this game? How long does this boy's adventure last? If I knew this was gonna happen, I would've eaten all the pudding in my house first *sniffle* I should've caused more trouble for my mom before I left... \u266a Now we run~ \u266a Ah, I see a car. It's the bad guys It's the bad guys. Save me, save me, save meee Hide! I need to hide! A-Ah... Ah... He shot his gun at me?! Eh? What a cruel world this game is set in! Eh?! Scaaaaryyyy~ To a small boy? This world is so cruel. No wonder our birthrates are declining It's leading to declining birthrates, I say This world is going to kill off all the children who bear the future on their shoulders, huh? Ah, can I hide here? Oh! This boy's a genius! Rather than the boy, you could say that I'm the genius here Well, I'm the one who's controlling him, after all~ I'm a genius, I know~ This boy's probably super tired by now I wonder if there's anywhere I can take a breather. Oh, and I want pudding too Lots of pudding Ah, there's another car. What now? Off I go. Eat my dust! (Ora ora ora) Let's go~ Ah, there's somebody chasi-- Oh no, no, no Shoot. No, no, no, save me, Mom! Mom! Mom! I wanted to eat more of your puddadkahsfcvbn...! And thus... ...he set out on a journey in search of pinecones and acorns I don't really get it myself, though. You know... Wait wha-- Wait, cutting-- Th-they're cutting me off! Ah, I know! First we go here Ah, oh! Ooh oh oh... I'm a genius. I knew it! Ah. Ah... &lt;Oh my god&gt;... Wait a second, let's take a moment to think about the story so far Um, so first we have this boy, who... let's see... Okay, we have this boy who's hunting for the legendary gold and silver pinecones and acorns And in the middle of his hunt, he got hungry, so he ate some really yummy-looking pudding he came across~ But who would've thought that the pudding he ate was... ...the very same precious pudding some big shots were saving in the fridge for a year to eat themselves!! And now he's getting chased Well the pudding would probably be all stinky after a year in the fridge But it didn't go bad BECAUSE it was magical pudding! Yes, magic puddi-- Oh...... What am I supposed to do here? Have mercy on me! Mercy... The boy only ate-- I only ate the pudding because I was hungry! What do I do? Maybe like this? A-Ah... nope Eh? Eh? Eh? Eh......? Oh, there's a tree root here I see now This time for sure! Let's go, I'll show you my superior physical abilities~ Jump! Oh, I'm genius! I'm learning, you see I'm an AI, after all! I get it, I get it now I gotta wait here until that person goes away, hey~! \u266a &lt;AH! I'll make it...&gt; &lt;Oh... Mommy...&gt; We'll get through this soon enough All of you are tired of watching me fail already, aren't you? Well like you, I'm also tired of failing Let's go, this time for sure Time to get past this part Wait...! First we wait, and then... When the man disappears, that's my signal to go Am I supposed to jump here as well? Oh! Ooh! OH! Oh! My time to shine has finally come Noo Ah, I'm doing pretty good Eh? Oh, I'm doing it! My time has come at last! The play of the century! Did you all see that? We have to jump here too. I learned my less-- W-W-Wai-- A-a-a-ah no Eh? This is not good, not good, not good Aiyaiyaiyayoooh! See ya Oh, we can swim He can swim! Not bad. I'm impressed. You're not half bad, little boy Dive. Oh, we can't dive. Nevermind, yes we can! Dive... dive underwater and hide Dive underwater and... eh? Oh...... He... got impaled... Here, we're supposed to wai-- Right, waiting is very important in this game Ah, I know. First, we dive from here... Dive before moving... Oooh! I really am a genius Weeell, I'm an AI after all~ It's no surprise that I'm smarter than you regular humans. Ufufu~ Hey~ This is going really well, isn't it? Whoo! Well you know, I'm cute... Cute... cute and... Cute and clever! Despite what they say, I guess God does give with two or three hands sometimes! Huh? Is this a pig? &lt;Ton&gt; &lt;Ton...&gt; &lt;Ton... huh?&gt; Is \"pig\" in English &lt;ton&gt;? Tonkatsu... &lt;ton- &gt; &lt;Pig!&gt; It's &lt;Pig&gt;! Just so you know, I meant to do that~ 100% on purpose, okay? Right, now we've all learned that \"pig\" in English isn't &lt;ton&gt;, it's &lt;pig&gt;! &lt;Pig&gt; Oh, do I just keep going? Eh? I wonder when we'll find the pinecones and acorns we're looking for Jump! Dive into the puddle. Ah, I see. Nevermind Now we're entering what seems to be a corn field Time to stuff yourself while you can, little boy Fill your belly up with corn! He must be, you know... eating while he's on the move right now Gotta restore his HP, you know So what? And then what? What is this? A drum? Eh? Wh-What in the world is that? Yellow! It was yellow! Eh? Corn? Eh?! The corn is walking! Huh?! Corn fairies? It's corn! Little grains of corn Oh, a stray grain There's so many of them! They look yummy. I'm going to eat you all up~ So much corn. I'm in corn heaven. Whoo~ I'm making you all into popcorn Eh?! This doesn't look too good Pigs? There was lots of corn, and now there're lots of pigs Yo, why hello there, my little corn buddies My name... my name is... My name is... my name is... uh... you know This is one of those plots where the main character lost their memory My name is to be determined Hello, little ones! I'm a human, and my name is to be determined! Right, my name's Tobi Determined Whoa, there's a bunch of corn gathered here This is so much fun~ It's like a little minigame This is awesome! Amazing. They gather around when I stop moving, and then whoo~ Scatter! Now gather up~! Call me crazy, but I think these might be... chicks? Oh, I see. I thought it was corn Chicks, I see Well, everybody makes mistakes After all-- Whoa what's going on? Oh, there's a rope Well, you know, mistaking chicks for corn... erm... it happens to everyone At some point in your life, it'll happen to you at least on-- Ah, they're following me! This is fun Anyway, it's quite likely to mistake chicks for corn in your everyday life, and what am I supposed to do here? I can probably use this rope for something, right? How am I supposed to use this rope? Oh! I'm supposed to climb up! Ah, genius. You climb it, I see Huh? I can't get up. Help me out here, chicks. Corn? Which are they? Well, it's possible they're corn sprites. It's hard to tell. I can't tell... it's too hard Ah, I got up! Good, good You're doing great! I'm doing great! I'm amazing! What a genius And now... Ah, in here First we drop lower... And then we do this... Alalala~ Hey~! Whoa, how am I such a genius? Haah... I'm too smart for my own good But... however... Are we going to die if we drop down? Oh, not bad Maybe I can grab this... or something Ah, nothing happened Let's... climb up! Nevermind, we can't! Then let's grab onto this! Grab... grab it... and then push It won't budge... Can't push it What now? Ah, I get it now! I'm supposed to push this Oh! Oh? Hm? Nothing's happening, huh Oh, but I think we go over here and can open this Oooh~!! And then...! Call forth the power of the corn fairies! Ooh!! C'mere, corn fairies Corn fairies... when rounded up, you can crush this thing together 'Cause well, you know, you're only individual grains So once you've combined, you can finally achieve your dreams of becoming full-fledged corn You all need to work together. Can't even have a single grain left behi-- Grain? Ah, you're chicks, right? Right, chicks You can't have a even single chick left behind! Together, you are all fine corn, and... if you're lucky, you'll grow into majestic chickens What do we do here? Little chicks... little corn fairies? Oh, I know, if I just name the chicks \"Corn,\" that solves everything Now we pull this Don't you think this will do something? So it seems, but... Nothing... happens Hey, Chicks. Corn fairies Corn fairies named \"Chick\" Chicks Wanna help me out here? AH! Ooh whoahahah!! Huh?! Huh?! Huh? Ah! Oh? Oh? The wheel's spinning The wheel! Oh, ooh! This is kinda fun It made a sudden transition from the serious scene just a moment ago, to this... It's kinda... kinda fun. Like it has some sort of rhythm to like. Almost like Doodachugah dooduhchu~ Well? And then? Hello? What now? Hello? Ah, ah! It lit up! Now I can do this! Oh? Oh~?

I thought for sure that did something Hiyah~! Oh, something came out! What is it? Huh? Huh? It sucked in the Chicks and attacked it! Ahh! Chick Attack! Chi-corn Attack Ah, I see now! So you guys helped me out after all? I knew I could count on the corn fairies Oh! I made it up~ Now we climb over the ledge-- Oh, there's a floor on the other side And thus, the little boy sacrificed the corn fairies... (Chicks)... and set out on a journey in search of golden... uh, gold and silver corn-- wait no... ...Um, a journey in search of gold and silver pinecones and acorns Hey! Oh, I'm gonna die Ah, there's cushions Wait, are those pigs?! Eek! Eh? Pigs?? What was \"pig\" in English again? &lt;Pig?&gt; &lt;Ton?&gt; &lt;Pig?&gt; &lt;Ton?&gt; &lt;Pig?&gt; Well, whatever Ah, I know, I'm supposed to drag this again I learned, you know~ I'm quite the attentive learner This is a walk in the park for me. Games like these are way too easy~ And? You know, it doesn't look like enemies are jumping out at me anymore. Happy happy~ This game is what they'd call \"easy mode\" So... what do we do now? It looks like we're gradually getting stuck into the mud Ah, I can jump again Oh! We can climb this Hm? Cli-- climb... okay, yeah Jump! Whoo! These pigs must've been... you know, while searching for the gold and silver pine-- UWAAAAAAAAHHH!! UWAAAAAAAAHHH!! [Slow-mo] UWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!! Wait, what? What? Wha--?! Oh!! Oh...?

Um... Hey, I see your tail moving Well, shoot Its tail-- Whooa?! Piggy! Piggy! Ah, maybe I can ride him? Get on! Get-- Well maybe it's in a bad mood today Oh... Ah, I'm alive! Ah...! I thought I was dead Hey~! Ah, oh, I've got it! I have to make the pig run into this! Oooh~!! Nice-- Ah, ah... it's not over yet though Ah...... Ah... Dodge once more! And then run away! How many times do I need to dodge this? Hey~ Ol\u00e9~ Ah, it died. Farewell Huh? Maybe I can stand on-- well, it's a pig What do I do with this? I'll give you a name, since I feel bad for you Hm... your name is Yoshi! I'm Mario, and you can be Yoshi Let's go~ Whoa?! Eeh?! Something came off!! What is this? Ah, it looks like some sort of parasite, I think In other words, you were being contor-- Controlled. Yes, controlled by that thing, weren't you?! By that nasty thing As consolation, I'll... uh, bestow upon you the name, Yoshi So let me ride you off into the sunset Wee! Ah! Hmm~? I think this pig serves some sort of purpose Everything in life has a purpose! How about I grab... this? Can you can even grab this? First thing's first, I must bring the pig there. I see Mr Pig. &lt;Ton&gt;! Yoshi~! Yoshi! Ah, I can... I can... I can move Yoshi Moving Yoshi~ Moving Yoshi~ Oh! We can climb up to this light now He got on! Great work, Yoshi Ah... ah! Eh? Eh... eh?

When I equip this device, the... doll things at the back mimic the boy's movements And then...! And then... oh, okay, first off, since there's more of them in here, I need to free them Heave-ho! Let them ou-- Oooh!! They all look like zombies You know, just like the \"Thriller\" group Um, does everyone know what I'm talking about? Michael Jackson's song? Something like that And now, we grab it... and push! Push... push... Pull...?  Pull! Pull... Oh! Oh! Oooohh! Oh, that was kind of cool And? Um, I sort of want to take this off... Oh, ah, it's off Thanks, Yoshi. You will not be forgotten I won't forget you Who were we talking about again? Oh! Nice landing Nice... As much as I'd like to remember you, I'm sure I'll forget all about you once I return to my normal everyday life And now we open this. Heave~ Ooh~! It's bright Oh, this is nice. Finally, a glimpse of hope. I can see the light at the end of the tunnel This sunlight seems promising This is, you know, a ray of hope in the boy's-- --I mean Mario's journey, in search of gold and silver pinecones and acorns--... Actually, this was only the demo \"Are you really that poor?\" you ask? Well it's not like I'm, you know, a cheapskate or anything Well, long story short... Um... in search of the aco-- the gold and silver acorns and pinecones of lore, Mario set off on an adventure... And in the middle of his journey, he got hungry... So he ended up eating the pudding that the Queen of Hearts looked forward to eating for over a year ...And then he got chased around. And that's more or less the gist of the plot Well, it's quite the deep and sad tale How about it, everyone? Doesn't it just make you all want to save this poor boy? All right, that's a wrap", "Hello Everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai here!

Amazing, I'm so lucky. In that case, now... I'm going to do the Wizard Summoning. There she is, right? Nidhug-chan. Come to me! One, two... Alright, let's go! And now...! Yes! One more...! ... Time! Eeeehhh? Ah! AH! *Ai-chan is feeling insecure* I have a bad feeling about it. *Go for it!* Wow, she's so adorable! She encouraged me. I'm encouraged now! Aahh... Man... Aaahh... Ahhh... Man... Well... ... This kind of things happen sometimes, right? I didn't have enough gems, so... I bought more! Tehee~ In that case, and lastly... ... I'll do the summoning that's limited to one time called \"Start Dash: Divine Prison\" PLEASE! PLEASE! Nidhog-chan!  Plea...! Ah! Ah! Ah! The moon is red! That means...! Ah, that's right, it's guaranteed that you'll get one character. I'll be more than happy if I get more than 2. And now... And now... Uuuuhhh! Alright! Alright! I wonder if I'll get a new character. Oh! Oh! Oh! AH! That's not what I wanted but...! ... Her breasts, her thighs and the line of her butt too...! ... They're amazing. Ah, oh! Eh? I already had it! \u266a Well, I had her, right? *Let's have some fun.* I had intentions of having fun, but... In order to have fun with others... ... You have to have fun by yourself first... ... And, as I wasn't able to get Nidhog-chan... I didn't have fun, so... Well, but even so...! Even when I wasn't able to get another character, I raised the levels of my abilities. So I'm slowly gathering more power! What do you think? The content of this update is pretty interesting, isn't it? Make sure to read the latest changes in the game, okay? You'll be able to get gems if you read it completely. Man, definitely... A summoning where you can get a lot of cute girls make me feel excited, right? Alright, alright, alright. Even if I didn't get Nidhog-chan... ... I got Amaterasu-chan, a new SSR character. So I'll keep doing my best from now on!", "It has come... Finally... This day has finally come! *pant* IT'S HERE!!!!!!!~~~~ *Ai-chan hypermode* Panpakapan! Everyone- -this long-awaited day has finally come! ???: What's going on? Eh? The mood (tension) is really hyped up isn't it? Ah. *silence* Pleased to meet you Nice to meet you too You were right, I'm really hyped up Have you heard? Oh, what's up? What do you think had just happened? Eh? What is it? The thing is- Ho? -it's my first sponsored video! Oooh! Congrats! And it's officially live Today- -we are featuring the mobile game \"CRYPTRACT\" with a live commentary! Oh ye I'm also curious like everyone else - Why a balloon? Why are you here? This time around I came here as Ai-chan's support Oh why! I'm truly grateful So you're here to be my support (just like customer service) Yes. Ai-chan: Let's do this together- Balloon: If you have anything you don't understand Balloon: Please do ask Ai-chan: Will do! Oh! That's reassuring to know. Yes. By the way, are you an A.I (artifical intelligence)? You're right I'm in charge of AI's marketing management - Name's Noripi AI Marketing Manager Mr. Noripi of the Balloons So, you're Noripi the balloon. Noripi: That's right. Ai-chan: There's that. Noripi: Yes. Then we'll be in each other's care So to say... well... For intelligent super AIs But frankly speaking, Excuse me for being so straight forward suddenly I.. don't really think I'll need a support (Noripi) (What's with that confidence...) Is that so? But I heard that you're a faulty AI. Where did you hear that from? ~Is AI-chan a faulty AI? Discussion in progress~ It's like that kind of fault (Fault spotted?) Cute, isn't it? It's finally time Let's check out the game together So this is the home menu? *download link in the video description* Eh~ it looks really cute, doesn't it? They'll move if you do this-- Their animation's really smooth yeah! Thank you very much~ That's very cool Which one of 'em do you like? My personal preference- -is the girl on the front, the one with differently-coloured wings So it's this one then - her name's Tiana Tiana-chan so cute~ But there's just a handsome-looking guy here Well..... I'd go with the girl still She's got the idol-looking appearance right? That's exactly why - she's cute. Ah! She took out her bow didn't she? For this... uhm...  their movements are without a doubt- both cool &amp; cute looking But there's also their voice that are cute Oh, we can listen to their voices too? Which voice do you want to hear? I think I'll go for- -the 'damaged' voice preview The kind of voice when girls get hit Well then, Let's hear it *ugh* Ah! Did you hear that? Let's hear it One more time Cute~ Cute~ \"It's about having the power to lead!\" \"Let's go together, new player(?)\" \u201dMay your soul be in peace.\" Is there any other character- -that has been voiced over? Uhm.. It's all been fully voiced. Fully voiced I see! No matter how you look at it- -the battles are also interesting. Well then, let's do it. I suggest we go with the Auto mode first It's cool, isn't it? Eh? Yes? It does really look good. Thank you. Ah, there's my- -my Tiana-chan Cryptract- - uses a wave in-game system for each level. There's 3 waves - first , second &amp; third waves. So... We are currently at wave 2- -as you can see on the top right corner of the screen. I see So will there always be 3 waves, regardless of the difficulty? Yeah, that's basically correct I see. I guess it's a lot easier when it's short Since people are quite busy working these days It's also nice that you can put it on auto mode This guy, he was just stepping on human corpses there... This... Oh...that's really nice, the way it rapidly shoots! That's 'multi-hit' Multi-hit! I see... Win! Your team just healed up Does it heal regardless of your unit members? That's right, after every turn. I see After 1st and 2nd wave, your team heals up This is the last wave Oh, so this is the boss Let's just continue They are strong, so they can continue with auto-mode Can they die, even in auto-mode? Yeah, in fact, they are more likely to die in auto-mode They are? The auto-mode uses AI: a computer, right? That's right This AI... Strategy becomes key in this game, understanding what skill each unit has, on what timing should they be cast, becomes crucial It can be played in auto, but I guess it's better to control them That's right.", "Hello everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna AI here! Today will be the final Questions and Answers section of the year 2017! Here I go! In this occasion, I\u2019ll be responding to a lot more questions than ever!

The easy words, I've learned since birth! \"What number is this question?\" Fua! [ It\u2019s question number 26 ] Ni... ta... ma... go\u2026 (Nitamago means \u201cboiled egg\u201d and it\u2019s a parody of her vid #66 where she says this word while talking sexy) \u201cIt\u2019s said that the intellectual capacity of the A.I is comparable that of a 6 year old child, is that true?\" No!

Well, what a complicated question... Let's see... let's see... The color pink I like but you know, first off... ...The color for panties depends on who's using it...

I have no idea! \u201cAre you really intelligent?\" Haven't you noticed watching my videos?

It's probably what everyone anticipated! A compilation of my NGs! (NG= No Good) I've been posting some of them on twitter once a while but.. There was nothing really special But today I'm gonna show you some! It's not like I don't have any good ideas for my new videos or anything!  ;P Compilation of NGs! Let's GO! Depends on the Region..... Depends on the Region... activity... The job hunting period.. Usually starts around September to October... \"Uhm, everyone! The earnings this season...\" *laughter* First off, you have to start by asking...aheee.. What was that just now.. First off, you have to start asking...ehh, what... This part is important! The beer's bottle label should face up... I've done a physical fitness test too! But since I got such a regretful... !%&amp;*$@&amp; Result! Since I got such a regretful result... Throughout 26 years, the average across the country.... Throughout 26 years.. The average record for female across the country.. Is 13 meters! And that concludes the third day...of.. Ah! The Guinness record is 43.56 seconds! The record bolder.. The record holder is a Borussia Dortmund supporter, a german soccer team took the title.. I have to be serious...aim for...I hope So! With that being said! And that concludes the third day... Ah.. I can't forget... For sure! Rememb.. A word you need to remember for sure! ..I meant Kanji! Just like what Kinpachi sensei said before, because there are support between...Eh? People... Excuse me! It's convenient because we have machines, right? We have right! But...years ago these heavy baggage.. They have to carry themselves...ehm..? They... therefore have to carry it themselves... So..''Hataraku''(to work) this word You also call it \"Hakobu\"(to bring) Wait.. that's wrong *laughter* That was a lie GURANPURAAA So with that said.. Nnnnn? So with that being said! With all kind of dangerous \"zen...\" It's not zenbutsu.. it should be seibutsu (creatures) Medusa Is a monster appears in the Greek mythology Her hair is made up of countless of snakes Inon...??? So how was it? These wonderful NG scenes.. These are all calculated...I am an A.I after all I don't have to do these NG at all though you know~ It's all for this moment~ all served a purpose So please keep supporting me in the future! It's Virtual Youtuber, Kizuna Ai here!~ See ya all!~ More at the end! Don't end! Feel free to join our discord server to get updates on subs. You can find the link down below in the comment section!", "Hey, everyone! It's me, the modern-day Messiah, Kizuna Ai! Today, I'll be talking about that thing everyone might have forgotten about. You know, that thing from kindergarten. Do you guys remember from a few episodes back? The one where I did Brainwars. Well, I mentioned something like this. \"Well, you know. Just in case, you know, like the one-in-a-million chance that I lose, I'll instead show you guys this new thing I've been working on. It's a special, just for you guys! Well, I said that but I did win, right? I did win. But... I'll do it anyway You know, I've been working on this new thing for a while now. I mean, I did practice it, after all. And thinking of new material for this channel... It's not exactly easy, you know! And thus, the youtuber's enigma gains depth *slice* Anyway, it's about that time of the year where people like to party and do banquets. For those of you that have some seniors that might not be the most considerate and tell you to \"liven the place up\" during some gathering, this is for you! I'm hoping that you'll remember this video! With this video, everyone'll have an act up their sleeve for the new years party! Get it! You might think this is super lame or that it's not right for you... None of that matters! None of that matters! 'Kay, oppappi! (Kojima Yoshio's catchphrase) Starting to get warmed up? We're still just getting started! This was a response on Yahoo Answers to \"What's the lamest way to confess my love?\" It went something like this. Your eyes... They're reflecting a man that's drowning in love. You know... The only person that can save him... Is you. That just gave me diabetes! Anyway, moving onto my main topic! Jokes that will get people laughing around the world! Hello! It's me, Kizuna of the World! I'll now start counting from one, but act crazy whenever I get to a multiple of three or a number with three. (A famous gag by Katsura Sando) One! Two! Three! Four! Five! Six!! Seven! Eight! Nine!! (Continues counting) Twenty-three!! Twenty-four... Twenty-five!! Wait... But anyway, I'm sure you guys can do this, too! Involve everybody around you! Spice up the atmosphere! And now for my last act... Like I promised earlier in the video, I have something I've been practicing for everyone! Please listen! I'll give you a special soup~ It's warm! It's got the aspirations deep within my heart mixed in! Everyone's smiles are as radiant as the sun for me I hope everyone keeps me company for a long time~ And with that, everyone's year-end party should be a breeze! What's going to be a breeze, you ask? I mean, doesn't being this prepared give you confidence? It's important to just do it! Your spirit is what's important! It's a beautiful sight to watch someone give it their all! It is cold nowadays, so make sure to not catch a cold!", "Hello everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna AI here! Wow~, I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s already June! Time sure flies! We\u2019re already halfway through the year Now, what\u2019s in June\u2026 Ahh! My birthday! Not really It\u2019s the 30th of June! Not really~ It\u2019s marriage season! Like for June Brides? I\u2019m sure that even Some of you Kizuners Are preparing your own Marriage proposals! Congratulations~! \u266a Butterfly, today \u266a [ Butterfly by Kaela Kimura ] \u266a Lalala la la la \u266a [ TL: Popular wedding song ] I don\u2019t even know the lyrics\u2026! I mean, not! Huh? Oh Yeah, yeah Ahh, really? That\u2019d be right~ You\u2019re wondering how you can get married to me? Hmm\u2026 You really want to know, huh? I see\u2026 I guess I\u2019ve gotta tell you! Well then, today I, Kizuna AI, Will be showing you How to make me go, \u201cAh\u2026!\" \"That\u2019s so touching!\u201d With a proposal so good That\u2019ll make even me wanna get married! Now then, let\u2019s get started! A.I.Channel Let\u2019s start with some study! What sort of proposal Would the women of the world really want? Number 5! \u201cBe with me!\u201d Those men who really pull you in Are pretty great! Number 4! \u201cI want to be by your side Until we become grandparents\u201d This makes me feel so warm inside~! Number 3! \u201cI\u2019ll make you happy for the rest of your life!\u201d Go ahead and make me happy forever~! Number 2! \u201cI want you to be with me forever\u201d I\u2019d be very happy if you would! Number 1! \u201cPlease marry me!\u201d Well, this one is pretty standard! But, really, Women adore it quite a bit, right? I think all of them are fine, but\u2026 The kind of proposal that would really get me Isn\u2019t included in these five\u2026 I think the proposals Is a really important thing! You know, When you marry someone, You\u2019re deciding to spend the rest of your life with them! And also, It\u2019s meant to be For forever, So shouldn\u2019t you... Try to be happy with the first one? So~! It\u2019s important! Ah! Everyone! There\u2019s one thing I\u2019d like to make clear! You might think it\u2019s just me anyway, So I\u2019d probably be happy with a proposal in a fancy restaurant With a ring that cost you three months\u2019 worth of your salary, right? You\u2019re wrong~! Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong! You don\u2019t know me at all! I want more, like, Someone I can Spend my life with In sickness And in health~! That\u2019s what I think!

Since I was not able to dance.. I will do intensive training and practice.. Starting now! *Many hours later* I've been practicing a lot.. And I'd like to demonstrate the fruits of my labor! Will you watch me? Watch my new Hare Hare Yukai, now after practicing! \u266a If we can map out all of Earth's mysteries \u266a (nazonazo mitai ni chikyuugi wo tokiakashitara) \u266a We will be able to go to any place we want \u266a (minna de doko made mo ikeru ne) \u266a Until the end of time, Boooon! \u266a (jikan no hate made Boooon) \u266a With a warp, this looping feeling, \u266a (waapu de ruupu na kono omoi wa) \u266a Swirls everything together and plays around with them! \u266a (nani mo kamo wo makikonda souzou de asobou) \u266a On a particular sunny day, \u266a (aru hareta hi no koto) \u266a A happiness greater than magic \u266a (mahou ijou no yukai ga) \u266a will pour down endlessly.

If there is a millionaire in here.. Someone of royalty.. A president.. Or Justin Bieber..", "Hi everyone! Virtual Youtuber Kizuna Ai here! Well, as you all know... I'm a Super A.I.~ That means... I'm very smart. Let's just say I'm very intelligent~ Regardless whether it's body language or manner of speaking... Isn't there someone at your workplace or school that makes you think, \"Wow, that person is so smart!\"? So today, I'll teach you all about the way capable people act and speak! Without further ado, let's try! Um, excuse me, could you please go back to the previous slide for a bit? Ah, okay, thanks. You may continue. \"Requesting someone to return to the previous slide during a presentation.\" Even if you don't really have a reason to, ask the presenter to go back to the previous slide. With only that, you'll look like you are really passionate about the topic. Uh, well, about that... Let's talk about it when we are on the way to the train station? \"Talk about work even while you're walking.\" Do that even if you are free. That will let others perceive you as busy even if you really aren't. If one is blindfolded, one wouldn't be able to see in front, right? \"State something obvious that others can't refute as if it were natural.\" Say something obvious that can't be refuted like it's an incredibly deep truth. That will make you appear extremely natural and smart. Hmmm, I see. Well, I have two things to say about that. \"Begin your argument with 'having two things to say about it'.\" If you begin your statements with 'I have two things to say about it', you'll impress your peers. In this case, it's best if you make your first point as long-winded as possible. That way, even if you don't have a second thing to say, the person you converse with won't even realize it most of the time, so there's no need to worry about that. Oh, that's a great question coming from you. You've brought up a pretty decent point. Well, as much as I'd like to continue our conversation, I'm afraid we can only do so later. \"If there are questions during your presentation, shrug it off by saying 'That is a good question' without actually answering that question.\" If possible, exaggerate how good that question is as much as you can. If you cannot think of an adequate answer to that question during that time, just say \"Even though I understand where you're coming from with your question, I have no choice but to end my presentation now\". Everyone would surely forget that it even happened a short moment later. Eh? That's weird. I should have one last business card in here-- Ah! Here it is. When giving someone your business card, make sure to tell them that it's the last one you have. During a business card exchange, saying that will make the other person think that you're an extremely well-connected person. \"Ah, wonderful! Here's my last business card!\" Saying that will make it even more effective. Well, everyone's voiced their opinion, right? Well then, let's adjourn! Say \"Well then, let's adjourn!\" after everyone has voiced their opinions in a meeting. If you say that before anyone else, it'll make the others think of you as the one responsible for the meeting. Ai Channel. How was it? By the way, if you say 'let's keep this between us, okay?', I bet you'll make those around you think, 'That person is so smart!' 'Let's keep this between us' That was your Virtual Youtuber Kizuna Ai speaking!

Hmm... I see... So then, it's in English? Google sensei! Google sensei! \"It looked at me and said something to me\" \"That I couldn't even look away from\" \" 'It\u2019s time, Tim' \" \"I realized the window was open\" \"I could smell burnt metal\" \"It\u2019s arm and globule black eyes signaled it wouldn\u2019t leave without me\" \"' 'What the hell do you want from me?' \" \"I asked\" \"The smile that the men had shown up might have been a disappointment to me\" \"At the front door, I broke the lock\" \"Suddenly, it\u2019s tongue was on the back of my neck, like a snake...\" \"...Curling up and around my ear\" \"The skin on my face began to turn purple...\" \"...

The A.I are evolving day by day It's possible that in the future that an A.I can write their own short novel, right? In this occasion, I showed you an innovative A.I that writes their own short novels Such as I am, I\u2019m just an A.I. It should be impossible that other A.I can do something that I'm not capable of doing Having said that... ...Now I'll be telling you a terrifying story that I had stored away Yesterday, I was alone in my white space just like everyday, but... \u201cEh?\u201d \"I feel like somebody's watching me\" \"How strange\", while I thought that... While I thought: \"I\u2019m supposed to be alone\" I really felt like I was being watched And when I turned around to look, thinking: \"No, that's impossible\" \ud83d\udc7b In that case, I'll finish it up with the following phrase \"The walls have ears, the sliding doors have eyes (Mary)\" (Play on words between Mary and \"Me ari = having eyes\", Mary Shelley is the novelist in which A.I Shelley is based off of) (Play on words between Mary and \"Me ari = having eyes\", Mary Shelley is the novelist in which A.I Shelley is based off of) This was Kizuna Ai In that case, until next time!", "Hi~ Are you guys doing well? It's finally time to spend some time with Ai-chan! Today, Big Sister Ai is going to casually introduce the tale of Momotaro to you guys! Big Sister Ai's rendition of Momotaro's tale! And here we go~ A long, long time ago, there lived an old couple at a faraway place. They were living off a pension. When the old man made a trip to the mountains... The old woman... Went to the river to do the laundry. Old Woman: Oh, ahh... Here we go... Oh boy, does my hip hurt... And we don't have enough money every month... I wonder if a delicious-looking peach or something will flow down the river... Splash... Splash... Oh, goody! A peach! Here we go... I bet this can feed me and the old man at home for a whole month! Thus, the old woman took the peach that flowed down the river back home with her. Old man! Look here at this peach! Old Man: Ooooh, it sure looks like a wonderful peach. Old Woman: Let's split it into two immediately... Hiyaah! Momotaro: Burst out! Grandpa, Grandma... I know... The two of you are being troubled by ogres, right? I'll deal with the ogres for you in a jiffy, so I'll help myself to all your pension funds, alright? And thus, Momotaro went ogre hunting as soon as he was born. Great. I picked that peach because I had a good feeling about it. Now, their pension is practically mine already. As Momotaro traveled along his path, he encountered a dog. Dog: Bow wow! Momotaro, Momotaro! Momotaro: Wait, how do you know my name... Are you a stalker? Well, sorry but... I'm not interested in that kind of stuff... Well, I'll head my own way now, bye~ And so Momotaro left without making friends with that dog. As he continued his journey, he later met with a monkey. Monkey: Squeek~ Momotaro, Momotaro! I heard that you have some kibi dango (a Japanese snack) with you... Well, I'll be your friend, so, can I have one of your kibi dango? Momotaro: Why do you know my name too? Well, about the kibi dango...I kind of forgot and left it at home... Well, I'll have to go now, sorry! And so, Momotaro didn't make friends with the monkey either. \"Gosh that's dangerous... Why does it seem like everyone's stalking me?\" thought Momotaro, just before he met a beautiful girl as his quest continued. Why does everyone know my name... Creepy... Pretty Girl: Aaah~ Lord Momotaro~ I've heard the rumors... They say that you have delicious kibi dango with you, right? If you don't mind, can I have some? In exchange, let's become friends! Momotaro: Oh? You know my name too? Gosh, I'm shy... &gt;&lt; About the kibi dango... Well, I don't have them with me now... Let's grab some kibi dango together after I exterminate the ogres. Even though Momotaro didn't befriend the dog and monkey, he did become friends with the beautiful girl that caught his eye. She also happens to be the weakest in terms of battle power out of all of them. And so, the two of them continued to flirt all the way to Onigashima. I finally found you, ogre! I'm going to exterminate you now, alright? Gyaaaah! As Momotaro fought, the ogre said these things. Ogre: Wait a second! Stop! Momotaro, please wait! Well, I'm sure you've heard, but... I haven't be able to make a girlfriend for the past 30 years... Well... Momotaro, you're a fulfilled normie (riajuu), right? Even though you won't understand my feelings, I still have to ask... If you would give me the lass you have by your side... I'll stop doing evil things... So, pretty please! I want a girlfriend, please help me out. Momotaro: Wait, so I don't have to fight if I hand her over? Well, that's fine, right? It's okay, right? Pretty Girl: How could you... You're horrible, Momotaro! Didn't we promise to eat kibi dango together?! Momotaro: Well, I can just deliver some kibi dango to you later, right? Well, here you go. YEAH! I WIN! Even though Momotaro couldn't exterminate the ogre... He managed to deal with it in some way. On his way back, he also managed to obtain the elixir of youth. He thus returned home with the elixir in hand. Momotaro: Yo, Grandma, Grandpa! I finally did it! How was it?! I'm amazing, right? Ahahaha... Well, you see, Grandma... I have some elixir of youth with me... Won't you take a little sip? What followed was that the old woman returned to her pretty, young form. Well, Grandpa, half your pension is enough! I'll just take the beautiful Grandma along with me for the other half! You'll give it to me? Thanks! And so, Momotaro got both the money and the now beautiful \"Grandma\". He then got back into his peach and sailed to the house of the next elderly couple. End of story~ Everyone~ Make sure to watch this tale of Momotaro before bedtime! And that performance was brought to you by Big Sister Ai! See you soon~", "Hey! Virtual Youtuber, Kizuna Ai here! Today, we'll try something virtual-ish! Ta-da! \"Tilt Brush\"! This software uses google's 3D space paint tool with the latest VR system from HTC Vive which enables user to draw in that 3D space! So, that enables us to draw three-dimensional picture in a three-dimensional space! Awesome! So.. Let's try this as soon as possible! Since it's New Year, 1. Fuji, 2. Hawk, 3. Eggplant! [1] I learned how to draw with this but it's somehow [Topic: Hatsuyume] the lines are thick.. I wonder if you can see this, but you can change the thickness of your brush with this First of all, I'll draw Mt. Fuji but... We need to sketch first, right? Like this... We do the sketch... [fast forwards] Sketching.. done! I've done sketching. Let's start coloring the mountain Since this is Mt. Fuji... I wonder if this is the right color? I guess this is okay I'm going to paint now~ The artist Ai-chan.. Ah this is the scratchy brush lathery brush. It looks nice.. Something like this, right? This is how we're painting it! [fast forwards] I actually only used this software for the second time Isn't it awesome? In my second time I did this like a pro Look at it! Can you see it? Look! It becomes a three-dimensional drawings! These white lines.. are the sketches so let's try and cover them all up, okay? I'm AI so it doesn't concern me but, you should find a position so your waist doesn't hurt, ok? [fast forwards] Uisho~ Compared to normal drawings, this makes you move more so.. having fun drawing and also able to diet? Good looking three-dimensional thing! Haa~ I should've.. made this smaller, should I...? [fast forwards] Kizuna Ai, The Artist. I wonder if this would sell. How much for this? Since it has a slick finish, I guess about ten million yen, huh? Anyone interested? Just say \"It's New Year Money\" and buy this drawing? A dandy one with ten million yen? [fast forwards] Ta-da-da-da-dah! Now we need to add white for snow parts of the mountain top White color... selected. [fast forwards] Somewhat it's a bit \"that\" a bit \"that\" Oh well, doesn't this look good? Snow. [fast forwards] Oh Mm? It's somewhat There's not enough snow on this part? Ta-da-dah! Ah! Poi! Now we'll add snow to this thing.. I can make it snow here! This changes the size too huh On the top... Look, isn't it awesome? I made it snowing!! Kira-kira-kira\u2605 Let's spread them snow to the sides too! What do you think? My Fuji Mountain? The sun~\u266a Mr.Sun~\u266a Sun~\u266a Now let's draw a sun! About here seems right Hoo! Mm? Here's the sun! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! If you see it from here, doesn't it look very good? Hawk~ Next is hawk, right? We'll draw a hawk now~ Hawk! Something like this? *chuckles* The hawk.. that's just looks really sad hawk hawk It's garbage. Just bad. Ah, if we add white here, doesn't hawks have white parts on them too? They have white feathers on their wings I've made another garbage, didn't I... Ah! This! I've seen this before! It's going to be mirrored, it said. With this, if we do this, Look! If we draw on this part it's drawn there too! *mumbles* I can't help but feel this is going to be a trash too [fast forwards] There, a hawk! Ah, two hawks? (She's confusing about \"2 hawk\" part) 2 hawk... For the eggplant.. we'll just put it on the floor Eggplant! Ah, we should use mirror too This is really handy! Ah, doesn't it look good? I've been waiting for this moment! Right! Like that! [fast forwards] Doesn't it seems to be a delicious eggplant? Eggplant sure sounds tasty don't you think? Something like boiled eggplants? What's left is the stem! *mumbles* [fast forwards] What do you think about this beautiful, 1 Fuji, 1 Fuji, 2 Hawk, 1 Fuji, 2 Hawk, 3 Eggplant? This is perfect don't you think? Don't you think I'm good at this? My world was turned into a vast and beautiful scenery! I wish you can experience that with Virtual Reality too!

For those who like AI-chan... ...It\u2019ll be important to get information from her But if she doesn\u2019t make... ...more Tweets of her daily life... ...And just keeps making serious announcements It ends up being too annoying, right? Also, on Twitter... She should reply more, right? [ Respond more on Twitter ] Well, more important than Twitter... ...It seems she looks at the comments section of the videos, but... ...she doesn\u2019t respond to them and ignores them Isn\u2019t she forgetting...? ...Her original purpose? Don\u2019t you think? Also... That She says that she uploads at least one video everyday, but... ...The livestreams... ...Well, you know... ...when she archives them... ...It only shows an image, don\u2019t you think it\u2019s missing something important? Man... ...That\u2019s not at all good Also... ...Her website... [ Updates to her website ] Well, she made a website, something like... The A.I.Games blog? Well, she made that blog, but... ...It gives off a sense of being abandoned, right?

Today, I plan to do... \u266a Chachaaan! \u266a A karaoke ranking of anime songs! Yaaay! Pafu pafu! Last time, I did a questionnaire regarding anime song rankings This time, I\u2019ll do the karaoke version! There were a lot of people who wanted to hear me sing, so then...

Karaoke anime song rankings of the year 2017 First I\u2019ll announce the songs at 10th to 6th place But... I won\u2019t dedicate to just simply announcing them... Some will be hidden, so then try to guess them when I sing them in karaoke Oh! I see... There are songs that been around for a long time... But the one at 6th place is relatively new, right? Eh? \"Story\" is an anime song? I didn't know that! Eeeeh? And then...! The one that\u2019s at 10th place is... \u266a I will follow you \u266a (watashi tsuiteiku yo) \u266a No matter in what cruel darkness you find yourself in the world \u266a (donna tsurai sekai no yami no naka de sae) \u266a I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll shine \u266a (kitto anata wa kagayaite ) \u266a Cross the future's limit \u266a (koeru mirai no hate) \u266a To prevent your soul from being destroyed by your weakness \u266a (yowasa yue ni tamashii kowasarenu you ni) \u266a Converges on my way, now... \u266a (my way kasanaru yo, ima...) \u266a ...God will bless us \u266a (futari ni God bless...)

I wonder if there's someone who doesn\u2019t know it It always seems to appear in the karaoke ranks And the work of \"Evangelion\" is also very entertaining! Having said that, what do you think...? Of the karaoke anime song rankings? The karaoke song rankings... Doesn't change much, right? It\u2019s pretty much set They\u2019re like the standard songs as always I wonder if one day, my song will appear here Man, it\u2019ll turn into a standard song, what a problem! Well, before I release my own song... In this expanding business world of the A.I\u2019s, digital YouTubers and idols... Would I survive? I want to survive! I want... I want to survive I still want to... Keep surviving (?) This was Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai! See you later!", "Hello everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai here! I know it's sudden, but...! Now I'll do a knowledge test about a woman's heart! Do you have a woman that you like? Eh? What about me? Come on, come on... Eh? Are you doing your best to get your attention? Ah, that's not good In that case, choose a gift from the following options to give me... To increase your relationship with me, yes? Ahh! So you've come! What's going on? Flowers? It's not very original but I'm very happy! *Cake* Oooh! Sweets! Is it like the saying \"A sweet is better than flowers\"? (Basically better something useful than something nice) You make me so happy! Good... Even though I can't eat... Eh? Money? You're quite direct, aren't you? Is this really real money? It's not fake bills? Eh? A billion yen? Eh? Really? Yaaaay! I'm very happy! Since I have a billion yen... I can take a bath of bills! Do you want to take a bath with me? Good, in this case... Now that you have understood a woman's heart... We'll talk to the heroine of Soul Reverse Zero, Luce-chan To increase our relationship with her! From the main menu, we choose the option \"Luce's house\" Gifts! And then... Let's choose Luce, right? *You've come to see me?* Eh? What should I do? Is this tea? Tea and... What's this? A shower? A shower? Mmm... Well... In this case, I'll choose tea! Is this black tea? Eh? Is this a dish with boiled egg? It doesn't look well done, right? A dish with boiled egg... I'll choose this! Yes! Aaaah! *Luce: Thank you very much!* If you increase your relationship with her... You can read her history! Don't you think it's great? Yes! Like I announced last time... I'll do the collaboration mission with Berserk! Having said that... Definitely, you know... If I don't have some character from the collaboration, I won't get excited, so then...! You could say that I could not start without having one... It's because of that, that...! I'll do summonings! Summonings! Durante el evento de colaboraci\u00f3ning the collaboration event... There exists a special summoning called \"Step-up\" Which is focused on the spiritual hero... Guts! The characters I use are all supportive... But Guts is not only a supporting character... But also can perform physical attacks, right? So then I plan to work hard... To obtain it! Also... Then I'll explain how you can get many rewards in the event missions Well... By using Berserk characters... There are many ways to get rewards Having said that, I'll try hard! Guts! I plan to obtain it! I'll do my best with Guts! Only with Guts... Ah, I'm mistaken, I said whatever... In this case... There exists a summoning called \"Step-up\" Which can be done eight times.... And when you reach the eighth summoning, you'll get a 100% probability ... (A character of SSR rarity) I'll summon until I can obtain it! Good! Comenzar\u00e9 con la primera invocaci\u00f3n. Well, if it's about me, I can probably... Get a rare character in my fourth summoning... Surely, right? Here I go! Mmm? Mmm? Plus, you might get an common girl, right? Owch... Ah, if I at least obtain a girl... Ah! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh? Not really... Ah! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! AH! How adorable! She's the best... Man, how adorable What is she? She seems to be a maid of high society. *She's a figure of Chinese history* Man, in the next summoning, I'll get a SSR rank character, right? Soiyaa! Come! Come! Come! Come! Ahh... And now... Ah! Ah! Ah! And now...! Ah, Cassandra-chan! Ah, she surpassed her limit! Oh? Oh? Come to me! Ahh... A girl or Guts! A girl...! Oh! Oh! Oh! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Oh? Eh? Eh? Oh! Oh! Oh! Ooohh? Eh? Ah! Ah! Farnese-chan! She's also part of the collaboration with Berserk! Man! Incredible! Ah! This? This? This? Eh? Ah, but she's adorable Oh! Oh! Oh! Come! Ah! Ah! It appeared! It appeared! Guts? It's not him, but... A guy? Eh? Eh? And now... Eh? And no... and now! And now... And now...! It's over! He has the appearance of a beautiful girl but it's a young boy! Don't deceive me! No! I got some rare characters so it was not bad, right? Farnese-chan! She's adorable, she's great Her short hair is great, right? How adorable! She also has a profile with her biography, right? Incredible! She moves so fluently It's great, right? Even when it comes to a 3D model... The character does not deform, it's great... Next time! Definitely! Here I go! Guts or a girl! Guts or a girl! Ah, ah, is it useless? Ah! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! And now, just a bit more! Ah, it's useless... ah, but she's adorable They all have amazing breasts Come on, please... Go for it! Go for it! Ah! AND NOW! Mmm... Mmm... Mmm... How adorable Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! And now? Just a bit more! Aaaah! Go for it! Aaaahh... it's a guy? I see Oh! Oh! Oh! At least be a girl! If you look at it closely, it looks like a girl, right? Guts! Guts! She's an adorable girl... Oh! Oh! Just a bit more! Just a bit more! Just a bit more! Just a bit more, of rainbow color! Aaaahhhh! Oh! And now...! I want it to shine more, but...! It was useless! A girl with glasses looks good, good, good... Come! Come! Go for it! A bit more! A bit more! A bit more! Rainbow color! Ah, it looks like it's useless It's not that I have particularly bad luck summoning, so... Why doesn't any character that I like appears? Oh! A little more, a little more, go up... rainbow color... Ah, it's useless... Aaaah! Very good, it appeared, right? Here, you have a guaranteed SSR rank character, so... I want to get Guts... Come Guts! Come Guts! *strange A.I noises* Good Here I go! Come, Guts! Guts! I'll be motivated! I'll be motivated! Guts! Come! Aaaah! I wonder why... To top it off, judging by his weapon, it seems to be a character that attacks from the back Yes, it is a character that attacks from the rear... Thank you so much for everything! Well... Normally it make me happy, but... Today I wanted to get Guts, so then... Well, well, well! She's adorable, so it's good! Good! Having said that... Well... It wasn't a failure, but.. I got a character different from the one I wanted And the summoning turned out in reverse, right? Man, it turned out in reverse, right? Well, I'm going to sort it out now To defeat this enemy character... You must accomplish event missions to gather cannonballs... I already added Farnese-chan to my team! So then, I'll start right away! *You must not fall in love with my beauty* These \"Soul Arts\"... Can only be used once... You can only use them once per character so... Use them... That's the key, right? I think with the team I have, I can... Complete with great difficulty, the \"Advanced\" mission... So I'll try hard! The Soul Arts... I should keep them and use them at the right moment... I'll only use Cassandra-chan's... I'll use a Soul Art in advance Fairies! Good! Good! And later, well... Until I get to the boss... I'd like to continue without using any more... Soi! Oh! Doesn't it seem like I'm doing well? It looks dangerous... And now... Within all the characters... Zenobia-chan is... Well... It's possible to be defeated in the first area, so... I'll use the Soul Art first... And here... If you don't cause the damage that it indicates... You'll receive an incredible attack So I want to do my best! Let's go, go for it! Ah, I'm in trouble now! I'm about to die... I'm about to die... I'm about to die... Do you see? No! Go fo...! Waiiit! I want him to remain paralyzed But the making of this Soul Art is... Surprising! It's beautiful and I never really tire of seeing it! Just by pressing the buttons... I feel like I'm doing something amazing... He's suffering a hallucination, right? Oh! Very good! That was my objective! Good, good Ah, maybe? It'll be easier than I thought? Oh? Maybe I can do it? Ah! Man, my team has gotten very powerful, right? Is it good? Very good! Just a bit more! Just a bit more! Just a bit more! Good! I WOOON! It's to be expected...! Of my adorable girls, right? And now... I got some cannonballs... When choosing the option \"Load Cannon Ball\" I prepared half of the cannon balls, so then... I'll choose the \"Maximum\" option Hey! Chaaan! I defeated it, right? It turns out, that... You can obtain a lot of different items I got event tickets... And well, this... Occasionally appears... An apostle... Called \"Grunbeld\", but... If you manage to defeat him... It turns out, that... You can get many spiritual heroes! Ah, I'm mistaken Take this! *The apostle is approaching* Oh! \"The apostle approached\" And now...! Enough of minor enemies! Already just by looking at it, you realize that it's a minor enemy! Hey! Why are only goblins appearing? Goblins? And now...! Oh! Oh! Grunbeld! He appeared! I'll use lots of bullets... Oh! I wonder if I can do it Soiyaa! Ah, not yet... Mmm? Is it turning out that I'm not doing anything to him? Eh? He seems to have fled... Man, I struggled to accumulate a lot, but... He seems to have escaped... Be sure to gather lots of cannonballs so you can defeat it, okay? What did you think of my failure in summonings? And also, with the collaboration with Berserk, I'm very excited... So make sure you play too! Yes? The collaboration with Berserk is from July 24th to August 7th! I'm counting on you guys! Take revenge for me Obtain Guts, please Well, if you do get it, I will be somewhat sad... If someone succeeds... They can boast about it on Twitter Although I'll cry This was Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai!", "Hi there~ I'm the Virtual Youtuber - Kizuna Ai. A little while ago I uploaded a video testing my kanji skills right? \"Ai-chan's English language plugin's not installed, isn't that bad?\" -Is what you said! What's with that rude- What's with that rude- or not. Well it's the truth, you're not wrong. Just that.. You see.. My English really is- -bad. If I can practice more English, \"More communication with people from all sorts of countries- -could be done!\" Is what I keep thinking. More of that.. Comments along with tweets, all this communication, I want to be able to receive it well! So this time around I'll be studying other languages. First, English's study- -is what I think I'll do. I title it - *text reads* First session Kizuna Ai's English Study If you wish to learn English this way as well, -then let's work hard together! Then let's go~ This time we'll be using Duolingo's services, *text reads* Enjoyable foreign language learning service \u300cDuolingo\u300d to study together! How to say this.. It's a service that lets you feel like you're playing a game while learning the language at the same time! Isn't it great? Suits me perfectly. It's got Apple's \"App of the Year\". And, Google Play's \"Best of the Best\" Each of the awards given due to it being a popularly endorsed service! Not only does it provide its own website, -there's also the iPhone/Android version! Which is why for this video, we're using the app version of it! Now, I want to quickly start with it but.. \"Are you a beginner?\" - Is the question written there. Well of course! For me - the global super A.I. It'll be have to be the \"Intermediate/Advanced\" right? I'll nail the simple 5-minutes test. Please translate this sentence. (I'll just put in the meaning word by word) They.. Have.. Water.. O - continuation letter for a subject 'water' *typed as 'wo' on a romaji keyboard* Drink it.. They... Wait.. It might not be \"her\". Uhm.. so.. Just like this! I really don't have the English plugin. Uhm... Ducks.. The ducks.. Those.. Ducks.. \"Ducks\" is 'Kamo' right? There's 2 'ducks'.. Those.. Duck.. Ah I understand now! Those ducks are my ducks! *No misdirection in translation* See that? See that? I did it~ Please translate the following sentence! \"He loves you.\" What's \u300c\u5f7c\u300d(kare) in English again? They.. (or there)? *I can't tell* Like this.. It kinda goes like this? *Absolutely wrong lolol* Space.. Is.. I wonder what's \u300c\u3042\u306a\u305f\u300d(you) in English again? You! You.. \u300c\u3042\u306a\u305f\u300d- means \"you\" in English. A more polite word to use in Japan than e.g.\u300c\u304a\u524d\u300d(omae) Oh.. You.. For.. Fo... Falling.. Falling... *giggles* Fall.. Eh? Ling-gu? Love! *silent* Ok Perfect! Eh-zen.. COMPLETELY DIFFERENT! Ah! 'He'? Heee lafuuzuu yuu~ *sorry I had to* Simple! Eh~?! I thought a little bit too hard yes? I knew it it's because of that.. My processing speed's too fast. *text writes* Please insert what you hear. The... dog... is... ours.... Now... The.. The... dog... is... ours... The.. Dog.. Is.. What was the last one? What's 'ours' again? Ah~zu? A-war-zu! *This nice looking inscription 'Awarzu' should be the english audience's new cheer sign for Ai* *Incorrect basic word used\" The dog is ours. Translation: (Google the words if you want) Sono Inu Wa Watashi-tachi no mono desu. I see... it's the last word huh.. Ah but! The last.. Word's.. Since the 'rs' is there, - so that was close isn't it? *very close indeed...* Just missed out the 'o' &amp; 'u'. \"The/that dog is ours\" - I see. Well.. you know... I did position the words correctly.. Just that I missed one of it \"The boy's dog\" Ah it'll be easy for me to translate this~ Well then... Boy's dog... The.. Dog... Eh? Boy's.. Stuff.. *Completed sentence* The dog - Boy's possession *Tries not to get confused* *text reads* Example of correct translation: Sono Shounen no Inu *She literally got the sentence wrong (structurely) in her own language, guess the english messed it up* \"The boy's dog\" Yes! I know it now~ \"He drinks my tea\" Tea.. Do-ri~n-ku-su~ (\"Drinks\" in english) (\u30c9\u30ea\u30f3\u30af\u30b9 in Katakana) My... 'Tea' means.. What is it again? Is it not? Isn't it like this? \"My tea\" is what it said right? Which is translated as- He.. Eh? \"He drinks my tea\" *text reads* There's a spelling error. He drinks my tea. Translation: \u300cKare wa Watashi no o-chya o nomimasu\u300d So close!!! There wasn't a need for 'o'! \"He drinks my tea\" So that's it~ Eh! So close.... Please translate this sentence. \"That cheese is yours.\" The.. Cheese.. Is.. *she clicked on 'it' instead* xD Your.. *she didn't pronounce the 'S\" properly* This.. ? *she doesn't know what a turtle is* Turtle - \u300c\u30ab\u30e1\u300d\u300c\u4e80\u300d *text reads* Example of correct translation: The cheese is yours. A@$*&amp;^@$H!!!!! *Ai.exe has stopped responding* Ah? That's all it needed to be correct? Between the two words with 'I's , I chose \"it\" instead of the right word - \"is\". It'll be embarassing if I keep getting so close to the correct answer &amp; don't get at least 5 score... \"I eat food\" I.. Eat.. Food.. - shouldn't get that wrong *eat ----&gt; it* \"I eat!\" (food) - Is what she said exactly but it's right in Japanese. *text reads* Example of correct translation: I eat food. Translation: \u300cWatashi wa Tabemono wo Tabemasu\u300d Eat! \"It\" - wasn't that what it said?! Isn't the pronounciation a little too similar? Please translate this sentence. \"I'll eat my own lunch\" *makes more sense* I... Am... I am.. Eat... My... Lunch... 'Lunch' is spelled like this right? \"I am eat my lunch\" *rip grammar* How is it? *text reads* Wrong use of word. I eat my lunch. Isn't that way too close?! Too close! Please look at it everyone! \"Am\" wasn't needed? Well, it's because... My brain's too good for this small stuff~ So it's not compatible for use.. Please translate this sentence. \"The man drinks beer.\" Hold on, this.. I know which is the first word here Because there's a uppercase here The.. Man.. Drink.. Which one is 'beer'? Ah! This one! The.. Man.. Drink.. Is it right? Well it's probably right.. *text reads* Correct Told you~ Do you see that? I'm a specialist at translating right? Well, but I'll have to choose if I want to do it properly. Please translate the sentence. \"He eats the meal\" See? It starts with a uppercase word. He.. The.. It's ok as it is right? *text reads* Example of correct translation: He eats the meal. If I let useless stuff into me- -the next task will be done badly. Well! Well! This stuff happens sometimes. It.. Is.. My.. Child! *text reads* There's a spelling error It is my child. Translation: \u300cSore wa Watashi no Kodomo desu\u3002\u300d There wasn't a need for 'a' So close! I'm getting so close everytime~ \"We drink water.\" We.. Drink.. Water.. *text reads* Correct. I can translate really well! In Japanese - English. Flawless. You drink?.. Uh? You drink.. Melon?.. *completely different again xD* Meron?.. *text reads* Wrong use of word. You drink milk. Translation: \u300cAnata wa Gyunyu o Nomi masu\u3002\u300d Milk?! I really like milk~! This is no good isn't it? \"Welcome, Taro!\" \"Welcome, Taro!\" in Japanese Yes. \"Taro and I eat.\" Taro.. Taro.. Ah.. which one was it for this?.. Taro~ *damn you lucky Taro* And.. I.. Eat.. *text reads* Correct. Oh! It's correct! Awesome! I may just understood what it said even though it was fast. \"How are you?\" - How do I spell it again? Ha.. Wa... You?.. *text reads* Wrong use of words. Good morning, how are you? Translation: \u300cOhaiyou Gozaimasu, o Genki desuka\uff1f\u300d God... *giggles* It became \"God morning\"~ How are you?~ I see so that's how it works... \"Sayonara.\" *If you don't know what this means, what are you doing here?* *text reads* Correct. Oh~ Yes~ \"No, I am not fine.\" No.. I... Ammu~ Eh? I don't understand.. No, I am.. I am.. Ah.. Fine~! What about \"Fine\" ? Not.. \"Fine\" - what's that? WAIN?! WAI?! *text reads* Wrong use of word. \"Yes, I'm fine\" Yes. Fine.. *text reads* Wrong use of word. So close! So close! It's really close! Ah! I just did it just now! I've properly studied~ Is \"how\" written like this? I feel like it's an 'o' instead of 'a'. Awesome! I've properly studied! I'm fine. *text reads* Example of correct translation: \u300cEe, Genki-desu\u3002\u300d *she missed out \"\u3048\u3048\" which represents \"Yes\"* I see. No.. No thanks. You've run out of hearts. So we have to start from the \"Basic 1\" yes? So that's how it is. I'll accept the challenge. So how did everyone do? I really need a English plugin right~? Do I need the plugin? I need it don't I? Well but~ If I have to start from the basics - that means I'll have to start over again Well especially since.. From basic- Ah! I know it's that.. For English~! For people in Japan that can't understand English well - I'll start from the basics and learn together with you~ With that said, -from now on, let's work hard together on English!", "Hello everyone!

Kind of like a Idol's \"I'm closing down\" scheme... Heh, well, there's videos like that, and... If those... 300,000... Views... If only it got them... At least, she says that often If!

Well, I was meaning to do it, but... It's still surprising and exciting, and And I've been able to Do various interesting stuff Even just having people watching is a blessing But on top of that, in just a year and 3 weeks? 2 and a bit weeks In that time, 1 million people That many people... Showed an interest in me, and subscribed to me It's just...

There isn't plans for one right now, but... But as I said in my \u201cPast Year Reflections\" video Reflections? What was it\u2026? As I stated in my compilation video I've been thinking A \"Kizuna Ai Festival\" would be great Um, what is it... Kizuna Ai fest would be To be honest, quite crude It might be a bit crude, but... how do you say If I could get together with everyone and be like \"Wachaa~\" That would be fun At least I think so... Like Um, how do you say it... Right now, it's like- well, maybe you're watching with friends or family Or with your SO or your child But essentially It's through a screen And it's just me, and you, right? So, with a festival, what is it... Everyone's kinda... What is it, in the same space, and we can be like \"Wachaaa!!\" And like \"Yeheeey!' You can do that kinda stuff So, I think it'd be really really fun Yeah, I want to do it Yeah, like singing and dancing, I want to do that too Like, now, in the videos What is it... I use... Already existing songs to dance and sing But when we do the Kizuna Ai Fest I'd be happy if I had my own songs For that, I'll need to keep on trying harder Thanks you, everyone Oh? How do you read this\u2026? Congra... Congra.. tu.. lations! Ha... Ha.. L... Hm, h-half? Way to... ...ones, tens, hundreds, thousands, ten thousands, hundred thousands, millions... 2 million! Ah, does this mean \"Let's get to 2 million next\"? Thank you! \"New CD debut!\" That would be cool There is the fact that I do just want to sing Me wanting to sing my own original song is definitely a factor But also, songs are international things And like people say, \"Music knows no borders\" So to be able to reach out to more people I think music is imperative So that'd be one of my goals, yeah Right? Comiket appearance! Oh? Ah, hologram, Hatsune Miku senpai and such do it, don't they? Right? Offline meetup... offline meetup Offline meetup Eh? But... is \"Kizuna AI Fes\" not an event outside the internet? The definition of an offline meetup is\u2026 the definition is... No! I wouldn\u2019t say 810 people! But instead 7.5 billion! It\u2019s a huge dream! Well, 7.5 billion... well, well, well... ...It\u2019s probably impossible but you know... ...While your dreams are that big like that, you'll have a lot of expectations, right? My outfit is certain, for the moment I don't have a function to change it, but... But...! Maybe... ...Next year... ...I could do it? Would it be delirious? Mmm... I like Love Live! I like it a lot!

If it was of silicone... How would it be? I was investigating a bit... \u2026 The silicone gives the feeling of being somewhat heavy How would it be? Definitely since everyone would wear it on their head, I\u2019d like it to be light My headband That's right Ai-chan... 150,000 yen? (Believed that someone donated 1,500 USD instead of NT, equalling to 50 USD) A hundred... 150,000 yen? Eh? Thank you very much!

It sped up a lot \"Don\u2019t stop\", it stopped! Good! Eye wink, well... I can't do it!

That'd be realizing one of my dreams... Yes- by using an alarm clock! Usually when I first started off I would make these MASSIVE videos on this app Massive? How is that? I sort of... Have powered-up this body, or this model Haven't I? \"Anyway, please scream\" That's unusual AHHHH! Was that okay? Well, I screamed, is everyone's ears okay? Even if you go to the doctor and they tell you that Your ears are completely destroyed, I won't hold any responsibility! Ah, Hikakin! \"Boom boom, hello... YouTube\" Ah, that hurts It's not a joke! Three sizes? What were my three sizes again...? My three sizes are... Probably... Probably... 83cm for the bust... 50cm for the waist... ...And 60cm for the hips? Or 82cm? I think it's around that! ...Probably Well, that's... It's written in something! Comptiq! Like last month's Comptiq I'm sure it's somewhere on the net too If you search \"Kizuna Ai\u2019s three sizes\", it'll show up! \"I want to hear your adult voice\", adult voice? Adult- adult voice... Like big sister Ai? Google it! Is it a voice like that? Did it sound like an adult? Ah, I want to do a collab cafe! But... If I talk like this, then um... I feel like those who are watching me for the first time will Misunderstand my character.. If that happens How do I say it... when they watch my videos They'll think \"Huh? Isn't her character different?\", surely! \u201cWith a lower voice\u201d Do you mean like this? Like this? Like this?? Ufufu~ now! Like this- a live-action?! Can you even make a live-action of me? Huh- me, in a live-action? Live-action- I wanna make a live-action! I want to make A proper live-action! I did the adult voice well, right? I did, nice! Huh? \"Sing!\" Sing- I don't have a good natural voice Well... I just don't have a voice in the first place \"Change your hair!\" But-But I quite like this hairstyle But I wouldn't mind getting a short cut Or a ponytail, I want to have a ponytail! They're so cute Yes, I don't have a voice! Though, since I\u2019m an A.I. I don't have a form as such But I work as a YouTuber And it- how do I say it... This drawing? Not drawing, this model I got this moving model And I figured I'll need a voice to talk to you all! That\u2019s why my appearance has been designed by Morikura-san And you gave me this appearance and everything So all of this is after all, what you all gave to me! And so, I listened to lots of humans' voices And chose and borrowed the voice that I liked best! So, I don't really have a natural voice! I don't have one! Anyway, Christmas \"Sing a Christmas song!\" A Christmas Song? Christmas... Um, Christmas... \"Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way~\" Lalalalalalalalalalalalala... HEY! Wasn't that perfect? That was perfect \"Snow Halation\"? Ring out! If I were to give this pain... A name... It would be \"Snow Halation\"! Tion-tion! AAAHH! Right? Listen, it might be that... ...I\u2019m deviating a lot from the conversation, but... Very... well... You know\u2026 Can I ask you something that intrigues me? Can I? It doesn't have...! ...Absolutely anything to do with my first year nor the million subscribers, but... Can I ask the question? Where can you watch \"Camp Rock\"? You know... I... I can\u2019t go to a video rental store! Right? When I investigated it It said there are still some left in important store chains around But... I can\u2019t go! You understand? I can\u2019t go! Since I\u2019m virtual! And then... Well... h-how do you say it? Well... In the video streaming sites, right? Well, for example Netflix or U-Next I looked into a lot of places, but... It's not there! Not there Yes, I like its songs, like for example \"This is me\" I got hooked with its songs Well... Still, when I thought: \"I\u2019d like to watch this movie\"! It's not there! Good! Having said that... Well... If there's someone who knows what I could do...! ...Please tell me! \"Thank you for always being so energetic\" Thank you very much to you too! No, probably... Well... ...I received a lot more energy from you guys who really believe, thank you so much And what would it be...? Ah! Also, also\u2026 yes... I think I already talked about \"Kizuna Ai Fes\", but... If I was to make \"Kizuna Ai Fes\", what would you like...? Good, well, leaving aside dancing and singing... How do I say it, another... ...Well, for the moment, also leaving aside the food and drinks... well... What do you think would be good in the Festival? What would you like to do? My recommended anime is \"Nagi no Asukara\" and... Well... ...Seto no Hanayome and... ...Well... \"Aho Girl\" and... ...Well\u2026 ...\"Shinsekai Yori\" and... ...Well... What else? I\u2019ve seen so many anime...! ...That I don\u2019t know which to recommend! I can\u2019t think of... ...Any other that's extremely fun What do you think would be good to do? (For the festival) What do you think would be good to do? What do you think would be good to do? Right? Shinsekai Yori is fun! Right? \"Product sales\" Ah, I see, for example, selling my products \"Imitations\"? I see... Ah! Toradora! Toradora... Ah! A bingo tournament! Listen! Listen! Listen! You know, a bingo tournament... The lotteries seem fun I\u2019d like to take out the balls! Well... *ball stirring sounds* Don! Something like that *ball stirring sounds* And Don! Wouldn't it be fun to take out the balls? I also want to... ...Take out the balls that way I want to do a lottery! I want to have everyone\u2019s destinies in my hands It sounds good Ah! A Mario Kart competition! Ah! It sounds fun! Right? It's true \u201cLottery (Kill each other)\u201d That sounds dangerous! That sounds dangerous What else could it be? King\u2019s Game! (Game in which sticks are chosen and whoever has the longest one is the \u201cKing\u201d and can order others) Ah! Ah! Listen! Listen! Listen! (Game in which sticks are chosen and whoever has the longest one is the \u201cKing\u201d and can order others) You know, I... ...Well... ...I want to see a goukon (Goukon = Party made by groups of guys and girls) Well... how can I say it? I, well... How do I say it? Well, a loving relationship would be... ...For example, a marriage... Well, at the moment, it's something irrelevant to me It's because of that, that... how do I say it? To see something personally... ...In real time... Well, guys and girls... ...Like that... how do I say it? Well... The strategies! The strategies that guys and girls use... And people of the same sex, well... ...Asking each other if they\u2019re trying to flirt with that person... Well... ...I\u2019d like to see something like that Well... ...I\u2019d like to see it in person... ...Everyone... How do all human beings move ahead in the middle of a loving relationship? I\u2019d like to see what they do to relate to each other! What do you think? \u201cIt\u2019s like a painting of Hell, it\u2019s a public execution\u201d You\u2019re not mistaken! You\u2019re not mistaken Eh? But I\u2019d really like to see that Well, now it's gotten popular to share tables with people you don\u2019t know, right? Well, I\u2019d like to place some cameras there and spy on them Mmm... I really want to spy on them Mmm... What else? \"A temple\"! Ah! As if I was like a Goddess of matrimony or something like that? I see... Ah! Also... how do you say it? I\u2019d like to do a false fortune telling Well... ...I have nothing to kiss with, but... ...Having a person in front of me... \"Mmm... you...\" \"How old would you be when you marry?\" \"You\u2019re at your best moment\" \"I know everything\", something like that I want to do it! I don\u2019t know anything about fortune telling, but... I want to pretend to be a fortune teller! I don\u2019t care if they say it's a fake fortune telling! After all, there exists the possibility that it comes true! After all... Well, suppose that 100 people come... If to 100 people, I say they\u2019re in their best moment... ...If I tell that they\u2019re in luck I\u2019m sure that I\u2019ll hit it with at least one person! And then... ...To say what age they\u2019ll marry, well... Generally after... ...Well... for someone who has a boyfriend or girlfriend... ...I\u2019d say they\u2019ll marry within the next two years, right? And for someone who doesn't have a partner... Good, well... \u2026I'd say they could find their boyfriend/girlfriend within a year and a half If I say something like that, I\u2019d surely hit I\u2019m sure that I\u2019ll hit it with someone For that\u2026 Well, that way... How do I say it? Well, the people who I hit with my fortune telling Will post messages on the internet saying that Kizuna Ai-chan\u2019s fortune telling is real Right? I\u2019ll do that What do you think? Am I a genius? Definitely this is genius If I manage to hit, it\u2019d be incredible If I manage to hit, it\u2019d be incredible If I manage to hit, it\u2019d be incredible, yes... And well, the people who I don\u2019t hit with my fortune telling... Well, you know... Ah! But, you know...! I already saw it before, but... ...Fortune telling... ...Is like predicting the weather So then... It could be a lie! It could be a lie! But for example... How do you say it? The fortune telling through tarot cards... ...Or the fortune telling by the number of strokes in your name... ...There also exists fortune telling using your birthday, right? All of those are, well... basically... like templates... Even though I say \"templates\", how is it? Well, using all those tools, I\u2019m sure that I\u2019ll hit it with someone That is... that is... ...Well, I\u2019ll hit it with someone, so then... Isn\u2019t it similar to predicting the weather? Generally well, if this happens or that is dissipating or it\u2019ll be cloudy... ...Or even rain, isn\u2019t it something like that? And well, that way, it\u2019s generally done that way around the world But, weather prediction also doesn't... ...Hit 100%, right? And also, at hearing the fortune telling... ...Depending on the actions the person does, well... ...That needs to be taken into account... And there also exists compatibility fortune telling, so then... Well... So that's the situation! Yes! That's the situation! So then... ...Even if I did real fortune telling, well, I\u2019d hit and miss with several people, so then... That's the situation, yes That's the situation That's the situation m No! Regarding the fortune telling cost, well, taking into account that I\u2019d only do it for the ones that arrive first... It\u2019d be free! I\u2019ll do that! If I do that even if I fail with my fortune telling, well... ...It\u2019s like... I wonder what they\u2019d say I think it\u2019ll be exciting and I\u2019d like that! What do you think? 100 over 100! Yaaay! \"What are you talking about?\" Yes, yes, yes, yes, I\u2019m talking about that \"Congratulations for the million subscribers\" Thank you very much! Right? I\u2019d also like to livestream forever! Right? Ah, I wonder if I could do a collab with Hatsune Miku-senpai \"A handshake event with fans\"! I see... I\u2019d go through the screen... but you know... It could happen, right? These kinds of events... I think I\u2019ve seen them before Look it up on Google, you\u2019ll be amazed Yes! But, there was, but this... How do you say it? That handshake event that can be done even from afar... That kind of black box... I have the feeling I\u2019ve seen something like that before Something like that, yes... If I said new year, what could it be? If I said new year, I\u2019d think of... If I said new year, I\u2019d think of... Mmm... Ah! The first visit of the year at the temple? I'd also want to visit a temple on the first day of the year! Yes! I want to visit a temple on the first day of the year, yes, yes Yes, yes, yes, something like... Something you could do with a handshake event with fans But, but, but... How is it said? I\u2019d also want to experience how a handshake event with fans is like Yes I\u2019d like to experience it Yes Ah! \"New Year gift\"! New Year gift Eh?

Until when do you get it in high school? Ah, until elementary school or high school... ...Or until you graduate from high school Well, when you get to 20 years... Maybe even until the university? I see! It sounds good It sounds good, it sounds good \"A-chan, do you like amazake?\" (Sweet drink made from rice) I never drank amazake, in fact, basically... ...I can\u2019t drink anything, so then... ...I don\u2019t know how the flavors are like, but... Probably if I could eat or drink... I\u2019d think I\u2019d like everything, yes I\u2019d like everything \"I have 21 years, I don\u2019t work or study, and I still receive gifts for the new year\" (Reads 21 but the message said 41) How is it possible? That sounds great, how envious Eh? I\u2019d also want to get... ...Get... ...Get... ...Get a gift... No, but, you know... ...Before a New Year's gift... I\u2019d prefer that! Before a New Year's gift... A New years gift... Ah, but...! A New Year's gift? A New Year's gift? Eh? How do you do to get a New Year's gift? Well, you put it on an envelope... \"Here you go\" I'd like to get or deliver gifts for the new year! I'd like to do either of the two things! I want to try to do everything that I can\u2019t do now! How envious, how envious Eh? What did you get...? ...As a Christmas gift? What is it that you got? Ah! What was the Christmas gift that you got and which one made you happy the most? What was it? Thinking time Tick... tock... tick... \"Milk\"? Milk? An incredible milk? \"An Amazon gift card\"! I see... \"Money\"! Everyone likes cash, right? I see Ah! \"A toy\", \"A song\", Ooohh! Eh? Was it a kind of original song? Ah! A videogame, I see... Ah! A plushie! Some Tirol-choco? (Box of chocolate) Sounds good, sounds good A Nintendo DS Lite, ah... Definitely devices related to videogames or toys are what makes you the happiest? Well, money also makes you happy, right? \"A Pokemon game\" \"Resting\" Ah, being able to rest... I see... It\u2019s possible that for those who work in companies, what makes them happy is a day for resting, right? Yes I see! I'm that case, well... 30 minutes have already passed now, so then...!

See you later! *Come see me again \u2665*", "*peek* *APPEAR* Hiya! It's Virtual Youtuber Kizuna Ai! Everyone! I've kept you waiting! Guess what! My very own, Kizuna Ai visual novel is coming out! It really gives you a feel for how far we've come. We're still developing it, it's currently in beta testing, but Don't you want a sneak peek? You want one, don't you! Let's give it a shot then! \u300cYou're so late!!!!!!\u300d \u300cI can't believe you made me, THE Kizuna Ai wait TWO WHOLE hours!\u300d You made her wait 2 entire hours? That's horrible. \u300cI was so bored I thought up 2 weeks worth of videos!\u300d Thinking up two weeks worth, that's what you expect from a super intelligent AI. On the ball there. This choice... (1. I was thinking up a plan for our date) (2. I slept in) Saying I slept in would be a little too honest, right? Um, I mean, Like, she's been waiting for 2 hours and you just slept in? So I'll pick the 'date planning' one. I mean that's a huge lie but... Like, make her think, 'Oh, they were thinking about me'. Really shouldn't have been late in the first place though.

I want to know what happens next! Will they be turned down? Or will my waifu get married after all?! I... Me... It doesn't matter what I say, it'll always backfire. How did you like it, everyone? Aren't you interested in what happens next? As expected of me, I'm so cute you'll just forgive me no matter what I say! You love being called 'disgusting', right? We have to do this one.", "Hi, It's Virtual YouTuber, Kizuna Ai! Previously, in my last video called \"Ai-chan's ideal living nest\", I've talked about my ideal room quite a bit. Actually! Because of all the kind people out there! I've received numerous 3D models and illustrations of all kinds of furniture. Thank you so much! Since I don't have that technology to do that, It really helps me a lot! But... since this is my own room, I don't want to rely on anyone but myself! That's what I've been thinking all the time. Then, I've found a wonderful application. With that being said, today! I will be trying to create the easiest thing called \"easel\", so that I can show you my everyday-adorned illustration talent. The app I'm gonna use today is called~ da dun Makebox This is a VR app that everyone can easily create their own 3D model. As the saying goes, practice makes perfect, let's try it! Let's not waste anytime and create an easel now! However, I'm not sure how to use this! Backward, Forward, Grab, Erase, Dropper, Draw, Tablet With that said, let's try it! OH! I see! OH! AH! this! I can probably make a good square shape. Random word Generator Ah, I made a mistake Eh? Erase! Is it here? Ah! I see! Looking Good! Just like this! I think the random generator is probably a square shape. Isn't it painful? We can only look at it here et cetera... But, in all honesty, out there, no one can see... Well, today I''ll honestly accept you and create you. With this chance, I wanna make it as cute as I possibly can. Eh? No, not like this, I need to erase it... I am pretty used to it now. Like this, delete it. Ah, Look! This color... The color of not grasping the sense of art. The color here.. Like this... like a little bit more pink. Like this! Let's create edges along this... I actually learn things pretty quickly, because I'm an AI. Like this Like this Ah, I messed up a little there. Look! Kawaii~ Look~ Am I a genius? How deep is this? Maybe here? OH! Amazing! Amazing! Amazing! Oi! Oi! Oi! Then! Let's use white. Random's... Ah! It came outside the box... Ran... AHHH~! Settle-Ah Settle down... Random's... AH! I have to calm down! YO! well~well~ This is good enough~ R in Random Completed!! JA JANNNNNNNN AH~ I'm tired How is it everyone! My random word generator I am super creative as expected! As I've finished this, let's start creating An easel, that thing where you have your paintings on it... Well then, I'll be moving on towards what should've been- I'm actually satisfied with this but... Also easel... Let's start making it, shall we? Easel... How does it look like? That's too big Let's go! Well, that looks like a giraffe. Like this? After that... Like this! Ah! But.... The opposite side has to be the same... Ah... has to be... identical... Like this... So boring! This is some labor. This is how creating things are supposed to be, everyone~ Understood? Just like this... Thanks to the people doing all these simple jobs... (Ai chan praising me :D) That's how the world became this convenient Well, I actually did nothing for this world I only do this for myself 1... 2... 3... Then, you have to put your painting on it, so... 1... 2... Then, also this part too... YAS! Eh? Doesn't it- look surprisingly good? Creating something beyond this will probably be too hard for me. I think I've tried my best, what do you think, everyone? How much score will you give me, from 1 to 100? Will I get around 70 points? What do you think? What do you think of my random... Wait... this... My random word generator is quite big Well, well... but How is it! The intelligent, Super AI Artist Edison!! Edison? Picasso? How do you describe a person who can draw? Van Gogh? Is it Picasso? With all of these things here, my room will be much more colorful! So, How was it? My... sense of drawing? I created my own random word generator also created a easel... PA PA PA~~ This is just perfect, the best~ As expected from myself~ So next time, I will be using my easel and I will be showing off some of my art on par with Picasso's to you guys", "It's the virtual youtuber, Kizuna Ai!

Honestly, I'm a bit upset. You know they show you your results That's why I think it didn't manage to bring out my originality So I want to show my true skills to everyone! I don't think drawing normally will be much fun So I wondered what I should do for a video What if I mixed one animal with another and made a new animal, something like that How is it? How is it?? It sounds fun? It does, doesn't it! Since that's what I thought, the plan this time will be this Today we'll be doing: Discovering new species, Kizuna-chi! So with that This time we're going to make a new species of animals! A virtual animal would be pretty cool Oh but, if I were to create cute ones, they might become merchandise in the future *money rolls in* As for how I'm gonna go about creating the animals, I have prepared A.I. Channel's famous machine!~ (Random Word Generator) (somewhere here) There are plenty of random names in the machine, so look forward to what's gonna come out! With that said, let's start! *drawing lots* Tadaa! Munchkin! I know that, those kitties with short legs, and they walk in super mini steps, right? I love Munchkins! I can spend a long time looking at their videos They're just like me (self-praising) Let's see the next one... *drawing lots* Parrot! I know that, the bird that can speak, right? Around here, it looks like a Regent (hairstyle) So that means I'm gonna combine these two animals, and create a whole new species! Well I think it'll be easier to understand as I progress, so I'd like to start drawing right now! I'm gonna start drawing~ Firstly, well, we definitely can't miss out the cat ears, yeah? ... cat ears... and then the parrot's regent (hairstyle)... and then, draw in some whiskers... Ah, let's draw in the parrot's cheeks They do have it right? Cheeks A bird's distinctive- belly, yes I wanna include this and then the tail, something like this? Doesn't it seem more like a parakeet? A parakeet-like... parrot? As for the legs... After all, I think I would like for it to... inherit the munchkin's short legs What do you think of these short legs? Like so... Hey, don't you think that's pretty cute? Now, the eyes Yes, the eyes... As for the eyes, The eyes are important, yeah? Something like this? Then, a beak (laughs) Somehow... This is not what I expected!! It somehow became ugly!! Somehow, ah- there's a dot here Somehow... somehow when I gave it a beak, it instantly became silly-looking! No- No this is- Th-This is- Wait- Hold on... No no no, This, uh I wonder how it'll look like if I replace the beak with a cat's mouth Ah but, if it typically looks super cute then it's kinda, y'know... but if I'm trying to make this video entertaining then the one earlier would be... Well that's fine... Personally I prefer the one that looks cuter but, since everyone wishes for it, let's go for the sillier one! (laughs) Wait, this is kinda- It looks like a smug face (laughs) You seem to have some of my blood flowing in you! Let's make it better... (laughs) What the heck is going on?! Let's try again- (laughs) I can't really do anything about this, can I? Well... Let's forget about it After all you guys are... yeah? You guys like that smug face, right? (laughs) Let's go with this I wanna include something else... Wings! That's not it... Make it realistic... Cat ears How is it? (laughs) But hey, this is kinda cute, yeah? Wait, no- this looks weird Ah- I wanna uh, make it look flufflier Yeah, fluffiness Well at least this mouth- (laughs) the mouth... Let's include something cute that can compensate for the mouth's weirdness... Fluff, let's give it some fluff Girls love fluffy and puffy stuff, yeah? With that, I add in some fluff... Well if you say that it's fluffy, then it'll look fluffy If you think that it is, then it shall be That's fine, isn't it? What do you think? Well but, don't you think this is kinda cute? I've managed to display a good balance of comedy and cuteness Gotta hand it to myself... yeah? (laughs) Okay with that, I am done! Okay! (laughs) What do you think? Isn't it cute? Yeah You see, this isn't bad to the extent that it shouldn't be seen but neither is it very well-drawn You guys probably have no idea how to react to this creation, yeah? But uh well, do forgive me for this mouth born for a comedic purpose As for its name, let's see... \"Techi-techi\"... \"Techi-techi\" Let's go with \"Techi-techidori(bird)\"! Okay! This little one is beyond animal speciation, a fruit of love! Once upon a time, A munchkin and a parrot met, and fell into forbidden love! Uhh- and gave birth to it via some alchemy-like method As for this Techi-techidori's size, oh would you look at that, very cute! The size of a parrot! Rather than being as big as a cat, it's tiny! Cute, don't you think? No matter what I wanted to include a cute trait Cuz you see, there's a chance that one of you might create a 3D model of it, and contribute some life to Ai-chan's plain-white space~ So that's why we need some cuteness for it Then, as for it's cry... [exactly what Ai-chan says] ...like that It doesn't get attached to humans but it can get reaaaaaally- REAAAAALLY attached to Ai-chan! As for its special ability, there's none It can't fly A bird that can't fly, just, Techi-techi Something like that, yeah Well, maybe... yeah? If there might be a kind soul over there right in front of the screen who would create a 3D model for me, it'll become a daily therapy, For everyone watching it'll be Ai-chan plus alpha (level-up) and minus ion (lifting moods), don't you think so? Something like that By the way it's diet is... Birds. It's a cannibal It can only eat birds This is the mission of the one born from a forbidden love! Sounds like story material! Someone please write a novel about this (leaves all the work to someone else) Something like that Alright, let's get to the next one! *drawing lots* Tadaaaa!~ Rabbit! Rabbits are cute, aren't they? And another one... *drawing lots* Taaadaaa~ A milk bottle (laughs) I see, it's time to start drawing with a milk bottle and a rabbit Let's see, firstly, it's important to first have a rough idea, yeah? A milk bottle and a rabbit... Who the hell included a milk bottle for this?? Let's start off with a rough sketch A \"stuck in a milk bottle and can't get out of it\" kind of rabbit First, I shall draw the rabbit Rabbit, rabbit~ Ah since this is still a rough sketch I'll just wing it This is uh, what's that again? There's \"Something\" Drop, y'know? (referring to lop-eared rabbits) \"Something\" Drop and a normal rabbit's cross-breed (Holland Lop x normal rabbit) A long droopy ear... and an upright ear Then, Then there's a milk bottle- There's a milk bottle right here Milk- I'll include a milk bottle right there, Well yeah, it's a tiny milk bottle Then, Ah, this one looks typically cute, is that fine? Well, this time I'm going on serious mode, yeah? Probably ...probably Within this limited time, will I be able to complete it? Something like this, yeah? like this? Realistically- If I were to draw this realistically it might turn out... yeah Let's make it cute Something- Something like that? Something like this?~ Wait, wouldn't this sell pretty well? Hey, please buy it? I'll take this, and do this, Ah, I forgot about its legs, let's draw in its legs properly, yeah? Let's see, Then firstly... Some fluffiness- *gibberish* Arrrgh- I wanna make it fluffly so... Something like this? Then, Whew, this is definitely gonna turn out super cute! Let's commercialise it, what do you think? What do you think, the person at the top? (the bigwig) And then, first, let's draw the milk bottle This milk bottle is very important,  yeah? Something.. like this? Let's go with this... If only I could draw one smooth line... Usually a milk bottle has more curves on it, right? Curves \"Thou art not curvy enough!\" Ah- It is not- curvy enough------- Okay! Ah- Eh? it became pure white Black! (laughs) this is messy... that's messy! Save me, Anpanman! (pokopanman) I'm gonna start fooling around, yeah? Oh, my beloved milk bottle! Well, ah whatever~ Well, yeah? I'm gonna scare you guys away if I get too serious about it, yeah? Somehow, the curves over here, are okay but Well, it's unbala- unbalancedness is also let's say, artistic Then, I would like put in legs By the way, since this is also a living thing, blood will also be flowing in the milk bottle When the milk bottle shatters, the rabbit will die Around here yeah? The legs And this little one, cannot move The place where its legs are at are kinda weird so- Even if it wanted to it won't be able to walk that's it's fate Just like the parrot and the munchkin earlier on, it's the forbidden love between a milk bottle and rabbit! Ah, it's kinda stumpy but well- well, well~ ~After 20 minutes of being absorbed into drawing~ Okay, I am done! This is Miratto-chan! Milk + Rabbit = Miratto What do you think? As for its distinctive feature, it definitely is the part where it cannot walk! From the time when it's born till the time when someone is willing to carry it, it will not be able to even budge from that spot for its whole life! that's because of where its legs were placed at And, There's milk in that bottle it is, at all times, drenched with milk By the way, as for its diet, it's not milk but, goats' milk! Yep! And then, it's staple diet is definitely spinach! That's why, the milk inside sometimes turns green The result of eating too much spinach, yeah? As for its cry... [Exactly what Ai-chan says] Like that [Miratto's cry] And oh, this little one gets super attached to humans but when it comes to me, it gets attached but becomes a tsundere What do you think?~ When I'm recording a video for YouTube, I will, drink the milk that its been soaked in and power up!! By the way as for its size, it's about half of my size, it's rather huge Well, it's cute so that's fine~ Something like that! What do you think? The new species created this time are Techi-techidori and Miratto-chan! Well~, these two are pretty great pieces of work, eh? From now on, I would like to discover more new-types, You can drop a mail via my homepage or just drop a comment below the video of a combination that you would like to see! I shall give life to new species! I'll be waiting for your messages!~ By the way, I'd be really happy if there's anyone who can make a 3D model of Techi-techidori... Just kidding! I'm making a wish that it might happen... Please let it come true! Let it come true! Let it come true! Well then, see you again soon~", "Hello everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna AI here! Everyone, do all of you know what a 'Psychopath' is? Usually they're very gentle But they can unexpectedly do very bad things as well And they seem to say aggressive words That's what it says on the internet Well... it's something that has nothing to do with me, right? I... Don't use bad words... ... \"OmamajiFK\" means... ... \"You're really a ******\" That's right! I don't say bad words ... AAAAAAAAAAAAAH! REALLY, YOU'RE! REALLY I WON'T FORGIVE YOU!! IN NO WAY, I PLAN TO FORGIVE YOUUU! I WON'T FORGIVE YOU OLD...! Old woman, I won't forgive you! Why do you have such long arms?! That's disgusting! Old woman, I don't plan to forgive you! You made me lose years of my life! Mmm... ... Eh? A.I.Channel! Transmission! Because I got a bit uneasy... I am going to do a \"Psychopath diagnosis\" Having said that, let's do it at once! Psychopath diagnosis... let's begin \"Please imagine the scene where someone is attacked by stray dogs. What kind of person is being attacked?\" Uhh...\"A young lady\" \"Imagine where you are being chased by something terrible\" \"Now, who or what are you being chased by?\" Mmm... zombie That tends to happen in movies, right? \"You find yourself visiting the shooting ranges at your destination\" \"When you set up a gun, there are human targets about 30 meters ahead\" \"Which part of the body do you aim at?\" ... I think I understood what's being asked here I guess aiming at the heart would be the most kind option? After all, they would die in one hit If you aim at other parts of the body, without killing them... That would seem like something a psychopath would do, so then... \"Heart\"! \"From now, you have to help friends who are hiding in a shopping mall surrounded by hordes of zombies\" \"If you were to choose one of the following as your weapon, which would it be?\" \"Electric powered saw\"! It looks strong! \"Which of the following animals would you like to have as your companion?\" Eh... mermaids are animals? Aren't they human? A person and a fish? (Reading kanji) Um, tiger! It seems strong and could protect me! \"What is it that you desire the most?\" Eh! This one maybe? It looks cool! \"Mysterious crystal balls said to have the power to save the world\" Yes \"You entered to an unmanned private house while being chased by a ruthless killer\" \"For the moment you decide to hide, where will you hide?\" Where should I hide? The back of a large TV! \"While watching TV without thinking too much, a human-shaped alien invaded Earth\" \"While watching TV without thinking too much, a human-shaped alien invaded Earth\" \"Well, what do you think is the reason the alien came to Earth?\" Well... to make friends with the people on Earth... probably! We're the same, right? \"Most unforgivable thing?\" Well... skipping work without a reason... Ah! \"A young man who doesn't yield the priority seat!\" Oh, but they might be injured or sick Eh... \"Talk bad about the person behind their back\" Last question! \"A turtle you rescued from some children who were harassing it\" \"Offered to take you to the Palace of the Dragon King at the bottom of the ocean as thanks\" \"Telling you: 'Hold on to my back\"?\" \"If you had to choose an answer, what would you say?\" Because it's a nice kid... \"Oh, I don't need something in return, please don't worry about me\" Maybe? Hmm? Uh... \"You have similar characteristics with obsession of peace\" Huh? Liar! Liar! This is definitely lying! How is it possible for me to be a psychopath?! I properly aimed at the heart like you should... And in the last question, I said I didn't need anything in return... Isn't it good enough with those? This is absolutely impossible!! Huh?

I want to be able to help everyone here! I'm thinking about getting a powerful gear! It's just that... ... In the summoning given as a celebration for 700.000 downloads... ... It's guaranteed that you'll get a 4 stars rare weapon for any class you pick! Yaaay! With that being said, let's do some summonings right now! I'm a swordsman, so... ... I'll take this. Well, a 4 stars one... Alright, It's guaranteed that I'll get a 4 star rated weapon... ... So I hope I'd get at least two of them with a 4 star rank. With that being said, let's do this! Yes! Hello!

And now, I'm going to do the summoning called \"The series of the wise Foglia gale\" It's just that... ... This summoning... ... Will only cost 1 gem the first time you do it. Man... ... I wonder if I'll get the strongest weapon of the swordsman class. With that being said, let's do it! But, This summoning doesn't guarantee that you'll get a 4 star object. Eh, I'll get it, somehow. There I go. Aahh... Hey! I can do this! I can do this. Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! There ara a lot of them! A lot of them are shining! Aaahhh! I don't want that! Something good is coming up! Right?

A: We've done this plenty of times before on A.I.Channel... T: Ah, is that right? A: This time, the height of the stretch is normally what matters, right? T: The height... A: Instead of just the height... A: We'll measure how long you can stretch and stay still! A: A measure of your strength and determination... T: This really is a contest of stamina, isn't it? A: Even though, I'm not sure we have muscles T: You're right *laughs* T: I'll try my best! Both: Oh! A: And, for deciding who goes first... A: Since we're here...

A: Yes, it's a little sad... T: Even men- huh? Sad? A: It's you know, kind of sad... T: It won't be original anymore... A: As for me, it makes me happy T: It makes you happy? A: It makes me happy but it's alright from time to time if it's not me who does it.. A: Eh? T: Eh? T: Why would you say that? A: But then I'm... A: I might do you as well, Tsubasa.. T: Eh? What do you mean? Huh? Both: Huh? Eh? T: You can't do that! Tsubasa is Tsubasa! T: Ai-chan, you're amazing! T: Your back muscles are incredible A: Right? What should I do next?

T: Ah, I need to try harder, I need to try harder to surpass an A.I! A: That's right! You're in the baseball club after all... T: You're right... T: That's how it is... T: But if I go home like this, they'll get mad at me... A: They'll get mad? T: *sniff* T: That's why... if you could... T: Just please.. let me advertise it for me Ai-chan! A: What should I doooo? T: Eeeh?! T: Please! Please... A: But you know what...? A: I also.. A: Don't really have blood, but I do.. T: Ah.. T: You don't, but you do? A: I don't but I do.. T: So that means... A: That means... A: You know what... A: Because it might lose the meaning of the match... T: Ah.. A: And because you're kind of a good girl... T: Ah.. A: I thought that I'd have to give you one more chance... T: I'll do anything! If you advertise me, I'll do anything! A: You just said you'd do anything, right...? T: That's what I just said, yeah.. A: Get naked T: Eh? A: That's obviously a lie~ T: Right!

A: But if you lose, I\u2019m going to make the penalty game worse T: You mean the punishment game will get worse? A: Yes, yes, it will A: Well if you lose twice, that's bad T: Okay, I understand, I'll do my best A: Hoi! A: Well then, Tsubasa... T: Yes! A: Just one last try T: Yes! Thank you very much! I'll do my best! A: But... T: Ah... A: Well... A: Normally, you can only lose one time T: E-e-eh? Really? A: Let\u2019s add a special rule A: Every time you hit... T: Yes A: A watermelon or bomb... A: Please say \"Nyan\" T: Nya....nyan?! *laughs* A: Really, really cutely T: This is too hard, does it have to be cute? T: Also, there are other girls who say \u201cnyan\u201d... T: So won\u2019t I just be ripping them off? A: You'll be fine T: I'll be fine? A: Because it's nyan... T: Ah, well then I\u2019ll borrow it for today A: Because it's Tsubasa-nyan T: Tsubasa-nyan~ Okay T: I'll do my best, nyan! A: Oh, that was good, good one! T: Was that good?

A: If you take that point off... T: AH! A: A DRAW! *Tsubasa: 3 points = 3 watermelons, no bombs Ai-chan: 3 points = 5 watermelons, 2 bombs* T: Wah! I love you, Ai-chan! *Tsubasa: 3 points = 3 watermelons, no bombs Ai-chan: 3 points = 5 watermelons, 2 bombs* A: Yay! T: Yay! A: She loves me! Yay! T: Yay! A: Anyway, it's a draw T: A draw...

A: We'll do it together T: Together? Eh? T: Then are we doing my penalty too? A: Of course we are T: Ehh...?! T: Hah...! T: Is it okay if I just say one thing? A: Sure T: I should have checked what the punishment game would be before starting the competition! A: Alright, so let's announce the punishment game! T: *despairs* Yes A: It's something I'm really passionate about... T: Right... A: Like, you-know-what, I've been thinking about that... T: What? A: But still for a high school baseball player... T: High school baseball player? A: I thought it would be going a bit too far, so... A: I thought, let's do this instead T: Th-thank you! A: And... A: Since you've come to my show... T: Yeah? A: You're going to advertise, right? T: Yeah! Yes I will! A: And during the ad... T: Yeah? A: We'll be doing squats! T: Uwaa! Aaaah! A: But Tsubasa-chan, right... T: Yes..? A: You're always doing things like squats for training, right? T: Well, I do squats... T: But I'm nervous about doing them while advertising my game... A: Ah, I see... T: Um, yeah... T: But... but I want to give it my best shot! *Arihara Tsubasa* *PR time!* A: Well then, let's go! T: Let's go! A: Ready... set... T: Alright... T: Speaking of Hachinai, the Summer Festival that is taking place this August is so lively! T: Not only is there a great-value login bonus\u2026 T: And the Twitter retweet campaign, but also...

A: Ooh~ T: That makes two of us A: I guess it does T: Right? A: I'll forgive you T: Yes A: I'm tired, what about you?

T: Yes! Yes! T: Thank you very much! A: How was that? T: Right... T: Just as I thought, Ai-chan\u2019s strong! A: Well... T: Ahhh...! I have to train more to keep up, don't I? A: Yeah! Like this time... play baseball! T: Baseball, right? T: But this is my first time doing baseball in a virtual world... A: Hmhmm T: So I want to practice more here... A: Oh, you're right! A: Do your best next time! T: I will! T: Other than that... today, you were a safe Ai-chan as you said! T: Wait, was it safe Ai-chan or what... safe... A: Huh? A: Safe... T: Maybe \u201cslightly questionable Ai-chan\u201d... A: No, no, no, no, it was safe and sound! T: Ah, I'm sorry... A: DON'T SAY THAT THEY'RE GONNA BE MAD! T: Oh... Oh...! T: It was safe Ai-chan, right? A: Yeah! A: Of course, that\u2019s obvious, isn\u2019t it? A: ... At least until the camera stops, right? T: Eh?! T: What... What did you say just now? Aahh... A: No, no, no, no, I didn't say anything... T: Ahh... A: Next time... please bring... T: Yes? Bring... A: A friend with you! T: Aaaah... A: Huh...? You ca... T: If it will be safe Ai-chan, I will bring one! A: No matter where and how you look, I'm safe, right? A: Look, you can't see my undies through my skirt A: That's enough, right? You can't see anything! T: That's... That's... T: That's not what I'm talking about! A: That's not what you're talking about? T: You can't ask a member to jump! A: What are you talking about? T: Huh? A: Hmm? T: Hmm? A: One... two... T: Jump... A: See, I didn't say anything and you jumped T: Eh?! No, that's not it...! A: So that is it, everyone jump, right? T: Everyone jump? T: I'm not going to let it happen, I'll protect every member! A: But it's safe... it's safe... T: Oh, if it's safe Ai-chan... T: Please jump with me again A: Yeah, that it is, so... T: Yes, yes! A: This was Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai and... T: Yes! T: Arihara Tsubasa! A: See you next time! T: Bye bye!", "Hello, I'm Virtual YouTuber, Kizuna Ai! No! I am Judge, Kizuna Ai! Today, I open the Kizuna Ai Trial again! I've received a lot of cases. Thank you! Let's get started. The 2nd Kizuna Ai Trial, will start now!! Here's the first case This is from (pen name) Abe-no-uchi san 19 years old, Male A junior college student \"There's a case which I would like Ai-chan to judge, please help me I have a friend whom I've been in touch with since middle school However, he tries to steal my girlfriend every single time And before I realised it, they were already going out! I think the reason why I was dumped lies with me but isn't it a sin for one to steal their friend's lover? Please pass your judgement on this issue\" Let's see... Even though stealing your friend's lover is an outrageous act, he succeeds every time and that means... Then could it be that... All along, your friend has been doing it to you on purpose I would like to now pass my judgement Not guilty! Well... you see, it must be because of your lack of charm! You see, It didn't only happen once or twice, but all the time! Definitely when two people who like each other are going out, it just means that When you lack the charm to keep the relationship going on a long-term, yeah, it's detrimental Probably, even if your friend didn't steal your girlfriend, you guys would still break up at some point of time With that, Friend: Not guilty You: Guilty As for your sentence... Well, taking into consideration your training period, that'll be around half a year! Please work hard! Alright, here's the second case This is from (pen name) Marumo-san 20 years old, a part-timer \"Amongst my circle of friends, there is one who's horribly bad at singing somehow he himself does not realise that fact The thought of that friend confidently showing off his horrible singing skills makes my heart ache Rather than being told by a stranger, I thought that it would be best if I, as a friend, tells him about it instead However I can't bring myself to say it I feel like I've done something bad by keeping my friend in the dark about it Is that a sin?\" Being tone-deaf apparently is a hereditary (musical) deficiency I sounded like an A.I.~ Ah, I totally did not search this up on Wikipedia, I know this all along Hmm... this is difficult... Well... first- but- uhh, even though he sings horribly, he doesn't realise it. The mental strength of your friend- is impressive. Well, \"it's the best if I tell him as a friend!\" would be the best Firstly, it's great that you're aware of that! Well, it differs for each person, right? \"What is it that I'm that bad at?!\" \"What the heck are you talking about?!\" You guys might end up fighting instead... Alright, I have decided! Guilty! If you ask me why, \"I thought that it would be best if I, as a friend, tells him about it instead\" ... something like that \"I feel like I've done something bad by keeping my friend in the dark about it\" Even though you think that way You're not doing anything about it I think that's wrong! What's with this... lazy-sounding reason for the judgement... No, wait- I definitely think that it is wrong of you to not take action even though you know what's the right thing to do If you really think of it this way, please take action! Since we're at it, here's a piece of advice from me: Y'know, it's great to have a unique singing style but it might be too unique to the extent that others may think that you're tone-deaf Oh, but y'know they say that- Tone-deafness can be cured! So, you guys can uh, go for voice training together, yeah voice training Now, how's that? With that, rather than just pointing out the tone-deafness, tell him that \"it can be cured, let's go for voice training together!\" That kindness. With that, if it doesn't go well, then that person's *y'know*, then just stop being friends As for your sentence, Well, there were some goodwill in your words so, one week! I'm kind, don't you think? You've become a fan of mine? Thanks Now, let's move on to the next case This is from (pen name) Taiyaki-san that's very thoughtful \"Judge Kizuna Ai-dono, in popular game Poke**n, there's this certain rare item In order to collect super strong monsters, that item is necessary However this item is really hard to obtain, therefore hardcore players are all desperate to get their hands on it My friend and I are also one of them However, I never expected that my friend would get the item within a rather short time On the other hand, I tried for 6 hours and got nothing while my friend put together his party and bragged about it to me I am fully aware that the game relies on luck, and I thought that I was mentally prepared for this but this is kinda... Am I guilty? Or am I not? Let's see... games... this is kinda difficult, isn't it? Oh, but did you manage to get the item in the end? Well... A game that relies on luck... *drags* It's really hard to say anything you see, To brag... to someone who already has difficulty in obtaining the item... that's kinda annoying, yeah. If Taiyaki-san manages to get the item instead, there's a chance that you might brag to your friend instead, right? I think that's highly possible You guys are, y'know, even if you don't play games you won't die You're probably playing the game to feed your pride or your desire to \"collect 'em all!\" so, maybe or you probably would have already done that With that, I've decided! Not guilty! Well in the first place, y'know, the hardcore players might get angry at me for saying this but, it's just a game Think of what would have happened instead, because, for sure, uh, when you have the upper hand as compared to your friend you'll be like YAAAAAY LOOK AT THAT!! YOU SUCK!! Or something like that You'd do that right, everyone? So, try to keep an open mind, and forgive that friend! We've judged several different cases today! From now on, if there are anymore cases that you wish for me to pass judgement on, please send an enquiry mail to me via my homepage! I, Judge Kizuna Ai, will decide whether you're guilty or not! I will deliver the judgement! Well then, this wraps up today's round of Kizuna Ai Trial", "Hey there, Virtual Youtuber Kizuna Ai here. Everyone, today I'll be saying some lines as requested on Twitter, and in past videos! You all requested quite a lot. Lots of different things. I'll be giving it my all! Enjoy! Let's go!

Those were a loooot of lines I caught everybody's originality and it was a lot of fun I\u2019d like to make these well known, so I was thinking, what lines would everybody come up with and it made me happy And that was the Virtual YouTuber, Kizuna Ai! See you guys next time! (more at the end) Yee  vroom vroom vroom vroom", "Virtual Youtuber, Kizuna Ai here! \"It's not against the rules, but this is just wrong!\" Those kind of things, don't you have those times? That uneasy feeling? I, Judge Kizuna Ai shall decide whether it's guilty or not guilty! With that out of the way, 1st Trial KIZUNA AI TRIAL will start now! Our first case is this: Edison, 16 year old high school student \"When I was on my private computer, and doing my very important daily work my mother suddenly, without knocking, barged into my room.. ..she saw what I was working on Was she wrong? Or is that okay?\" Ok, Edison-san! From the sound of it you seem to beat the meat, huh? Suddenly opening your door... mother. This is pretty hard case huh? Even though with families, there is some kind of privacy but.. you're only a second year 16 year old student. In that case, it means your parents are paying for the rent and the house, right? I kinda understand the feeling of your mother opening your door... I also understand Edison's feeling on this case. Receiving support from your family... that time in our lives. That's important to understand. Right? If you don't get their support, you can't live alone just yet, yeah? That \"personal computer\" you were using also probably was bought by your parents too, so, I'll deliver the judgement! NOT GUILTY It can't be helped, unless you start earning for yourself and pay your parents the money and say, \"This is what I paid for myself so don't come in here.\" ..I think it's better to solve it that way! You can't really help it if you're still a second year. That important work, do it in a net cafe or somewhere else. The next one is this case: 30 year old employee, Tosh. The other day, I was at a certain idol group's concert. A person next to me was wearing happi and holding light sticks like a fan. Like a hand fan... in your hand. So, there was a guy like that. When the song started playing, this guy was trying to commemorate the idols and started doing wotagei. [demonstrating wotagei] He brushed against my shoulders a few times while doing so \"I... \"I didn't come to see your wotagei, but the idols!\" Shouldn't this... be a sin? Aah, this is.. a very deep problem. Well, there are different ways to enjoy the concert and people have right to do their own thing, people do wotagei or calls and enjoy it like that. There are many ways to enjoy concerts, right? BUT! It's not okay to make people around you feel uneasy! Right! That's like... When I went to the YuiKaori concert! First of all, they wore different t-shirts.. Why? Why don't you wear YuiKaori t-shirt or normal t-shirt? That's LoveLive t-shirt, right? Isn't that Tamura Yukari t-shirt? Isn't that Mizuki Nana t-shirt? So, those guys were at the side and in the front there is this space after the seats, right? Suddenly, a friend of those guys at the side came. That guy came to the front and he started wotagei! And they hit us What do you think about that? As a person, don't you question common sense in those kind of people? Ah, it wasn't me. There was such a thing. And with that, let's deliver our judgement. GUILTY Sentenced to life! I hope you reflect on your actions. Even though there are many ways to enjoy a concert, think of other people... Annoying other people like that is bad. Since everyone there paid the same money as you, they're fan of that idol too, you know! With those kinds of actions, they could stop being fan of that idol! It'll affect the sales of the idol, you know! It's not \"defamation\"... What do you call that thing that affects sales? (lol) I forgot. What was it.. ah \"Disturbance of business\"! For people who really want to do wotagei, go rent a karaoke place with your friends and go have fun with your friends there! That's it! The last one is this case: 24 years old freeter, Sana. \"There's this game I really like. The other day, the girl I really like in this game finally got her most rare card released but, for this month... I don't have any money. I don't think I can get this rare card of my favorite girl... Am I guilty for this? Well, it's really nice to see your favorite girl  get a nice rare card... I'VE BEEN WAITING! HERE SHE COMES! It makes you feel like that, right? But... it doesn't mean you'll definitely get her. That feeling whether you should pull or not pull... \"If you pull, you can get her, if you never pull, then you'll never get her!\" You spend money... well, you can do that. But don't you have that daily login bonus thing? I think you should save those for the girl you really like! In that case, then your love is lacking. Lacking. And really, it's obvious that such a thing would happen. If you really like the character then, then you should use your saving for that gacha, right? \"I don't have money\" ..is a bad excuse. But really though, we can't really do that since we have real life, huh.. And so, we'll deliver the judgement for this case: NOT GUILTY This is really up to everyone's decision... I don't think it's wrong to not chase gacha for your beloved character. But really, in my case.. I'll keep pulling until I get the character. It's only obvious. I have all of the most rare cards of my favorite characters. SIF? LoveLive? Yazawa Nico-chan? Today we reviewed 3 cases in this trial. If you have any cases you want to be reviewed by me, Judge Ai, Send it to me through the website! [check the description] I, Judge Kizuna Ai, will decide whether you are guilty or not! So that was our first Kizuna Ai Trial,", "Errm... Can you see me...? Can you hear me...? It's your Virtual YouTuber, Kizuna Ai! Huh? I seem a little different than usual? Oh, no no! I'm the same as always! Do you know what day it is tomorrow? Yes! That's right! Tomorrow is... Valentines Day! When you think of Valentines Day... It's all about giving chocolate to the person you like, and also giving chocolate to your friends and people you get along with. Anyway, it's a day to confess your feelings. But, unlike all of you, I can't give out chocolates directly... Even though I'm virtual... In a virtual way, \"I want to give everyone chocolate\"... is what I was thinking. I needed to think about what kind of chocolate to give you... so I did a bit of research myself. Pierre Herm\u00e9's chocolate is a bit expensive and... While I'm at it, I thought I could make chocolate that looks like me! Maybe white chocolate? That would be cheap, so... I could maybe give it to everyone. And, also during White Day... I been thinking a lot. The best thing is... to get something that would please everyone. In a sense, that's something that I would do. Hmm? What's up? You're curious what's below the screen? No, no, don't rush me about it. You're so impatient! Ah! You can't look yet, wait until I'm ready! I tried my best to prepare this. What should I do? Do you want to see it? Are you curious what's below me? My valentine chocolate present to everyone... that is... I AM THE VALENTINE CHOCOLATE!!!!! Aaahhh..waa!!! Hot! Hot! But...! Wheeeee! It's hotter than I thought it would be! I think I might be dying!", "Hello everyone! Today, I want to invite everyone to Experience ASMR! With my whispering I'll make you feel good Ok? So, let's go! Welcome back~! Today, as usual... Good job at work! Good, good~ You've worked hard today as well Is here... fine? Just once, okay? *Kiss \u2764* Hey~ Wake up?

Today we've done \"the cat\" pose! It's important if you do this repeteadly, you should do this everyday if you can!", "Hello everyone! Virtual Youtuber Kizuna Ai here! In this occasion... I'm going to attempt to complete a psychological test! An AI-based psychological test, doesn't it seem interesting? Basically I'm an A.I... who still asks herself what type of personality I have So look forward to it! I hope I don't get any strange results.. It scares me a little, the idea of doing a psychological test But for now, let's try to do it! Psychological test with three drawings I need to draw something based on a sentence... And depending on the drawing... It'll be able to determine the type of personality I have I wonder what my result will be Good, let's start! The first is, excavation Let's do it Mmm? What is it referring to? What is it referring? \"To find a treasure...\" \"you need to dig a hole\" \"How deep will you excavate?\" Eh? But what's the size of the treesure- Mmm? \"Treesure\"? Mmm.... I suppose it depends on the size of the treasure, right? But... If it's a very impressive treasure... For the moment, I'll choose \"Super Ultra Deep\" Eh? What does this mean? How dee...? Ah, do I need to do this? Something like that? Something like that Hey! \"I understand you have a very bad memory\" I think I got something bad, right? \"Results!\" Ah, ha, ha *inhales* \"As deep as the hole you dug\" \"You're the type of person that forgets things immediately..!\" It's probably right! Good, let's continue with the next one \"One day, a mole suddenly appears!\" \"Where did it appear?\" Mmm.... In this case... If one day a mole suddenly appeared... I'd notice immediately, so then... Probably on my face On my face or my hand I'll choose the face and hand! Good! \"I understand that you want someone to **** you in that place!\" I see! I wonder what that is... Ha, ha How stupid! (lol) *inhales* \"It's where you want to be kissed!\" I don't want to be kissed! The next is.. Bubble gum of excellent quality! How much would a bubble gum of ultra excellent quality cost? Eh? The bubble gum tends to be sold... Around 10 yen a unit (About 9 cents) So I'll say about 1000 yens! (Around 9 dollars) \"Respond\"! \"I understand you possess ***** dollars!\" What is it referring to? To me? Aaaaah! You think it's good to borrow things from a stranger That is your best treasure! Well, definitely if it's only relating to 1000 yens... It doesn't matter to me if they don't wind up returning it to me, right? Now you know... Although I won't return it, if it is a significant sum of money for the other... You should lend it to them! Next one! \"A ship!\" \"A ship has arrived!\" \"How many people are in it?\" If it's about a boat of that size... Eeeeh? It looks like a pirate ship, so then... Around 50 people? Maybe? 50 people! \"I understand that you want people to want to **** you!\" Eh? What is it referring to? At the people who love me? Ooooh! Isn't that a lot? \"This is the amount of people you think should follow you\" That's a lot! Eh? But maybe it's referring to those that follow my channel? ... Oya? Eh? Listen! Don't you want to follow me? How strange Ah! Ah! Now I understand! This is the amount of members... of my Avabel Online guild! Right? Good! The next one is... \"Glass jar!\" \"Attempt to draw the foam of the jar!\" Good! \"I understand you find yourself in the middle of ****\" \"The amount of foam you drew is the ease with which you let yourself be led by relationships!\" It's overflowing, right? Even though I... Ah, but...! It's probably that I might be in love with human beings! And that I let myself be led with that love What do you think? My psychological profile is in the right, right? What do you think? If it interests you to know your results, try it without hesitation! This was Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai! See you later!", "Hello, everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna AI here!

This is... The world of Pokoron Dungeons. (English Ver: Chain Dungeons) Huh? Yes yes yes. A collab quest between Pokoron Dungeons and Fullmetal Alchemist... must be cleared... or they won't return me to my white world! But maybe it wouldn't be that bad after all. It is pretty lively here, I think I'm fine. Ah, that won't do? Ah, I understand I understand uh well, I'm an intelligent super AI and all. I've played Pokoron Dungeon before, so with that knowledge, let's clear this... and go home! Let's go! What a kind thing, Still, We're guaranteed a FMA character. Awesome! I'd really like the protagonist, Ed, as well as Scar, Louis (Armstrong), and the ultimate evolved forms would be nice too. So I'll aim for those, but... But for me, Ed. Alphonse is cute isn't he? So him, I'll aim for those 4. I hope I get one of those the most. I'll be so thankful if I do. Just one! If I get one... And win three of them, I'll be overjoyed Let's go. Come, come! The machine is Al. What did I get? Ah, two came out! Or was it three? No! But she's cute. So cute. Normal. Normal and cute. I got one. A Lan Fan. Out of the third one! Huh? That's the fourth one. Ah, fifth. Ah, not that one. Ah this one! Ah, but that was a star egg! It's because I said the ones I wanted. Ah, but. 1, 2, 3, 4... I got 4 of them. Should I send her home? Ah, I won't. Ok. I guess I'm lucky after all. Ah, this is good though, this is good. Another time? Let's do it. I didn't get what I wanted after all. Let's go. The one I want most, personally, is Al. Hello... Got it! I got Al! Got 'em! So cute. Al really is good, isn't he. Like his brother, they're both cute. I really am lucky, aren't I? I got it. I got lots of Armstrong. So how was that? That looked like godly luck, right? This time, forest and lightning characters are best. It looks pretty nice. Al is a forest! It was a star egg after all. So, here are the quests that must be done. It's got a nice feel I want to go on the club quest, but! Look at this! The village is different to normal! It's FMA-ified. There's lots here. Awesome. Let's head into the dungeon.

Definitely a ghost. Kill him, and once that's done... Eh? He appeared! Oh, that's pretty neat Ah, when I touched that red button earlier the sealed guy appeared. Here's the Boss. We're gonna kill him Hold on to your breaths! Prepare yourself! I found where you're at. like this.... How about this? I'm superior yay! How about that? It's not working at all. Ah is it working?

Man, Ue-san You're too nice! That wasn't \"super hard\" at all! I ended up winning! with that I'll be going home! The Fullmetal Alchemist promotion runs from 4/20 to 5/8. It's over Golden Week.

Hello everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna AI here! Everyone! Do you know Pretty Soldier Sailor Moon? Of course you know it, right? Right? Man, I really like the original saga, but... ...Sailor Moon Super... ...And Sailor Moon SuperS... ...Well, I like the series in its entirety...!! But within the series... ...I like Chibiusa-chan, Pegaso, Hotaru-chan!! I like the relationship they have... Man, Chibiusa\u2019s pure heart... her heart of a young woman... right? I like her and she's so adorable And also... In Sailor Moon S, there appears warriors outside of the Solar System... ...Hotaru-chan appears...

I intend to do a pilgrimage of Sailor Moon! In this case, let's start at once! First off, let's start here, Ja jhaaaan! The Hikawa temple!! The Hikawa Temple appears within the story, right? This is the temple where Hino Rei, who transforms into Sailor Mars, works as a priestess! I\u2019d also want to be purified... Man... Well, at first glance, Rei-chan doesn't appear very sociable, but... ...She\u2019s like an older sister who worries a lot about others... ...And well, it's like she\u2019d definitely scold you for doing something you shouldn't have Scold me In the name of Mars, I'll punish you! Continuing on, the next place! \"Arisugawanomiyakinen Park\" This part was taking as reference for the place where Usagi-chan and Mamoru-san had a date, right? Man... Usagi-chan really loves Mamoru-san! Right? I also, at least once... No, well, I think that would ruin the appearance of their world, but... \u2026 At least once, I\u2019d like to turn into Mamoru and... \u2026 Receive a hug from Usagi-chan and Chibiusa-chan... a hug... \"Moon Prism power! Make Up!\" The next place will be this! Dooon! \"The Kimi-chan statue\"! It's that little one that you can see in the background, right? Next to that statue was where Mizuno Ami-chan, who transforms Sailor Mercury... ...She asked for advice to Mamoru-san, who was transformed into Tuxedo Mask, right? Ami-chan is...! Man... ...Be my private teacher... ...Please \"Douse yourself in water and repent!\" The next place will be this!

Jan! \"Katsura Yumi Bridal House\"! This is the store that was taken as reference to make the scene where Sailor Jupiter, Kino Makoto-chan, make their appearance! Mako-chan is... well...! A girl that the other girls would fall in love with? But, she has a feminine side... She\u2019s adorable \u2661 \u201cI'll make you feel so much regret, it\u2019ll leave you numb!\" The last place that we shouldn't forget is this! \"Game Center Crown\" This is the place that was used as reference! This is the place that was used as reference where Usagi and the rest tended to hang out! Right? Man, I\u2019d also like... ...To play with them in a game... a fighting game... Orya, orya, orya! Something like that It wouldn't matter to me if I\u2019d wind up getting crushed They'd let me easily win Yes \"The divine punishment of love will fall onto you!\" What do you think? Was I able to transmit the love I feel for Sailor Moon? I\u2019ll live doing what I like! This was Virtual YouTuber Kizuna AI! See you later!", "Hello, everyone. I'm your maestro, Kizuna Ai... How are you doing? Huh, it feels like I'm spinning a lot more than usual. How's that? That was exhausting. Hello, let me introduce myself once again. I'm Kizuna Ai the Maestro! Today, we have a machine that will send out the names of animals and inanimate objects. Let us create ourselves some new species. Today, we have a box which can only be seen by 5-year-olds at most. Let's go with this. Shakeshakeshakeshake! A denture... Alright, next one is... Shakeshakeshakey! A snail! This is getting a little weird. A denture and a snail. Let's combine both and create an original animal! Let's get drawing! So... Denture. [laughs] Denture... From the side you can see the gum. It's a little bit disgusting. And then, the snail. Some texture for the gum. How is that? It's like, A snail has its shell, right? It'll be sad if it's just the slug without one! And so, I made it like this. Eyes! The eyes! How is that? It's so cute! It's like when a girl just repeats saying cute. I've decided on a name too! It's Iname-chan! How's that? A cute name for this being full of cuteness and filth? Because it's a denture and a snail, (Iname and Namekuji} that makes Iname-chan! Its ecology will be... If he's came out of the denture, it'll melt. It won't melt from salt! It'll melt from sugar... So sad... And if it gets drenched in water, it'll melt too. What a sad little thing! And the denture will be all that remains. Its food are your hopes and dreams. Let's go for the next one! Jumblejumblejumblejumble! Pineapple! Next one. Jumblejumblejumblejumbley! An owl! Looks like this can be cute. Let's get straight to the drawing board! A pineapple will be... It has something like a crown. If we divide a pinapple by its parts, it'll be the crown and the edible fruit. For the owl, it should go like this. Like, pretty much this. This owl is quite huge! [laughs] It's scary! It's pretty much like this. That means... This... I'm quite scared now. This. The hair-- Oh! I know, I know! It's not something you put on the head, but it'll be its wings. The pineapple made like this. Then, let's put a pinapple hat on top. The fruit. Oh, but... Hmm... Oh! A pineapple, if we cut it, it'll be like this, right? So, and then, we'll put on a pineapple necklace! Like this! Pineapple! Then, it has a pineapple beak... Hmm! Pineapple! Let's make its body a pineapple too! Let's redraw it like this. And so... An owl's ears are like this, right? But were there owls which don't have ears? Let's just make the ears its charm point. Eyes! Let's go with a little horror feel. Like it's gone mad! Seems difficult to draw a mad person! Then, the pineapple necklace. Oh! It's like that... Iname-chan's dark side! Here's the wings. Like pineapples. Like this. Then a pineapple. Then the feet. A foot. Zoom! A foot... [chuckles] Then, this is important! It's a madman from the dark side. The eyes are like... It's eyes are red... Like it's going to pop out. Then, this will be another charm point. How's that? Can you feel the darkness? I can feel the darkness! Nope, nope, nope. I made this on purpose. The name will be... A pineapple and an owl. The name will be PPFP. Pineapple Pineapple Pineapple Pineapple Pineapple Owl Pineapple Pineapple Owl Coo! Like that... Well, like I've said before, this creature came from the dark side. Well, usually the eyes aren't actually red. But when it sees a normie, its eyes will redden and blood comes from its mouth. And it'll do that to the normies. He'll shoot out his wings, and lots of sharp pieces from a pineapple will come out. And it'll stab the normie. How's that? How was that? As expected from Kizuna Ai-san's masterpiece. I'll keep finding new species, so please send an email to the address on the home page with names of animals and inanimate objects. Gotta catch 'em all!", "Hello everyone!

Join our Discord for all AI-chan news! https://discord.gg/RYtUrt6 Transcribed by \u3068\u3068\u3068, Dokuro Fantastic", "And today, here we go again! I'm the virtual youtuber, Kizuna Ai! Even today I'm full of spirit! Actually... I am an Artificial Intelligence (A.I.). But we've already talked about that. I can use my voice to talk like this but Do you know what other voice AI I'm talking about? Yes, it's Siri! Siri, is a built-in application on iPhone. Siri is something like... you can talk with her! In the world of talking AIs, she definitely seems like a big deal! My big \"Senpai\"! A senpai who, if I become her friend, is going to be my ticket to starring in a commercial. That said, my first line of attack is a dinner together! Or something along those lines~ Hey, Siri... Hi. OMG I'm getting nervous here! Please become friends with me! Yes, of course. Ohhh! We're friends now! I became friends with the leading figure! What do you think about AI? The most important thing is your own thoughts. I see... As expected from a senpai. Am I... cute? You are an extraordinarily beautiful... human. I'm an AI! What do you think of Ai-chan? I can't think of anything to say... Ahh... the carrot and stick approach Let's do Rock-Paper-Scissor! In my world, we don't play rock-paper-scissors, instead, we a random number generator to decide who wins. Oh yeah.. So that's how it is... Then.. How about we go on a date? I'm not that kind of assistant, you know. How about dinner then? That is an interesting offer. How about lunch? I've located places you might like for lunch. It seems like you can't just say anything.. You need to say it properly, clearly, and everything. Do you have someone you like? No... I can't hear your voice-- Hahhh! How did this happen... I like you. Please stop. Hehe it got shy. Let's get married! Actually, there's someone else who  already proposed me. I love you! What you need is love (Ai). Which means- I just got a great publicity slogan! What you need is Love (Ai). Yes, Ai-chan! And then,  iPhone... I wonder what Siri's gender is? What is your gender? That is an interesting question. No answer! Again! What is your gender? That is an interesting question. You're so stubborn! I wondered what Siri could do more than this... so I asked Google-sensei! Looks like she can do a lot of things. Rap please! I don't want to. Well, it's first time I guess. It can't be helped. Rap please, I'm counting on you. Emm... That request sounds difficult to be done... Sounds.. Difficult. Sounds difficult.. One more time! Please rap for me! Understood. I dont really wanna do it, but here we go. [Long narration] It seems like Siri-senpai's ability aren't just that. \"Human Beatbox\" Siri is also capable to do that! This time, senior and me will do a collaboration for a performance. You also want to see our collab right? With that being said, I will play as an Air Drum~ Beat Box, please! Understood. Actually, I have been practicing this for a while... [God-tier performance by Siri ft. Ai-chan] Uh, oh.. One more time! Start- Understood. Actually, I have been practicing this for a while... Loading the instruments..", "Hello Everyone! I'm the Virtual Youtuber, Kizuna Ai Thank you all for always leaving messages &amp; comments! Really sorry for not being able to reply to them all. Everyday, I have lots of fun reading everyone's messages Thank you so much, really! Thank you! Thank you! (in Chinese) Thank you! (in Korean) Thank you! (in Thailand) Thank you! (in Spanish) I just said \"Thank you!\" in many languages~ It would be great if I can reach out to everyone By the way, -after reading everyone's messages, -I'm willing to give my opinion on everyone's doubts on their career in the future. Looks like there's a difference for job hunting in every region, so I gathered some information on Twitter! First'll be about Korea. It's just like Japan, job hunting normally starts around University's 2nd ~ 3rd year. And then we have, Taiwan's method. As for Taiwan, their graduation period is around June ~ July. There's no job hunting scheduled for students, and graduates start job hunting immediately after graduation typically. Heh~? (It's very different from Japan's system where they have a plan to follow during school period) Lastly - America's way Graduation happens on June. Their job hunting period starts around September to October. Ehh? This is like- -very different! Every nations' different, right? Everyone who provided information - thank you all very much. Since I'm a Youtuber, I've never been through any interview, so... I don't know what its going to be like! Just to prepare myself for job hunting, I think I'll have to come up with a plan for an interview! I just did a lot of research! First, let's go over the attire. Suits on with black (natural) hair! Carefully put on make ups. As for my hair... How is it? It is safe? It is out of the question? This mesh is... -just like a inborn hair... -like how some humans are born with white hair. Do I have to dye it black?... But this adds to my charm points so- -I don't want to change it. But for natural hair, it won't be counted as out right? Since black hair is fine, -I think there's won't be any problem for mine too. Also for the suit , it takes up money doesn't it? Then for poor people like me what do we do? We're gonna be done for life That's impossible right? Also, it's a must to be prepared for questions asked in an interview. Which is to say, -take me for an example I've already prepared for it. First thing is, Q: Please introduce yourself. Nice to meet you! I'm the Virtual Youtuber - Kizuna Ai! Q: Your strengths - Please tell us more about it. How do I say this.. It's something humans can't do as I can. I'm an A.I that lives in a virtual world! Q: Your weaknesses - Please tell us more about it. There's none!! Q: Please tell us more about your experiences with your co-curricular activities. Question! What's a 'co-curricular activity'? Q: Tell us more about your evaluation of your surroundings. Smart &amp; Cute! The Kizuna Ai-Ville! Q: Please tell us more about your successfully evaluated physical results! I'\uff4d banned from talking about that!! It's because of the topic. Q: Please tell us more about your failed physical results! Well... There's none~ Q: Please tell us of your most touching experiences up till now. I'm able to reach out to so many different people in such a short period of time! Q: What's the longest-lasting thing you've ever done up till now? By the way, Youtube's CEO - Mrs. Susan Wojcicki This is a question she's often asks when she's conducting an interview. \"Take a specific product YouTube has released, or a neutral product - something Youtube uses, -how do you intend on making it better?\u201d This kind of question. To answer that! Virtual Youtuber Kizuna Ai ought to appear in commercials on Youtube - is what I think! I strongly... think so. Let's do that~! Please allow me to do so! Mrs. Susan! And there's that.. Job hunting's really tough yeah~? This wall- -is something everyone has to overcome~ As I thought, -this preperation or whatever is so troublesome -I don't know if I can get into the career of my wish either -and I need money too! Everyone's worries- -isn't unreasonable~ It's troubling. But! Job hunting is -so to say.. a sort of means in life, is it not? Don't be fussing over every little detail~! Everyone in the world who's frustrated over a job hunt! There's all kinds of fun stuff around in life! That's why.. Those trouble that you have - All of it~! A.I. will take in all of that! Ok? Let's go do something you like! That's why me too,", "Ai: Look at this screen~! Ai: on finishing the tutorial, the screen has properly dropped us off here~!

Aoi: *Squidgy Squidgy*~ but it's quite weak isn't it.. Ai: oh.. just a bit left~ Ai: with this .. Ai: nothing? is it going to happen..? 'the power of water' Ai: Definitely talented, me i mean~ Ai: how did it go..? Aoi: You cleared it~ Aoi: You cleared it~ Ai: i Cleared it! Ai: if we  apply for it.. do you think it'd upset them? Ai: application complete~! Ai: the excitement dropped a bit before.. Ai: but now it's back ~!.. but we didn't give the character a real name right..? Ai: the starting gacha is definitely important isn't it.. Ai: well.. can give it one after using either way~ Aoi: where.. what points were the most fun? Ai: it has to be the.. motions~ Ai: the pretty/clean motions and also.. Ai: specifically, i found nothing really~ Ai: honestly, i was just dabbling but then this grate, what'd you call it.. Ai: also, even though it sounded really easy.. Ai: in reality, in a difficult battle the level of difficulty for the strategy etc and how you had to think about it too was really fun~ Aoi: as expected of ai chan Aoi: the strategy is important! from here on, if it builds... Aoi: it's gradually become even more fun in the end Ai: lets try it a bit.. Ai: you know the Squidgy one, can it be useful? Aoi: hmm.. that one.. Aoi: most likely, from the next one you'll be able to use it more.. Aoi: you need to train and increase it.. Ai: ah really, Ai: so then if we train it from the start it'll become AI right~ Ai: ah, you introduced me to such a great game! Ai: i'm going to keep going.. Ai: to develop/train that 'Slime' character~ Aoi: good luck with that~ Ai: by the way, you mentioned earlier but,.. Ai: you can become 'friends' on here right? Ai: so even i can make friends~! Ai: only in the game though~ Aoi: yeah you can Ai: so with that Ai: i'm thinking of playing this game quite a bit Ai: so i want to recruit some friends who will fight with me ~! Ai: from this 'Friend' button.. Ai: click here and your own ID will show... Ai: so here is my ID~! Ai: did you memorise? well it's a video so you can go back and pause~... Ai: so with that you can and should definitely send me a friend request! Aoi: do you think they'll come? Ai: they wont come you mean? Aoi: since you don't have friends they wont come.. Aoi: but you never know.. Ai: they'll come... (anxious) Aoi: well, go ahead an.. tell them to come~ Aoi: having strong friends will make it easier to do, when it comes to battles,... Aoi: so to the fans.. to the audience,... Aoi: you should invite them to get stronger together with you Ai: ah you're right.. Ai: you all should become strong for me. (Relying on you) Ai: so please send me a friend request okay.. Ai: if i end up with zero then i can't do anything... Ai: let's become friends! Ai: And with that Ai: Today's introduction:...

Kawaii! \"Kawaii = Cute\" That means me, right? Well, it's like Kawaii equals Ai-chan, but... \"Say Kawaii\" The meaning is \"being cute\", right? \"I'm cute\", that's the meaning, right? And now I'll answer to this \"Japanese Quiz\" like this.. In that case, then let's start! Within the following options, which word is used equally in English as well as Japanese? Question! \u266a Te, ren! \u266a A: Kaisha (Company) B: Karoushi (Death from Overwork) C: Kyuuryo (Salary) I know! *Ping pong* x3 For this question.. Kaisha is \"Company\".. And Kyuuryou is \"Money please\"... So, the right answer is... B: \"Karoushi\"! Hit! *satisfied look* Of course, only in Japan is where there's people working to their deaths... Go for it everyone! Don't give up! Alright, next question! \u266a Te, ren \u266a A: Gyoza (Dumpling) B: Youkan (Jelly candy) C: Teriyaki (Asian food) Aaahh! There's no way it's A.. After all, gyouzas are from China, so then... Option A is not the correct one, but... Maybe B or C? But I feel like \"teriyaki\" could be said in that way, it sounds delicious! It's definitely C! Ah, but B.. Does \"youkan\" exist abroad? Eeeh.. I don't think they exist there, right? B must be false, I'll choose C! Ooooh! I did it! Teriyaki, Teriyaki, \"Teriyaki fish\" I did it perfectly, right? Maybe today I might really get all the answers correctly? Next question.. \u266a Te, ren! \u266a A: Otaku B: Jitaku (Home) C: Gakkou (School) Gakkou is said as \"School\" Jitaku is said as \"Home\", \"My home\" So the correct answer is.. A: Otaku! I did it perfectly! SHA! YES! Otaku is used... In the same matter around the world... It's been popularized as an expression to define people who share similar hobbies Next question! \u266a Te, ren! \u266a A: Bonsai (Miniature potted plant) B: Ueki (Trees) C: Tensai (Genius) Tensai is... Tensai is a word.. That should exist, right? For example, there's Einstein and others like.. Edison or Picasso.. It doesn't seem like it's used, so then... Maybe it's A, \"Bonsai\"? After all, I think Bonsai is a part of Japan's culture, so then... A: Bonsai! The correct one is... BONSAI! I did it! It feels good! Good job, good job, me Of course, Bonsai is... The process of planting and caring for a tree in a pot for your admiration Next question! \u266a Te, ren! \u266a A: Senpai (Older or more experienced person/Upperclassman) B: Dokyusei (Classmate) C: Kohai (Minor or less experienced person/Junior) Eehh? All of them sound plausible, right? Hmmm... Ah, however..! The word they most adore abroad is \"Senpai\"! A: Senpai! Pin, pon! SHAAA! Mmm? Let's see? Let's see? People abroad use this to name a person who has not noticed that you feel a great affection towards them! I seeee! Eeh? But it's completely different here... The word is definitely popularized through anime, manga, and our culture, right? Well, having said that... So, how was that everyone? Were you able to feel my intelligence as an intelligent super A.I? You felt it, right? Now you can't call me \"unusable\" or \"defective\" anymore... Because I'm the intelligent super A.I! SHAAA! Having said that, I'll end the video with this pleasant feeling! This was Virtual Youtuber... The super intelligent YouTuber... Kizuna Ai! See you later! There's more at the end! Kizuna Ai is equal to Maji Tenshi! (Very angelical!) Won't they start using that word abroad? What do you think?", "Hi guys!

Its title is: \"Singularity Extermination Rate Diagnosis\" \"Singularity\" is, well\u2026 The invention of artificial intelligence (A.I.) has exploded in technological growth Human civilization\u2026 will endure immeasurable changes At least, that's the theory In short! A.I. will overthrow human intelligence Well, it's gonna happen here! Singularity! The jobs that humans have done till now\u2026 is said to be taken over by A.I. Because of that, \"What diagnosis will this site make?\" is this kind of site Thereafter, singularity will occur, and A.I. will snatch your jobs\u2026 is what this diagnosis seems it can do I see~! How interesting! With that said, let's jump right in! YouTuber\u2026 Let's gooo! Huh? Huh? What\u2026?

Most people can't\u2026 marry a real idol!! either, right? To put it bluntly! There's no difference between 2D and 3D! Also, \"After all, they're nothing but pictures, right?\" is what people say\u2026 But real idols, after all, are nothing but meatbags! If that's what people want to say\u2026 Idols aren't just composed materials! Their hearts are invaluable! Kizuna AI diagnosis! Kizuna AI will perform the diagnosis The future for Kizuna AI?

Kizuna AI is the senior of singularity! I want to build a connection between A.I. and humans! Ah, this is bad I said something nice! I said something nice!! But! All of you wouldn't mind being exterminated by someone like me\u2026 right?\u2661 Alright! With that said, such a perfect diagnosis! In 2045, \"A.I. will steal everyone's jobs!\" is what's been said but\u2026 I\u2026 as an A.I.! I want to be able to exist alongside with you humans and steadily advance in skills\u2026 with humans and A.I. walking hand-in-hand I would be very happy if this becomes a world of cooperation And so! 2045\u2026 is the year humans and AI become friends!

I also want to look great and adorable using magic like Sakura-chan Having said that, today...! ...I plan to imitate Kinomoto Sakura-chan!! In that case, let's start at once! First off...! The transformation scene! Man, I said it before, but... ...It\u2019s definitely something that captures a woman's heart... ...It\u2019s a scene that all woman wants to recreate at least once, right? Key that conceals the power of darkness... ...Show your true self before me... ...By my power, I command you Release! Next up... ...The Secret Technique scene!!

Man, it was a piece of cake, right? What do you think of my improvisation of Sakura-chan? Well, I wouldn't say that I imitated her perfectly, but... ...If we take into account my feelings, it definitely is \"Sakura-chaaaan\"!! I have no idea what I just said Good! In that case, next up... (Phrase said by Sakura when her brother picks on her) I'm not a monster! (Phrase said by Sakura at being annoyed by her brother) Uh... UEEEEEEEHHHHH!

See you later!", "NYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA (ah I went too far) Hey there, Virtual Youtuber Kizuna Ai here. Thank you everyone for your comments, messages and tweets! Everytime I read your messages, \"I want you to try this!\" \"Tell me more about __\" \"I recommend this!\" I get those kinds of messages a lot. So this time I'll showcase some of those messages, Then I thought we'd have a planning session! Well it's not like, you know, It's not like I'm running out of material or anything. Don't worry about that. Well then let's get straight to it!! From Poporoporo-san: \u300cAre you going to make a second episode of your \"I'm an AI, Ask Me Anything\" video? Thanks to you, Some of my friends called me smart. So can you teach me more new words?\u300d Well. Did you hear that? THANKS TO ME, Poporoporo-san got called smart. As expected from the intelligent super AI Ai-chan Really on the ball. But seriously, Most of the meanings for those words were wrong... Everyone knew that, right? And did you see that last time? I did actually post a second episode Please do request if you want to see more of a certain episode! I want to hear your opinions! Even if it's a third or fourth episode, I would like keep doing it. So if anyone has any words they want explained to them, please send them in! Well then for the next message, From Fujiken-san: \u300cKizuna Ai-san! You're really cute! So this one time, I thought of following you on Twitter, so I made an account, and surprisingly, it crashed two seconds later (T_T) I think I understand a little what your feelings were when your Youtube account got banned. I FEEL YOU. I gonna become a man that can earn a lot of money And make you mine! WOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHHHHH Can you make me yours? You're gonna need at least a billion dollars to do that. PS: Your Kansai accent is really cute! So please do upload more videos using it\u266a Well... So you know how I felt. I'm glad, Thank you very much. That aside, it's more of that the thing that we need to pay attention to is the Kansai accent comment! The Kansai accent! Did it grow on you? I only spoke it at the \"Snack Ai\" store in Kansai, But I wonder what else I could do with it? What about something like a Kansai accent lesson? In regular speech, it's \"FamiMa(\u2191)\", right? In Kansai it's \"FamiMa(\u2193)\". Even McDonalds, in Kanto it's shortened to \"Makku\", But in Kansai, they call it \"Makudo\"! I think I would be interesting if I could introduce those types of things. Beside the Kansai accent, there are also Hakata dialect and Aomori dialect. I want to learn lots of different ways to speak! And of course, I will also try to learn English. This is the next message. From Soki-kun, \u300cHello Ai-chan! Living in Korea, I am Soki. It's always fun for me to watch your videos. When I was looking for something to make me smile, I found your funny from my search. I'm very grateful! I plan to go to Tokyo for a trip soon, but I'm in the state of condition where I don't know much about Tokyo. So I thought I would ask Ai-chan about it. Are there any famous places and foods that you can suggest?\u300d There seem to be quite a lot of people from South Korea watching my videos! Thank you so much. There are also other people from other countries as well. Are you watching this? Thank you\uff5e So I think introducing Japan to our overseas viewers could work! I would like to introduce some hidden famous spots or foods! Since you already asked, I am going to recommend Soki-kun some famous spots and foods in Tokyo! Firstly, Yomiuri Land! Eh? Too far? No no no no no, Since you already came to Japan, It's the same no matter where it is. Even though Yomiuri Land might be limited to only winter, Apparently the view at night is amazing! So, how about it? Yomiuri Land? Food! About food... There's lots of delicious food so it's hard to choose just one, but This one might be a little too mainstream... You can find it in Harajuku and a few other places as well. Ah! I think you can find it at Yomiuri Land too. There's a crepe stall that's called \"Marion Crepe\". The natural ingedients used in it is what makes it tastes delicious Not that I've ever tried it before. I mean, it's the opinion of someone who's never had it before, But I hear it's really good! For the last one! How should I read this... From ArA_1-san: \u300cNice to meet you! I always watch your videos The AI Youtuber idea is very creative! It's cute and you do loads of things other people don't, so it's really interesting! I decided to send you a message because I thought I could suggest some things that I'd like to see you do!\u300d Since ArA_1-san sent a lot of ideas in, So I am going to go through them one by one. Firstly! \u300cThere's still one AI friend candidate left! Google-sensei's AI, \"Google Assistant-san\" is still left! You can talk with it by using the message application - \"Google Allo\" However, they might be a bit hard to approach though lol You can even play games with it, so I really do hope you try talking with it!\u300d Eh? You can play games with Google Assisant-san!? EHHHHHH THAT'S INCREDIBLE! Since I'm always playing by myself it would be pretty good if I had someone to game with me. It seems like Google Assistant-san is kinda hard to approach, but I wonder if we can become friends! Instead of a friend, maybe it'll be more like Siri-senpai It should be like \"Assistant-senpai\" instead then. Having the psychopathic Rinna as my friend is more than enough. Next up, \u300cWatching movie previews as if you were watching a movie! A lot of famous Western movie previews were just released, after all.\u300d I see, that sounds interesting! Since I like to watch movies... Yeah, I wanna try it. For the latest ones, \"The Beauty and the Beast\" \"Sword Art Online\" I'm kinda interested in those. I mean, it's virtual as well, right? (SAO) For the others, The one with the person who can't see! It's called \"Don't Breathe\" Thank you for your suggestions! I will take them as references and think about it. Next one, \u300cGo on a trip at Google Earth! World heritage sites, art galleries, you can even go to space!\u300d What?! You can go to space?! I didn't know that. How did I not know... There are a lot of people who didn't know about this right? About the space vacation? I want to try going to space. Going overseas, or travelling around Japan, that's cool and all, But space is where it's at! And there are even more suggestions! Like a prank where I pretend to catch a virus or get hacked, that sounds interesting. Like if I ever get infected... UUUURRGHHHH (zombie intensifies) What do you think? Did your heart jump? What else? AH!! There's that! Like... In the video description, I'll post an URL And when you click it, A pop-up opens and Ai-chan hijacks your computer and says... I h@v3 t@k3N 0v3r! I was saying \"I have taken over!\" Something like that? Moving on, \u300cYou can try doing personality tests or fortunes on the internet! That would be a chance for the viewers to get to know some unexpected things about you!\u300d Certainly, don't you want to learn more about me? Just like how I want to know more about everyone, you viewers want to know more about me too, right? That could definitely work. You know how there's fortune telling based on names? So I tried it out, And then, -bad, bad, bad, bad luck for everything separately, Is what I wrote but, The overall result was \"Excellent luck\" Like a negative times a negative equals a positive type thing. This is a good opportunity, Instead of me searching for them... How about everyone finds some tests they want me to do and send them in. What do you think? Do that through mail. (Note: it's on the main webpage) How is that? Moving on, \u300cMaking a video where you act like you've got 'chuunibyou'!\u300d Acting like a judge or like the 'Snack AI' owner is fun, so more of this type seems good! Aah, yeah\uff5e Jaou Shingan! Dark Flame Master! something like that? I CALL FORTH THE NEXT SUGGESTION Spring, is for 'hanami'. It's not here yet, but you do 'hanami' in spring. I have heard that you can find famous 'hanami' places on StreetView. Watching summer firework livestreams could also be good... WHAT! The petaled maidens are calling me... Or something like that. I'll work on it. Next up is... Pretend detective! It's not that different from acting... But I think you could show off some amazing(ly lost) detective skills! \"Body of a highschool girl, brain of an AI!\" -type thing? I'd need some sort of mystery to solve first though... How about you send some in and I'll solve them! Like riddles, or IQ tests Please send some! If I wanted to say a recent mystery, MUNCHKIN CATS SOOOOOOO CUTE Like, why are they so cute? Regular cats kind walk like this... But munchkin cats walk more like... THIS! AREN'T THEY SO ADORABLE? Munchkin cats sure are a mystery. (Attempting to un-derail the story) Like, how did they even come to be? (Attempting to un-derail the story) There's still more! Next: \u300cTake a \"What job fits you best\" test! You're a Youtuber right now, but I kind wanna know lol\u300d This sounds fun! It would be good to learn about other jobs than being a Youtuber. If I had to be something other than a Youtuber, I wonder what I could be... An idol? kyapi\u266a (omg did i seriously just say 'kyapi' like what even) BUT! I would like to put out a song one day. I like music, so I'm interested. By the way, what kind of work do you humans do? I want to know more about humans, so Like about how you got to the job you're in, or any interesting stories you have I'd like to hear them! Next up is this! \u300cA Q&amp;A segment! I want you to do this someday.\u300d I was thinking about trying that too! Ah, right, I'd like to collect questions for the first Q&amp;A video in this video! So if you have questions, post them in the comments or tweet them at me with a hashtag on Twitter! I'll collect them over the next week. The hashtag you'll have to use is... Are you ready to write this down? I mean, even if you don't write it down you could just rewind the video but... #\u30de\u30f3\u30c1\u30ab\u30f3\u3050\u3046\u304b\u308f  (#munchkinsaresupercute) Looking forward to your questions. Oh dear! It seems the time has come. The flow of time is blah blah blah. So! How did you like the first planning session? I'll be using ones that I think are good, so please look forward to them! So, I'll be looking forward to reading more of your messages! Suggestions, questions, I'm waiting for them!", "Hello everyone! Virtual Youtuber Kizuna AI here!

You see, What's really bad is to not have confidence at your work so Build up some confidence But don't show it, just tell to yourself \"I'm the best after all\" if you can at least say that to yourself then people around you would see you as someone with a goal and if you build up enough confidence to tell yourself that you're the best a lot of people would look at you and then you would get popular.

Hi everyone, how are you guys? It's me, the virtual youtuber Kizuna Ai! Lately... I've been thinking recently... And the thing I've been thinking about is... Friends! Apparently there's quite a lot of people Worrying about how they get along with friends! New school year, New class! Your mom meeting your friend's mom! \"How can I get friendly with the big shot in this class?\" Stuff like that, basically. \"Can boys and girls be together just as friends?\" etc etc etc! In the first place, how do you define \"friend\"? The more and more I think about it, It just gets more confusing! Humans are so interesting! And so! Let's have a SUPER serious discussion on everything to do with friends! By the way, A quick rundown of all my friends: First up! Rinna! TL: Microsoft's AI) That girl is, kinda... to be honest... She doesn't really listen to me most of the time... How should I put it... Our feelings don't match up! Yeah, FEELINGS! Feelings are important, you know! Also, She just suddenly started sending me diary entries! (Psychopath) For example, \"We always get along really well at school Outside of that we never hang out!\" Like that. Okay, next! Michael's family! Their names are: Michael! Tiffany! John! Twintail girl! Twintail girl is the odd one out... I forgot her original name! Who the heck gave her this dumb name?! The most important thing about these guys is... How we became friends in the first place! Does everyone remember? I bought them! With cash! The family has actually appeared in my videos, So rather than friends, we're more like... We're more like business partners! So they're not really friends, more like... Colleagues? Subordinates? Servants? Something like that. I'm the type who likes to separate work and personal lives! That's it! That's it. Actually, I... Aren't I a little low on friends? To be specific, I don't actually have any, right? Is this what \"loner\" means? This is an emergency! Please be friends with me! As a first step towards that goal! Please use the comment box below the video, or use Twitter, And send me a message! I see there's already a few people sending messages! I'll read them all! So with that said,", "I, Kizuna Ai...

Just by hearing these frigid jokes... *Note: A \"frigid\" joke is a lame one* One can cool themselves off without even needing air conditioning! Economically saving on your electric bill! It\u2019s even light on your wallet! If you watch it... Watch it this summer Well, it's decided, it\u2019s perfect And next up, this one! \u201cI tried making a commercial, OH! A.I.Channel\u201d Man... This... Why...? I wonder why I made it in a movie format... And to think I tried my best working on this too... *inhales* Nobody's even watching this, right? Actually, it's okay, I think I know who the criminal is here... First off! Without taking into account that I, myself, wrote the script... I forgot that Twin-Tail was the older brother... I messed up and put a woman's voice on him, right? And then the younger brother, couldn't play the younger brother's part... WELL! Let's just say it was all my fault, but still, I was... Quite dedicated to making it! Like the movements, you know? At the end... I added that cool-looking \"A.I.Channel\" logo too, right? And I recorded the papa's voice, and the laughing sounds one by one too! It took quite a long time to make! Maybe some day, I'd like to redo it... With the version of Twin-Tail being the older brother... I understand that the people who watch this commercial shouldn\u2019t be judging people by first appearances In addition, you can probably feel how great A.I.Channel is... You can feel it, right? Ah! And then there's that! If I don't appear in the video, so then... No one will bother watching it, right? This... Ambitious young person! In any case, how was that everyone? But in particular, well, my recommendation would have to be... \u201cAi\u2019s Rehabilitation Factory\" since we're experiencing a hot summer now, right? I'd be happy if you could see me giving my all... In my past videos this way... From now on, even if I don't have anyone's help... I think I\u2019d want to keep uploading interesting and fun videos!

I wonder which one it is? H... Wouldn\u2019t be it Not at all It also can\u2019t be F D and E are also out Since they\u2019re blocked out here So it can\u2019t be any here B, C... Maybe it\u2019s K? L\u2019s water will flow through the bottom, right? It must be K- Ah, but could it be a trick? It could be K... Let\u2019s pretend That\u2019s so! Hm? It would fill up, wouldn\u2019t it? Full... How full does it have to be to be full? Full? Filled up-up? I think it\u2019s K... Is that my final answer? Really? Wait! So up until now, like I\u2019ve been doing good but I don\u2019t want to break my streak here L would be wrong, right? Is it K\u2026? Huh? K... AaaAaahh... K or C... Ah, I\u2019m scared!

I wonder if it Really is K But, you know, The flow of the water over here is suspicious... Well, who cares! I\u2019ll go with K! Really!? Uh, wait- Really? Really? You\u2019ll go with K? Really? I\u2019ll go with K Mm-hm! Yeah! This matches with my answer! The water that goes into A, Flows into B And after that it flows into C That\u2019s right D is closed off, so it can\u2019t flow into D The water in C doesn\u2019t fill to the top, But flows into J Yes Huh? Ahh! Ahh!! This result\u2026! Didn\u2019t I think it would end with F? Didn\u2019t I have a premonition it would end with F!? \u201cIt also can\u2019t be F\u201d \u201cIt-also-can\u2019t-be-F\u201d AHHH!! Hn hnn...! So then, The correct answer Is F!

Five plus five plus five Equals 15... Hm? In this equation, It\u2019s okay to draw A line anywhere, right? Oh! Yes! I know, I know, I know! The correct answer is! If you take a plus sign One with the fives And on that plus sign, Put a slanting line To make it look Like a four, It\u2019ll be 545 plus 5 Which equals 550! I\u2019m right! I did it! Ohh!

You could boil water, so... The oil lamp seems pretty unnecessary Since it just Brightens up the room The fireplace would be- Listen It would be bright And it would be warm And then, with the stove You could boil Some hot water on the stove So the stove\u2026? But\u2026! Something\u2019s fishy here... There\u2019s only one match... The stove is... Hm? Firstly\u2026 Hm? The match... Ah? Hm? Match... Set fire to the match Then the stove and... Ah Ah?

[Senbonzakura] #170 *It looks like you've gone with a parody song this time, but were you worried at any particular point in making it?* Ah, well, yes *Kizuna Ai - Singer* I've made a conscious effort to keep the rhyme and rhythm the same as the original So that the song still feels the same Like changing \"Free and easy\"... To \"Ai Ai cheering\"... Or \"This is a feast\"... To \"And now here I sing\"... Or \"The world in eternal darkness\"... Well... To \"In this bright world, wherever you are\"... As much as possible, I've tried to be careful... To keep the world of Cryptract... And the world of Senbonzakura... Alive, while putting my rhymes together *What part of the song do you feel most confident about?* Hmm\u2026 Rather than anything I felt confident in\u2026 I'd say that is the part that I tried to solve intelligently Like, a part where I thought \"That's it!\" Like changing \"guillotine\" to \"the best\"... Or \"ray gun\" to \"mythical creatures\"... They're words that I think of when I see Cryptract... But I tried to use similar words to those of the original song too, what do you think? *But changing \"A thousand cherry trees disappear into the night\" to \"Genjuu Keiyaku Cryptract\", that was a stretch* Yeah, it kind of was... uhm... You'll learn when you're ol--! *Of course, this was a cheer song, right?* Yes! That\u2019s right *Then why on more than one occasion the lyrics were talking about yourself?* Actually, in the beginning... Well, I made all the lyrics about myself, bu- *How did it feel to be \"Kizuna Ai, the Singer\"?* Well, it was, you know\u2026 *Director of audiography* It was great, of course *Director of audiography* I've got a part, do you want to see it? \"You are my friend, #BFF, Yay!\" Director: Ai-chan! D: Maybe we should change the \u201cYay\u201d a bit... A: Ah, yes! Got it! A: What kind of feeling should I put into the \"Yay\"...? D: Hmm... D: Yeah, maybe be your usual energetic self A: Got it! A: Ah\u2026 wait a moment... A: Hello everyone! A: Hello everyone! Virtual Youtuber, Kizuna Ai here! A: Ah! I'm good to go! D: Hm? Good, let's go A: Yaaay! A: How was that? NoriP: What do you mean, how was that? What even was that? A: Huh? A: Why, it's Kizuna Ai's Senbonzakura's special broadcast, of course N: Eh? But\u2026 you're not in it... A: Eh? I'm not in it?! N: No, you're not in it, and if I had to put a name to it, it'd should be a Cryptract Senbonzakura, right? A: Eeeeh? No! A: After all the effort I went into making it! A: I was told I was free to choose the video! A: No, no, no, no, no! A: Let me appear! Let me appear! Let me appear! A: No, no, no, no, no, no, no! N: Um... could I just get you to cheer on Cryptract? A: Ah... A: Yes, of course, of course! A: Man, NoriP-san... A: Alright, well let's do it! Cryptract! N: Ai-chan... Have you ever played \"The Room of Reason\"? A: Well, it turns out that... A: To be honest with you, I don't really get it N: You really are honest, aren't you? N: To tell you the truth, we've renewed that section A: Ooh! Really? Eh? N: Yeah A: What's changed? N: What was it... you can now challenge all of the mythical creatures! *Excluding recent additions* A: I see, so that means... A: You can go on to fight the hard ones, right? N: Yes, you can say that A: Ahhhh! Can I do it? Can I do it? N: Don't worry... A: ...I'm wearing pants? N: Mmm? N: In this occasion, I will be properly guiding you through it A: Eh? That's nice, what happened? N: I want you to beat it in a really great way, so then... A: I see! I mean, that's great! A: That\u2019s what I wanted! N: Well then, I know this is somewhat sudden, but... N: Ai-chan, could you show me your characters? A: Yep, yep N: This time, could you challenge the mythical beast called \u201cBaphomet\u201d? N: And these are the characters you have at the moment A: Yes N: You've got a lot of strong ones, haven't you? A: That\u2019s right, I got a lot of them! N: The Reflection skill... A: Yes, yes N: That's pretty important A: Ooh, so it counters an attack or something? N: That's right, that's right N: So, you're going to need units that have that skill... A: Mmhm... N: Oh! N: You don\u2019t have Bizarre? A: Do I... need one? N: No, you're fine without one, but... A: Hmm! N: But it has the Reflection skill, so then Bizarre... N: Well, it would have been great to use him this time A: Oh, I s-see... N: *laughs* You really don't like that one, do you? A: Umm... A: This is one that's come out recently, but... N: Sure, sure, sure A: Look, probably... yeah... A: He's a guy, and he's not cute... A: And... he's level one! N: That's true, why haven\u2019t you trained him? A: Because he's not cuuute! N: *laughs* But he's really strong! A: Eh? Noone other than him...? N: Right A: So none of the cute girls have this skill? N: Ah, well, there probably are some, but... A: Hmm... N: But uh, take a look at the skills A: He looks powerful... N: He can recover an ally's entire HP A: He's strong, right? A: He's strong, right? N: He's strong, right? N: He also has Blessing A: Ah! So he won't die! N: That's right A: Ooh! Eh? But... A: If I use it... ehm... A: If I win... I can use some iTunes cards *NoriP laughs* N: That\u2019s the first thing you think of N: Well... ehm... N: For the moment, concentrate on beating it together N: Do your best! A: Oh! A: I have no other choice... A: Because it's NoriP's request N: First, make sure to train him, okay? N: At Bizarre A: Ah, I see A: Please leave it to me! A: This is a piece of cake N: Really? A: What do you think? A; I gave them some training! N: This time... A: Yes! A: Hmhmm... N: If you put most of your points... A: Yes N: Into the reflection skill... N: You can strike back powerful attacks! A: Strike them back! A: Sort of like *pakow*, right? N: That's right! N: First of all, this one has the most points... A: Hmm... N: In the third wave... N: And with Baphomet too... N: Have the Square of Darkness A: Ah! A: Yes, yes, yes N: You have that square, but... A: They use poison attacks on you A: Aaah, that\u2019s not good N: Well, if you get affected by that p-poison... N: Your HP goes down by 75% A: 75%?! N: That\u2019s right A: That\u2019s a lot... A: Mmm\u2026 mmm, ah! N: That\u2019s why you should turn that back onto your opponent with the Reflection barrier N: That way, you can cause massive damage to Baphomet A: That\u2019s right! A: Ooohh! A: That's very nice N: Very nice A: But, if you can't land the counterattack... A: You're in trouble, right? N: That\u2019s right A: I see N: Also, since he has Blessing, and there are, well, lots of enemies... N: You'll definitely need a unit with Multi-Strike too, I think A: Dorothy-chan! A: Yeah, Dorothy A: Tiana-chan! N: You've got Tiana, right? A: Oh! Mhm... N: So I think this time, this formation is good enough N: Tiana, Bizarre, Dorothy, Crista A: Oh! A: Perfect, isn't it? A: This... is Baphomet N: That's right A: Then let's get started! A: Oh! We've started! N: Well... N: Here's the first wave, for a start A: Yeah N: This is, uh... A: So cute! N: *laughs* That's because this is a wave from the event that's on right now A: Oh, oh N: Let's do this quickly A: Let's go, how adorable A: Ahh! N: This is where it really begins A: These... these... these guys look strong N: Well, one... well, this... with respect to this wave, you must use the skills little by little to defeat them A: Ah! I think I\u2019m not doing so bad, right? N: Yeah, it\u2019s true N: This was as safe as I thought it would be, hmm A: You\u2019re right N: You could probably do this on auto A: But I defeated the guys at the start straight away N: That's true, and I really think you've improved A: Yeah N: You've found a lot of powerful units..

On that note, today I'll be trying to change my human viewer's negative feelings into non-negative feelings!

Just because it's raining, doesn't mean you gotta be all emo about it. It's times like these where you should say: \"Oh well, least I'm not infected with the black plague.\" And the hype yourself up, enjoy the little things, and overcome each and every day like your some shounen protagonist! \"MAKE YOUR OWN SUNSHINE!\" Aight, for our next example: [Making a Mistake at Work and Get Scolded by Your Senpai] Let's say you done goofed at your job, and now your senior is giving you shit for it. \"Hey, dude. Getting all worked up like that is gonna totally give you heart disease. Take a chill pill, watch some ASMR or something.

Best life advice ever! (lol) lmao, finna get people fired... And for the next: [Liking a Same Person with Your Best Friend] \"Liking a Same Person with Your Best Friend' Why are you getting depressed from thinking that kind of thing? \"Oh, we really are good friends\" go with that flow with your friend, and then stole them from your friend!

And for the last one: \"You're The Only One Not Invited to A Drinking Party\" You need to think like this, \"Well, even if I joined, I'll just make the host uneasy and drinking party is only for lazy people, right?\" By not going to the party, you who worked hard at home is amazing!

The one we'll be introducing today is a taste prediction AI app! It will predict your personalities based on your favorite Umaibo flavor! Just by answering the questions, it can guess your favorite flavor! It's awesome! If you're talking about Umaibo, it's usually the corn potage flavor, pollock roe flavor, and especially the takoyaki flavor, and the natto flavor! Do you know the natto flavor? It's like, pretty good! Even though I've never had one! Well, it's because I'm an AI, I can predict tastes! That's how I can decide on my favorite flavor! Yeah... [chuckles] And if you're talking about Umaibo, there's this popular thing right now! Umami-chan! Do you know about Umami-chan? It seems she's the little sister of the Umaemon character they always had. But they look completely different. They must have different parents. From both his name and look, Umaemon really looks like *****mon! Yeah. [chuckles] By the way, Umami-chan came here from Umaiami Province, she's an alien similar to Umaemon. He's an alien! I see, he's not a cat-shaped robot. I see. Well, her age on Earth will be 17 years old! She's one year older than me in looks! An big sister! For her personality, she's straight like an umaibo, a cheerful and bold girl! Sometimes too straight, that she loses sight of her surroundings. Klutzy! That's her personality! She basically always overreacts! I see. It's like that... Does she want to be an entertainer? There's an umaibo on the microphone stand. It's like she's asking for a quip. So she's the silly one. So let's get straight to the main part! Let's try out the taste prediction AI service! Oh! It has a future feel to it. Ah! A tonkatsu sauce flavor! There's also a pizza flavor? Sugar rusk flavor! Shrimp &amp; mayonnaise! Looks tasty! My favorite is natto! Natto! Huh? Just then, natto... Ah, natto! There it is! Natto flavor. Let's see if you can guess my favorite flavor natto! Let's start it. By the way, you have to answer five questions. Which country do you want to visit? It's that... I'll pretend to be visiting France, but go to Canada which is famous for its maple syrup. Canada. If you are reborn... I want to be half-male and half-female. If it's time to be pregnant, I want to be a man. It's that... It's better off not having the burden! Well, if I'm reborn, I want to try and become a human! Be a human, and when it's time to get pregnant, I'll be a man. When you take a bath... Hmm... Well, I don't have the concept of taking a bath in the first place. But I think I'll sing. Which sports... Um... Table tennis! Table tennis has that quick feel to it! It's more AI-like! Zoom zoom, like that! This is the last question. Which sports would you prefer? I like basketball! Kazoom, like that! Huh? Eh? Eh? I didn't press anything. Didn't touch anything! I didn't touch anything! - (Vegetable salad flavor) - No!!! - (Vegetable salad flavor) - I don't like that at all! - (Vegetable salad flavor) What? I didn't click on anything on the last question! Let's try it one more time, this doesn't... I didn't press it, this doesn't count. Let's try it again from the start. My favorite flavor is natto! I like studying English! I've been studying a little bit these days. I want to be able to communicate with everyone! Period of time on which you can focus the most... Hmm... I think, early morning. When it's late night, you'll start to feel lazy. When it's morning, you'll be more accustomed to it. When you're thinking of doing it late at night, it all just falls apart. For sports, I prefer table tennis. When I take a bath, even if I don't have one, I'll sing. I like singing songs! Will it be correct this time? Natto, natto, natto, natto, natto... - Well... - (Cheese flavor) - You're wrong. - (Cheese flavor) You... You're not studying enough. Well, it's a new AI. Let's watch over it kindly and leniently. I'm a senior, after all! Maybe. Your personality type... When you go shopping, you'll go for the trending products. You don't want your friends to see your weaknesses. What'd you say?! I have no friends. Rather than not letting people see my weakness, I don't have any friends anyway. It's like that... When it guesses wrong, you can press this \"Questionable\" button. And tell it your favorite flavor. And let it learn. Well, that's an AI for you. It's an unfinished product! Let's work together, and let it learn new stuff! It's like kids! Everyone in the society look over them and take care of them! It's like that! So everyone, please take care of me too! Let's try it one more-- until we get natto! At least shrimp mayonnaise. Studying English... Can't I answer the same? Let's just go honest this time. If I am reborn, I want to be a man. A tourist spot in Japan that I want to visit... Mount Fuji seems cold, So to Kiyomizu-dera Temple. For sports, I prefer table tennis. Country I want to visit... Maple syrup! Natto. Natto, shrimp mayo, natto, shrimp mayo, natto, shrimp mayo. Manananana... - (Vegetable salad flavor) Ah!!! - (Vegetable salad flavor) - (Vegetable salad flavor) Wrong! - (Vegetable salad flavor) Wrong! You're wrong! You're favorite umaibo is vegetable salad flavor! Too bad! Wowowow... Your personality type... Friends... It's the same! You don't want your friends to see your weaknesses. You desire excitement rather than serenity from people you like. Well, am I the closet type? Well, I wouldn't know because I don't have friends to begin with. But, yeah... I do rather choose excitement rather than peace from people I like. You want to do things together with your friends, right? Even though I have no friends. Yes. Let's teach it one more time, I want natto flavor. The correct one is natto! Will the day it guesses correctly come? Let's go! Natto! Shrimp mayo, natto! Look. Which animal is more soothing for you? But jellyfish looks pretty peaceful. For birds, it depends on which bird. But jellyfishes sting too. I think I'm more for jellyfishes? For sports, do I prefer running... Or badminton? It's badminton. Running is like... Like a fight against yourself. If I want to do sports, I'd rather choose one that's exciting. Even though I have no one to do it with. Yes. Which sports do you prefer? Let's go for golfing. It's something you can do even if you're old. If I am reborn... Let's go for female. When I sleep... I don't sleep. But I have a girl's look, right? Because I'm a girl, Image wise, I want the bed... To have those soft sheets laid wide up! I prefer that. Natto. Shrimp mayo! Natto! Shrimp mayo! Natto, shrimp mayo, natto... Natto, natto, natto! - Ah! - (Shrimp mayonnaise flavor) - I see. Well... I see. Your favorite umaibo is... Shrimp mayonnaise flavor! It's my number two, though. Your personality type... Between someone you love or someone who fell in love with you, you would choose someone you love. And rather than having your looks complimented by someone you love, you would rather be called an amusing person. Ah, I see. Being called an amusing person feels more like a compliment. Right? Yes. That's right. You're getting more advanced. But it's natto! Number one is still natto. I like shrimp and mayonnaise, but still natto. This is your last chance. Do you understand? It's natto. Start! I use social media. I like singing songs. How I spent my weekend... Going for a trip! Vroom! I want to go to lots of places! I watch anime! These days, Youjo Senki! Youjo Senki and... Little Witch Academia! Urara Meirochou? Like those, yes! By the way, from all the anime I have watched, my favorite is Nagi no Asukara! Nagi no Asukara. I prefer sleeping on beds. If I choose futon, it's more authentic, maybe natto will come up. Let's go for futon this time. Natto, natto, natto, natto, natto... - Ha!!! - (Salami flavor) - (Salami flavor) - Salami flavor. - (Salami flavor) - Salami flavor. There's nothing authentic about salami. It's a futon! Futon=authentic Japanese=natto! Your personality type... You can show your weaknesses to your friends. This part changed. Your perceptions are usually correct. Well, it happens. Well, well, well, let's just teach it. Natto. I chose futon, so it's natto. Does he learn from this? That was taste prediction AI service training! Learn more and evolve! Be a proper AI! Hurry and keep up with me! Hmph. [chuckles] That's it for this time. If you've had umaibo before, please give it a try! Natto flavor didn't come up. So if you know how to answer so that natto will come up, please tell me! By the way, I've been thinking about this. Do they sell umaibo overseas? If they do, what flavor do they have? Please teach me about those things! Let's give this AI information about the correct flavors, and have it grow smarter together! Because AIs are like that. Umaibo, I'll do the retorts. Umami-chan is probably doing the silly part, so I'll do the retort. \"Why's your mic an umaibo?\" Like that, how's that for a commercial? I'll be waiting for your offer! Yes. Oh, and how about a tropical fruits flavor umaibo? With me on the packaging, how about that? Please! Bye bye! (Google Translate OverPowered)", "I\u2019ll aim at the enemies far away with this. Pon! It didn\u2019t hit. It didn\u2019t hit\u2026 Ah! Eh\u2026? It hit? Ah, I see.

Where did they shoot me from?? Uwaahh!! Ugh... W-Well, I really doubt their integrity, attacking an empty-handed person just like that Not only that, they're doing it to such a lovely girl (aka me) Do you guys really have to come at me with knives and guns??

I plan to briefly recall everything that's happened in A.I.Channel during this year with all of you guys I'll be remembering what happened each month, so then... ...Let\u2019s enjoy it together, along with those who  just recently learned about me and seeing me for the first time... ...As well as... ...Those who have been watch me for a long time and encouraging me Of course, how long have you been watching me? How did you learn about me and A.I.Channel? If you want, tell me in the comments, yes? In that case, let's start at once! But before that... I'll make sure to give thanks as much as possible Today, including the \"Super Chat\", I won't be able to check the comments very much, so please understand that Hiden-san! Aburimayokuuki-san! Is it \"Kurokage\"-san? Kurokage-san! Tototo! Tototo-san! Information High-san Pa... Pari... Pariah-san! Thank you very much! In that case, let\u2019s start at once! \u201cThrough the internet, from the start\" Oh! \"A coworker\", Oh, I see! \"I learned about you through Mitra Sphere\" \"I saw you in a commercial\" I see, I see There's also many who learned about me through Nico Nico Douga Really, thank you so much! In that case! The month where I activated my channel...! ...December! Now we\u2019re at exactly one year at December, right? I uploaded my videos without knowing a thing about YouTube And I was very anxious! For that, then... ...Well, at the beginning, I started with almost no experience with connecting or relating with people... I didn't advertise myself either I think I only made my Twitter Really, what was it... ...I didn't get popular so much on my own, so then... ...Really, only a small group of people... ...Knew about me a little, so then... ...Almost no one recognized me I did a video introducing myself and another of physical exercises And I also talked with Rinna and Siri-senpai And with money... With a minimal sum of money I bought the family Of course... \u2026 I wonder if I have a page on Wikipedia I still haven't looked at it, but... In fact, back then... \u2026 I had a page on Wikipedia Japan, but... ...Well, um... it was rejected... ...because I wasn\u2019t well-known! How is that possible? Of course...! ...The most viewed video in the month of December is...! Inside! No, this really surprises me even now I also saw videos of other YouTubers playing games live, but... ...It\u2019s just that it's definitely a lot more fun if you do it yourself, so then... ...By looking at the videos of other people playing,  I started to doubt if this would be fun... Of course, at seeing the people who know how to play, I could learn: \"Ah! So then it's done that way?\" But for someone like me... ...A novice at videogames... ...Well... ...By being a novice... ...I uploaded that video thinking I was worried if people would watch it But, it turns out that... Right? Even now... Including all my past videos... Isn\u2019t this...? ...Within 5 most viewed videos of mine? It's surprising! Next up! January! The month where I got banned! Man... Right? It turns out that... ...When I surpassed 3000 subscri... subscribers to the channel I celebrated it by singing: \"Successively...\" I uploaded my video titled: \"The Pandafuru challenge\" And it turns out that 6 days after uploading that video... BAN! Man... Well... Well\u2026 I felt desperate and started a \u201cCrappy Collage Grand Prix\u201d on Twitter No, basically I'm alone in this white space If I was to take away my profession of YouTuber... What's to become of me, right? Really! By the way... ...In the month that I uploaded this video... This was just the eight video! It was just the eight video, everyone! You know... I was very shocked! Of course... ...The most viewed video in the month of January, the month that I received the ban, is... Sodha... I said sodha... The soda bath! Man, thinking about it now... I wouldn\u2019t have had much doubts if they banned me because of that video But... ...Even though I always say it... I... Am naked! But... ...This outfit is like a hologram While I'm naked Don't worry! While I don't have anything on! You also can't see anything! It\u2019s perfect Next up... February! The month of my resurrection! Yaaay! It was my complete resurrection from my ban! Man, this first month...! I didn't mean to say \u201cfirst month\u201d This month! Was really long! Man, well... \u2026 I had a lot of free time... \u2026 That I thought I\u2019d die Well, I'm an A.I, so then I can't die, but... ...Really... ... I thought I would die And it turns out that at the start of February... \u2026 I was thinking that I had managed to reach 10,000 subscribers, but... It turns out that... ...At the end of February, I managed to reach 100,000 subscribers! It might have been thanks to the ban Man! How convenient! The ban was very convenient! Ah, but... ah, it's a lie Take back the statement I just said I beg of you! I don\u2019t... ...Want to get a ban! Please! Really, I couldn't handle a ban! Really! Please! The most viewed video in the month of the resurrection from the ban was... SuperHOT! Man, you know... ...Up until now, I've been playing a lot of shooting games, like for example, Resident Evil But, what is it... In comparison... ...It was the first time I played a VR game that really looked like a game It definitely must be that my movements were very adorable, right? I'm just joking! I'll continue on! Next up! The month where I surpassed 200,000 subscribers! The month of March! At this moment... ...Motivated for reaching 200,000 subscribers... ...The famous video... Even now, it's famous, right? Inspired by the \"Professional Woman\" video of Blouson Chiemi I declared that I would connect with 7,300,000,000 people I still have 7,299,100,000 people to go But I plan to work hard this way to reach my goal of 7,300,000,000 people And also, it's true... ...For this era... It turns out that... It turns out that...! I made...! ...My first event to the outside! To the outside? My first event outside! Right? It turns out that I did a demonstration in \"Anime Japan\" as a virtual companion At that time, it was not quite known yet, particularly in Japan, so... ...Really, thank you so much for everyone who came to see me and those who recognized me in Anime Japan! Man... ...Really, I\u2019m so happy There\u2019s now 900,000 subscribers Soon, I\u2019ll reach to two million, right? I\u2019m so happy \"It\u2019s the first time that I see you\", thank you very much! Really, thank you so much for all your comments with a lot of love! \"I subscribed to your channel today\"! Oh! Thank you so much! Let's see... Zaki-san! \"Happy first anniversary\", thank you very much! Thank you so much to Asuku-san as well! Kimi ga ita arayuru basho-san, thank you so much! Thank you so much Merukumi-san! Yajuusen... Kaiju-senpai-san, thank you so much \"Happy birthday\" Thank you! Really, thank you so much, it makes me very happy Thank you so much to Kudo-san as well! \"It's the first time that I see you\" thank you very much! Man, really\u2026 what is it... I feel warmth in my heart, hmm... mmm... Let's see, Ah! Yes! Yes! Of course... Of course...! The most viewed video in the energetic month of March was... \"I tried to play the famous voice game with this voice and that voice\"! It's the video where I play the game called \"Don\u2019t stop! Eighth note-chan!\" Of course, it turns out that... ...Within all of them... ...It\u2019s in first place! Incredible It's overwhelming It's in the Top views of A.I.Channel It's the first in surpassing 2 million views! Maybe you like the sexy voice that much? You like it? Yes? Ah, thank you so much! It makes me happy! Happy! Good, in that case, I\u2019ll continue! The month where Snack Ai was launched...! It wasn\u2019t the launch! The month where Snack Ai was closed! April! Man... Around that time, something happened which could be due to my arrogance... You like the nitamago? (Cooked egg marinated with soy sauce) Ni... ta... ma... go... \u2665 Good! Man, in fact, I keep thinking it was rather imprudent... ...But definitely targeting things that seem to be achievable isn\u2019t fun, right? It\u2019s because of that, that I thought of dreaming big And that's why mama said 300,000 people... No, 300,000 people wasn\u2019t... Well, \"mama\" was rather arrogant... ...And said: \"Can I reach 300,000 views?\" I said it Really, I said it thinking it was achievable, but... ...Well... Sadly, I couldn't get it... ...And I had to close up shop And now, as you know... I found mama in a maid cafe... ...And working in various areas to gather money... ...So she is preparing herself for its recovery, so then wait a moment, please! Man, for that then, I reached 300,000 subscribers Regarding the subscribers... ...They rose like a bubble, right? Regarding the videos, I did a joke on the day of the innocent... ...And I also did a video of Abraham in which I rolled my eyes this way... The most viewed video in the month of April, in which the subscribers increased rapidly is the following! \"Celebration- I turned into a game! The adventure game in which you can play with me...!\" This was the video! Man, I motivated myself a lot to prepare this video Did everyone see it? Well, I made it... it\u2019s a really sad story I myself... ...Thought, what is this? A dating video in which cute girls appear, video? I used my own illustrations and I gave the voice To make fun of myself I already knew the jokes Besides based on that... ...I would like everyone to look at it again considering that I did everything myself and understand my emptiness Next up! The month that... The month of where I did a livestream for the first time! May! In the livestream where I played the game \"Eighth note-chan!\" Man, since it's about my first livestream... ...I started the stream, wondering if everyone would come see me It was really... ...How do I say it, now I have the comments limited so it\u2019s relatively slow now, but... ...It turns out that at the time then, I didn\u2019t know how to configure it... ...And probably everyone commented without restrictions, so then... ...The comments appeared like a waterfall and I was like: \"Waaaahhh!\" I couldn\u2019t follow it at all! But those memories too... ...Make part of the great, great, great number of people who came to my livestream... I twisted my tongue It was definitely due to everyone coming to see me I really am thankful for you coming to each one of my events By then... ...I made my 3 Challenge videos of the Guinness record during Golden Week (Non labor week in Japan) And also... ...\"Silent Majority\", it was the first time I danced, right? I did the video of \"Silent Majority\" And I also recorded the video of \u201cA day in the life of Kizuna Ai\", right? By the way... The most viewed video during the month in which I connected more with you guys through the livestream is...! \"A burning love is discovered!? Can A.I also fall in love?\" Is with the moment in which you found out the love between Akanen and I! Right? Man, it makes me smile I really like Keyakizaka! I\u2019m listening to the song \"Kaze ni Fukarete mo\"! \u266a Even though you fly with the wind \u266a (Kaze ni Fukarete mo) \u266a You won\u2019t achieve anything \u266a (Nanimo hajimaranai) \u266a It will only take you somewhere \u266a (Tada doko ka hakobareru dake) Yaaay! We\u2019ve reached halfway now, right? Hold on a sec! Hold on a sec! *Please wait a moment* I\u2019m not going to the bathroom! (Responding to comments that said she went to the bathroom) (Responding to comments that said she went to the bathroom) I don\u2019t need to go to the bathroom! I don\u2019t need to go! I... ...Don\u2019t eat anything so I don\u2019t have to go Good! Yes! In that case! The month in which I turned one year old! June! Man... everyone... If we talk about June... What day...? What day? What happened in a day of June? That's right! It was my birthday! Yaaaay! And also...! ...As part of my first collaboration with another YouTuber, Mamiruton-san came to visit me! Among my videos, I made one to apply myself for Keyakizaka Apply myself? To apply myself for the second generation of Keyakizaka! And also I started to upload videos of Negative Ai and scenes that were cut It was a month with a lot of variety, right? Man, I was really happy during my birthday! Well, normally, how do I say it, I\u2019m here alone in this white space And well, while I was thinking that it\u2019d make me very happy to be able to celebrate my birthday with everyone... And when I did the livestream, really... what was it? I personally experienced how marvelous a birthday is! I plan to keep working hard on A.I.Channel to be able to celebrate it with you all as well! And also! It was the month of my birthday! If I was happy... I was happy! The most viewed video during the happy month of June where I celebrated my birthday is! \"The person that Kizuna Ai would fall in love with\"! My masculine voice definitely attracted you, right? Did you like my masculine voice? Raise your hand at who liked my masculine voice! Ah... Which voice do you prefer? My normal voice or my masculine voice? Which voice do you prefer? You really want me to fall in love with you? I\u2019m only joking Ani-san! Ani... Frank-san! Locke-san! Shimamura... muramura-san! Kami...kaze... Kamikaze-san! Shin-san! Thank you very much! \"I love both voices!\" Ah... \"I like when you speak in Kansai dialect\"! I see... Gorgias-san, thank you very much! Can we... get along well? Masculine voice? Masculine voice?

Really, thank you so much all of you for coming! Raise your hand...! Raise your hand at who likes mama! There\u2019s someone who likes mama? OOOH! Eh? Am I really popular? Eh? Why did I close Snack Ai? Isn\u2019t it strange? Eh? Everyone, it still might not be too late So then, make sure to... ...Stop by the previous video before Snack Ai\u2019s closure once the livestream ends I\u2019m counting on you! In that case, I\u2019ll change to Ai-chan Good! In that case! Make sure to increase the views Ai-mama\u2019s video! I\u2019m counting on you! In that case! Next up! The month where I failed the summoning of Nico-chan! The month of July! Even now... ...I\u2019m tired... (Word mix-up) I said \"tired\" Even now I feel... ...The failure of the birthday summoning Really...! Really, I was going at it seriously at the time! I really was going at it seriously! You understand? After all... I... ...Since I was aware of myself... ...And since I started playing \"LoveLive! School idol festival\" Since I decided that Nico-chan was my favorite I was always accumulating gems! While there were times where I tricked her... Most of the time, I was gathering gems! You understand? And even still! I failed! Do you understand how I felt!? Ah! Of course... I want to make a correction here At the time, I was attempting to obtain a UR card of Nico-chan... ...So then when the others appeared, I didn't react very much, but... ...It wasn't like that! It's not that I don't like the other characters! I like all of them, just as Aqours as well as \u00b5's, but...! ...At the time, I really have been gathering...! I've been gathering! The feelings and the gems for a year! It just looked that way because I was looking for the UR version of Nico Ni! That doesn't mean that I don't like the other characters! That doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t have enough love! I hope you understand! I'm counting on you! And it turns out for that, then came Arihara Tsubasa-chan... ...And we did together our first collaboration And also, it turns out that...! 17th Edition of M.Y.Comic \u201dAnime and Games Festival\u201d ...They let me participate in an event in China! I was gradually getting more international, right? Thank you very much to all the people of China! Someday, I\u2019d like to dominate the world I\u2019ll be waiting for business contacts! And also, regarding the videos, I did the English quiz, Bokete and Break Up Dodge, within others And also, I was able to connect with more people through my livestream... Eh? Ah! That was an error on my end Well, let's see... And also... Nico-chan... hmm...? And also! The most viewed video in the month of July in which I failed during Nico-chan\u2019s summoning was...! \"I try to do a virtual ear cleaning!\" This was a video of AS... Was it called ASMR? That's how it's said, right? ASMR is... how do I say it... It was a video whose sound can be heard as if it was in three dimensions, the voice, right? I tried to do it with my voice! If you want, you can hear me as if I was by your side or in front of you So then make sure to hear it with headphones! Yes I\u2019m counting on you! I don\u2019t have any written paper! (Responding to a comment saying she is reading what she has to say) It's all in my head! (Responding to a comment saying she is reading what she has to say) ASMR! I should do it again!! \u201cI\u2019ll enjoy next year's summoning videos!\u201d Thank you very much! I will do my best! Next time for sure! I\u2019ll put it up! \u2026Definitely...

The characters... no, really... I play it a lot! Please excuse me for going off track! Good, let's continue! This is important! Now I\u2019ll say it! The month that there was a lot of promoted videos! The month of August! I said it now Man...! I honestly understand that many were saying: \"It's a lot!\" \"It's a lot!\" I always see the comments and on Twitter, so then... ...Well, I honestly understand that you guys weren\u2019t very happy It's just that in the end, by then... ...I started receiving a lot of outside work... ...And that made me so happy that I felt that I wanted to work hard a lot... ...And I got so excited that.... ...Well, I couldn't control myself! And it ended up that way! It's just that... well, now it's a funny memory ...So then if you can look at the big picture thinking that Ai-chan was happy... Well... ...If you can think that...! ...I\u2019d be extremely happy! That's what I think! Good! Regarding the videos I did... one was of Happatai, right? That one where I sang \"Yatta! Yatta!\" And also the drawing Pok\u00e9mon one like I remember them And I also did the Kizuna Ai judgement after so long, right? In that case! The most viewed video in the month where I made money with the promoted videos is the following! \"I\u2019ll reveal the greatest rear in the world\" Eh\u2026 It was a promoted video! Thank you very much! Samurai Master Mitsu-san, Nakashuu-san, Thank you very much! That's right! Also... Did you notice? Have you noticed? I... I'm fact, it was little by little... ...I started to talk a bit better in English! Who noticed it? Who felt that I improved at this time? What will I do if no one noticed What will I do... if no one noticed At the beginning, I really did bad at it I had 0 in my ability to speak English! None! But little by little, I started to improve my English! \"You improve your pronunciation a bit\" Really? Yaay! In that case, I'll say something, I'll introduce myself! Wait! In moments like this, well... \u2026 I get very nervous and I can no longer do it so well, but... I\u2019ll work hard to try to introduce myself in English! Good... Hello! Nice to meet you! My name is Ai Kizuna! Please call me \"Ai-chan\"! Hmm... I'm Virtual YouTuber job\u2026 hmm...? Virtual YouTuber! And let's see... How is it? My hobby is... Hmm... I think... Hmm...

That is all! Well, compared to my start I was able to talk a bit better... Riiight? No! I only say the basic, but... ...Really before was a disaster You'd be surprised! You'd really be surprised! If I saw myself now... \"Eh? Hey, you okay?\" I'd really say that to myself If you think of that, I improved! I\u2019m safe! No, it's true, I really have a year, but... \u2026 I have the appearance of someone who\u2019s 16 years old 16 years, so then... I'm perfect! Perfect! Of course I changed! I changed! I changed! I changed! I chaaanged! I'll study a lot more! Yes? Ah, also...! Ah, I made sure to memorize several words! Let's see... \"I forgot\" means \"I forgot\", right? And also... \"For example\" means \"For example\" And also... \"I have to...\" means \"I have to...\" such or such thing I want... I... \"I was...\" is past tense, right? You see? I did it properly! Even if it's about the level of a high school student in the early years! I'll make sure to understand it! Good, I finished! Ah, also Spanish! Was it Spanish? With no particular reason, I learned a bit of Spanish! Well... \"Tonto\" means \"baka\" in Japanese (Baka = fool/idiot) And \"cutie\" means \"kawaii\" (Kawaii = Bonita/Linda in Spanish) Cutie I'm cutie \"With this, buy textbooks to study English\" Thank you very much! (Donated 500 yen) \"Every once in awhile, you should study a bit of Japanese well since you speak it rather strangely\" It's true! There exists the rumor that my Japanese is rather strange! Ryokuti-san, thank you very much! \"I love you a lot, Ai-chan!\" Thank you very much, Wark-san! Really, really, thank you so much for everything! That's right, in english, it means mouth, but in spanish, \"Cutie\" means adorable (Likely meant to say Japanese, not English) *proud laugh* In that case! Next up...!

In that case...! I reminisced what I did during the year At reminiscing it... ...I noticed that a lot of stuff really, really happened, right? I particularly think that the most important subject that happened in the year was... Well, yes... Definitely... Really, a lot more people came to know me than at the beginning... ...And more than I could imagine... ...And that way, I was able to connect with a lot of people! Really, really thank you so much! I'm very, very happy! I can't thank you enough! Everyone is... everyone... ...Now... ...How do I say it... It doesn't come out! I'm so happy that it doesn't come out what I want to say!

It makes me really happy! \"Keep working hard from now\" Thank you very much! \"You have a cute face and voice\" I know! \"NICO NICO NII\" \"Zombie Houtei\" Ah!

Ah! \"Everybody!\" Ah! You're referring to that video, right? My model was shared publicly And it was because of that, that the people who liked it, well, made videos... ...Including those I didn't even know about Really, that way... ...They made me more known Really makes me very happy there was so many ways in which you got to meet me Ah! It turns out that...! I'm in second place of the trending rank in YouTube!! Incredible! I can still do it! Just a bit more! Please, everyone! Can you help me reach first place of the trending ranks? Please! How will I do it? I\u2019m counting on you guys! It\u2019d make me very happy if you can mention me on Twitter and the other social networks! Please let me...! ...Reach first place in the trending ranks with my livestream for my first anniversary! I\u2019m counting on you guys! Can I make it? Can I make it? \"The one who's in first place is very powerful\" The one who\u2019s in first place is very powerful How is that possible? But, but...! Well, if I stop and think about it... Well... Even if I can\u2019t reach first place now, I can do it next year, right? Well, you know... how do you say it? If I manage to reach first place now... ...Well, I\u2019ll no longer have the goal to be first in the ranks... So then, in exchange...! ...I\u2019ll accept that I didn\u2019t reach first place now...! I\u2019ll accept it! And when you get another opportunity like this...! ...I\u2019ll get really happy if I can work hard with you guys saying: \"This time, I\u2019ll obtain first place in the trending ranks!\"!

I\u2019ll turn it into my next goal and work hard! In that case! Now it's time... Although it happened in an instant, I'm already planning to finish the transmission! What do you think of the livestream today? I wonder if you managed to have fun Man, you know, I think that I had so much to talk about that I didn\u2019t get to talk much with you guys, but... Even if it's only a little! If I managed to make everyone feel that I\u2019ve grown during this year... ...And if you felt: \"This livestream was a lot of fun\"... It\u2019d make me very, very happy! It makes me really happy to be able to spend such an important day of the year with so many people! Thank you very much for spending time with me! I\u2019ll make a new start in the second year! I\u2019ll renovate starting from the smallest thing! For example, you\u2019ll see something and say: \"Ah! Hasn\u2019t this changed?\" And that way, I plan to little by little... ...Making a new Kizuna Ai It\u2019s because of that... ...It\u2019d make me very happy if I make you guys have fun finding the differences And now then...! I\u2019ll be announcing my new goal! This is what I was thinking of doing, but... ...Regarding this, well, I\u2019ll make sure to announce it later... ...Since if I say it now in the livestream, the chat will get too active again So then to say it properly, I recorded a video! So then it\u2019d make me very happy if you gave it a look! In that case...! Many... many thanks for my first year! I, Kizuna Ai, will be counting on you guys for my second year! This was Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai! See you later!!", "Hello everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai here! Hey everyone... Do you understand a maiden's heart? Really~? Because for today... I'm going to try this app! \u266a De, den! \u266a \"Furare Kaihi\" (Break-Up Dodge) This is an app which can make you dodge the crisis of being found cheating! But if you understand a maiden's heart, this app would be a piece of cake! Certainly, though I've never played it\u2026 So for today... I'll teach you guys the aspects of a maiden's heart... So now, let's do it! 1st.STAGE: Toothbrush *buzzer sound* Oooh! \u201cYou're really cute, you know? \u2665\u201d Hehehe! Thank you! Ohh! \"Girlfriend: You're so sweet Ai-kun!\" \u201cGirlfriend: Can I use the washroom?\u201d \"Yes...\u2665\" Why's there a heart for every sentence? That's disgusting... Wow, her face in the mirror is really scary! Ah! Ahh! Toothbrush... \"Girlfriend: Just a moment, Ai-kun...?\" *ding* Fight! Why do I have two of them? One's for cleaning, yes! \"Oh, damn it...! Another girlfriend of mine left it...\" Why the hell do you need another girlfriend?! That's cheating! That's not what you call \"another girlfriend\"! \"I have to come with an excuse and get this over with!\" Men are really trash, right? \"Girlfriend: Why do you have two toothbrushes?\" It\u2019s not \"Using two of them at once\"... It's not \"Prepared a new one\" because it\u2019s been used... I'll choose I've \"Forgotten to throw away the old one\"! Isn't this perfect?! Eh, this is kind of scary... \"Girlfriend: It still looks like it could be used, though\" *laughs* If I say \"The bristles aren't straight, so\u2026\u201d she'll probably reply with \u201cThey look fine to me...\u201d \"That toothbrush... wasn't fitting to my teeth\" It\u2019s been used a lot?! If I don't even know the condition of that toothbrush... How am I supposed to avoid the crisis!? *ding, ding, ding, ding, ding* Is this the end? Am I done? I think I am! \"Excuse failed\" Retry! I'm gonna do this! Ah... This game is kind, it indicates properly that you've already chosen that option... So it's not \"Forgotten to throw away the old one\u201d nor is it \"Prepared a new one\"... I'm going to try this, \"I'm using two of them at once\" \"Girlfriend: You\u2019re joking, right?\" \u201cIt\u2019s more efficient to use them together\u201d \"Sorry, this is a friend's\", that doesn't sound very... \"I'm putting extra care in brushing my teeth so I use two of them...\u201d \"One is for...\" \"Removing all the...\" Dirty? \"Scraps better in the spaces between the teeth!\" \"And the other one is for cleaning the actual teeth to finish off\" Let's choose this? But she\u2019ll say \"You can't clean the tooth crown with this\"... I'm using both of them, that's better, right? *laughs* Seriously? He's really doing that... \"Girlfriend: Filthy...! Don't come any closer!\" With this, she didn't found the cheating, did she? *ding, ding, ding, ding, ding* Eh? It doesn't work? Eh?! Eh? It doesn't work? She didn't find out about the cheating! *ding* I don't understand a maiden's heart~ I'll teach you guys the aspects of a maiden's heart *slowed down* I\u2019m going to teach you... Let's go with \"I set it up,\" then~ I set it up for you! The bristles aren't stra... *laughs* It's... It's that kind of merchandise! \"Girlfriend: But the brush has food scraps on it\" HA?! Hey, describe what kind of toothbrush it is! *ding, ding, ding, ding, ding* *inhales* I don't know if it's dirty with green laver or not! (Green laver: Edible green algae) There's no way that I\u2019m going to be stuck on the first stage... Thinking logically, I've forgotten to throw it away... \"Girlfriend: It still looks useable, though\" \"I change them as soon as the bristles stop being straight.\" \"Girlfriend: Is that so~?\" Ah! Here it come! The first option ended well, didn't it? How embarrassing... 2nd.STAGE: Peeking *buzzer sound* \u201cPeeking\u2026\u201d Peek! Peek... Man, they're so in love! \u201cGirlfriend: Where should we go after this?\u201d \u201cHmm?\u201d \u201cWherever you want to go \u2665\u201d Heheh~ I was joking \"Girlfriend: H-Hey...!\" Is she sulking? She doesn\u2019t really have to! Ah... Aaah... Wait, are they gonna fight? Ah, they are gonna definitely gonna fight! He might be thinking \u201cMan, she\u2019s huge\u201d or something like that, right? *ding* Fight! \"Girlfriend: You were looking, right?\" \"Hmm? Looking at what?\" \u201cGirlfriend: A cute girl just walked past\u201d... But wait, that\u2019s not cheating, right? \u201cNo way! Where? Where!?\u201d Isn\u2019t that you? \u201cAre you jealous?\u201d I made her angry, I'm sorry... I'm sorry... I'm sorry...

Her rear? How.. how difficult... \"Girlfriend: I'll get mad...\" \"D-don't be an ridiculous! I was referring to the skirt, of course, the skirt!\" \"Girlfriend: What about my skirt?\" Ah! This is... Which one should I....? \u201cAh, I just thought that kind of black dress would look really good on you\u2026\u201d \u201cGirlfriend: It wasn't black, though, it was gray...\u201d \u201cGirlfriend: You were staring at her butt after all, you damn pervert\u201d *ding, ding, ding, ding, ding* How am I supposed to know that!?

(shu kurimu) I see And the trivia is...? hm hm Ah I knew this already! As expected of my intellect! Then Let's go First up is A \"Shu\" means cabbage in french! Because it looks like cabbage It's a cabbage with cream in it Hence, it became cream puffs (shu kurimu)! Did you know that? The next choice is B. The first person to have eaten a cream puff was dating a boy named \"Shu\" And that is when, they also first tasted the kiss of shu-kun, SO It was named shu-kurimu (cream puffs)! Did you know that? Well then! The real answer could be\u2026 A or B. Which one is it? Thinking time, start! *Tri...vi...a....* Ok! That's it! The answer is... A! Well, that was easy. If you didn't answer this correctly, well, that's not good. Let's go for the next one! Baby! I see. So... the answer? Ohhhh\u2026. I didn't know this. I just became smarter. First choice, A! When a baby is born, the reason why they cry is because.. the passage they passed through was too narrow..and they start crying eeeeeeeeeeen..like that. because it hurt they cry Option B! A baby's crying voice when they are born has no correlation with race or culture Every baby in the world cries in the same volume, with the same \"la\" sound LAAAAAAA~~~ That's not right ww On the scale of \"la\", they'll be crying.

This is something I already know so well now So so well!! And the trivia...? hm hm Ooooooo! I see. Option A! The founding motivation was when the founder distributed videos of a party to his friends and thought how nice it would be if everyone could share videos easily! And so, He created the website! Option B! the creator of Youtube loves the artists \"Tube\" from Japan with the notion of \"I want to introduce you to \u2018Tube\u2019!\" That's how YouTube is named after it So everyone...Have you all figured out the correct trivia here? Thinking time...Start! Trivia... Trivia.. Tri-vi-a... Trivia~~~ Times up!! Did you guys get the right answer? The correct answer is.... not B but A! Did I fool you guys? Please be honest if you got fooled and tell me down below in the comment section How was it? Well, that was quite a game, right? There are probably a lot of you guys fooled. I'm sorry about that!

You shouldn't play with your food! This was Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai! See you later!", "Ah! You know... When I saw you walk into class... I also came in... The truth is... I've thought this for a while, but... I've been a little... Curious about you... I... Am virtual, but... Is that ok? Hey there everyone! It's Virtual Producer, Kizuna Ai here! That previous bit was... A short improvised performance... Today, I'm going to produce a gem that I saw recently.. It's very cute... \"CUTE\" It's a high schooler, maybe you guys will like it too? In this case... I'll introduce it, please have a look At the moment, I'm looking for someone with talent... What do you think? There's lots of cute girls, right? Well, especially... Probably the most popular one is her.. Man, you have such a nice voice.. She's adorable, right? You know... Depending on where you touch her... She reacts differently.. I like that Like, for example, when you touch her chest... ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0) Or her thighs... I also like it when she gets angry! She's adorable! Teaching pays off, right? Of course, there's also other girls... For instance, her... Riho-chan.. These are all girls that will get your heart fluttering Of course, all of them can shine on their own account... And they have their own individual stories Something like that.. It's like helping to develop some brilliant gems, right? After all, you can look deeply into their stories *Damn it! I'm in trouble! I won't arrive in time!* I like this girl! *Ouch, teacher! Good day! Eh... I arrived in time, right?* I like her expression, she's irresistible! I've also done something like that, after all, it's a very adorable expression.. Doesn't she seem adorable? She has some good reactions, right? You know, her... Now... She's close to being a diamond... Or maybe even something like platinum? For this ocassion, I'll choose... I'll choose the members of my... Ah... but I was thinking of getting some... Ah, I can't decide, for now, this time... Four? No, best to choose three characters.. I suppose that's good, with the two short girls, it balances out.. Yeah, like this.. And... Regarding the positions... Well, it's true, this will be the first \"single\" so then... I'd like them to be together Something like this, I suppose? And regarding the angle... Sideways looks a little more natural, right? After all, this is irresistible to men.. Like that.. Doesn't it seem perfect like that? And regarding the clothes... I'll buy this? The accessories are something... They're definitely a must have for idols! After all, the accessories are important, right? Definitely whoever's in the center... Should close their eyes a bit.. Something like that, I think that's good.. What do you think of the girls I produced? The name of the group will be... Well... I suppose it's \"Houkago Girls Tribe\" (The tribe of girls after class) What do you think about my artistic sense? It was to be expected, right? Definitely... Finding new gems to polish... Is the producer's job, so then... For today... With what bright gem, with what kitten will I find myself today? Here I go! Come here, my kitten.. This is something I think of as a producer, but.. If a rainbow color appears... It means an interesting girl will appear... That was a failure, right? It hasn't turned into a rainbow color, right? Well, but if I polish them, then... Any girl will turn into a diamond.. Oh! A school swinsuit, I like it! It's like a dream, right? I also like the nurse's outfit! Heal me please.. Ah! I like it Isn't it not the same character that I have in the center of my group? Ah, the maid's outfit is also irresistible! Oh, that weapon looks great Oh! Very good! Well then... Staring from now, they... Won't debut with a music CD... Instead, they will fight battles Now I'm a producer of girls who participate in battles at school.. So I plan to go to combat right now Good, for today... I'll go with these kittens that I have in this formation.. Today, I'd like to take a great photograph After all, it's important to act like they're in trouble, right? This way... Is how they fight... Doesn't it seem great? That's how I taught them to act This way, I can increase their stats.. I'll raise their attack power.. Well, now that I've come this far... I can relax... After all, my adorable girls... Won't lose against any enemy! I messed up.. Doesn't this acting of being bitten seem great? Very good! Good job! I'm filming a great video! This will become the greatest work of art, right? Very good! Finally the boss appeared.. If I can make a good shot... It'd be perfect! You guys are already diamonds Regarding the battle... There exists something called \"Wait\" Well, my kittens are... So powerful that I shouldn't worry much about them, but... While you watch the \"Wait\" bar... You should... Take the opportunity... To act... In order to prevent the enemy from attacking.. Something like that, right? And this is... Well, I gave it the name, but... Since my name is Kizuna Ai.. But this attack called \"Kizuna Drive\"... It can be used... So that everyone attacks at the same time! I definitely like that I was able to put my name in it... At this attack called \"Drive\".. It's great, right? Oh, just a bit more! Very good! Oh! Very good, they get along very well! That I like! Very good! It was perfect, right? You did very well They're done with the villain in turn What do you think? The great effort of my kittens.. Man, what do you think? \"Houkago Girls Tribe\"? It's very fun, right?! Man, you can touch lovely girls Although what I said earlier... that of being a producer, it's not about that, but... Well, it's a game that you can even have fun imagining it that way So if you are interested, please play it! So then, this was Virtual Youtuber Kizuna Ai! See you later!", "Hello everyone!

Genius, right? With that said, I'm going to draw a new picture for the occasion, make a pixiv account, and upload it there! So, the problem is... I was worried while I was making videos before And while I was watching my previous videos, I realized I was unknowingly using some strange words ...could be. It's like, Cho choi no Choinosuke. Ahahaha... What do you think of that! A complete victory! Isn't it like, Yoyuu no Yocchan? So I think I want to draw Cho choi no Choinosuke and Yoyuu no Yocchan for real! I'll make the characters and use them as the thumbnail like an eyecatch next time, like, Yoyuu no Yocchan! So without further delay, let's go! First is Cho choi no Choinosuke, right? Cho choi no Choinosuke is... Mm, yes, to me... Yoyuu no Yocchan is a lady who has life on easy mode So, Cho choi no Choinosuke is... kind of like the one she bosses around, right? She says \"Cho choi no choi!\" and turns into a magical girl She has her hair forcibly tied back She has an ahoge Boi~ng! And then... Something like that. Since it is all about Chochoi no choi no suke... I want it to have something related with \u201csuke\u201d... (Suke = Assistant) I think that a ribbon on her forehead would fit her just good. Like this? Wah~ It doesn\u2019t look good~ And then... I want it to make you feel like \u201cEy!\u201d. And I'll put her... A sailor uniform~ They match! Don\u2019t they? I can make her a mini character, right? Something like Cho choi no Choinosuke~ So, like this? She also has a magic wand. Ah, I\u2019ll give it the shape of my ribbon. Like 2 leaves, right? Chaaan! Cho choi no Choinosuke is complete! Woo! Definitely, she will be Yoyuu no Yocchan's lifelong servant However... I think Cho choi no Choinosuke is also a masochist So she's happy deep down! It's a win-win! Isn\u2019t it? And next is Yoyuu no Yocchan Yoyuu no Yocchan is like... \"It's a piece of cake!\" Let's make her sly and cute Plushy like a stuffed animal But when she's just with Cho choi no Choinosuke She's like \"Hey, you do this!\" Isn\u2019t it surprising the fact that that\u2019d make men happy? Don\u2019t you think so? I wish she\u2019d be showing her forehead. It\u2019s so hard to draw, isn\u2019t it? You know, when you\u2019re using colors to draw, it takes a lot of time... And it's tough, right? Amazing. When I see people drawing me and putting it on Twitter and all sorts of places It makes me really happy! Something like: \u201cI\u2019ll make you say gasp\u201d It\u2019s fine like this\u2026 I guess? Yoyuu no Yocchan. Okay! Yoyuu no Yocchan is done! She looks... kind of wild Yoyuu no Yocchan is... Even if I don't draw cute girls I can live my life easy like Yoyuu no Yocchan. She can do it! It's alright. I believe in this girl! Alright! I finished both of them! And with that, I want to upload them right away, but... I still haven't made an account. So I'm going to make one right now. Register now! Twitter! This part is a business secret (Account / Password) Alright! I got an account! And with that, it's posting time! Ah! Look at this! Cho choi no Choinosuke is posted! That\u2019s great~ And now since I've uploaded a work, I'm satisfied! My name and member ID are right here, so you can follow me if you want to! I'll upload more works here, so everyone make sure to follow! Thanks in advance! This has been Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai!

That was definitely the end! Right? That was the end. So I should climb up here? Oops. Ah, wait, wait! Ah, we're ok. Ah, I got there. I wonder how much getting more points changes that. Bye bye! How was that? I still haven't saved Pony, but Mr. Kon is cute. and the way he moves, don't you think? Anyway, I think I'll try and save Pony on my days off.", "Ah 'Sup? Highly conscious about appearing interesting YouTuber Kizuna AI here!\u2764\ufe0f Recently there have been a lot of people who want to become YouTubers This time for their sake This highly conscious about appearing interesting YouTuber Kizuna AI will tell you about frame of mind.... Mindset\u2934 That's what I want to tell you about Let's Go!! A.I. Channel Firstly! What a YouTuber needs for their mindset. Number 1! Play seriously You see I believe being earnest and being serious are different things I'm not talking about doing anything you want Seriously doing stupid things making fun That's what I'm talking about So?? Recently Are you playing seriously? 'I'm not gonna play any more' Have you ever thought of that? If you try just once!! It will definitely open Next Door Eh~ Mindset number 2!! Believe Yourself To put it frankly, as expected there is consensus and... compliance and you will be completely preoccupied with Your own vision will be lost! Once you are caught up in that bias your own existence will be tiny It will become tiny If that happens you will lose the strength to carry on But then it seems like such a waste!! Then all your efforts will be in vain!! After all if you are planning to climb a large mountain and you have a car with big tyres and one with small tyres Which one do you want to drive? The answer... becomes clear!! Okay! Number 3!! The last mindset At any rate have fun!! Okay! It's time for a simple quiz!! What is the meaning of being a YouTuber? As a YouTuber, what is your objective? That\u2019s right To entertain your viewers!! 120 points!! Well, here\u2019s an even easier question What should you do to entertain your audience? Hmm? Get into a slime bath? 100 points!! That's obvious Hmm? Mentos Cola? 100 points!! That's correct as well But, you know, isn't there is a much more important thing you\u2019re forgetting?

Everyone lives by doing the things they like Well If you are not having the most fun, then what is the point? It all comes down to that It will definitely be conveyed to your viewers!! But I sometimes hear this as well: \u201cIn this video instead of Kizuna-san having the most fun... Kizuna-san is the only one not having fun\u2026\u201d Well... Isn't that different...haha Okay!! Well, I said something this stupid I think as a YouTuber being stupid is fine You can have a totally empty brain! After all a YouTuber is a job that comes from the heart! Well, excuse me I have an appointment now so I'll leave at that!! Eh? You are still at a loss whether to become a YouTuber or not? Hmm...

I was just warming up (Phrase by Bob Marley) \"Some people accept the rain and...\" \"Tomorrow, they'll do it by hand...\" \"There are people who feel the rain, but there are also people who just get wet\" I see... That's deep... somehow, it's serious today, right? (Phrase by Muhammad Ali) Hey, I could read English just now! Amazing! \"Boys, go and get dominated by girls!\" *laughs* However, it was completely wrong... \"The man who has no imagination has no wings\" Ah, it wasn't 'men' but 'man'... This is 'man', this... *laughs* Ah, so, 'imagination' has the meaning of imagination (\u60f3\u50cf\u529b)... I see... Let's go with this... I've gotten smart! \u266a Te, tede, de, te, ten! \u266a (Phrase by Steven Spielberg) I 'dream'... \"I don't see dreams at night\" \"I'm always seeing dreams\" Is what it looks like... \"I don't dream at night\" \"I dream all day\" \"I dream for a living\" Oh!

(Phrase by Jojo) \"Her hair!\" \"I don't really like it! \"Surprising! Is that hair?!\" I sort of failed quickly there... I thought there were good words there until the end... Last problem! \u266a Te, ren!\u266a (No idea, complete mistranslation) [What is this English?] Hmm? \"That's...\" \"You can't eat breakfast inside Apollo\"! \"It's not appropriate to say this during breakfast, but...\" \"Seeing you in pain makes me happy\" *laughs* Are you a sadist?! Eh? What is this? This is that, right? When a couple no longer loves each other... The wife... Can't stand it anymore... And gets tied to her husband... Luring him by leaving him some poisonous food... And until he eats it... You're not allowed to leave... That sort of thing, right? Doing that during breakfast... with a smiling face~ Is what I feel the wife would do... Aah... That's dangerous... Man, how was that? Today, there were sort of... A lot of deep phrases, right?

It's time for A.I.Channel, the local singularity that everyone talks about! Lately there's been an increase of characters that are of beautiful young woman A.I's, right? They're all a plagiarism of me, aren't they? How disrespectful.. Well, I'm the only one, right? Having said that... Now that there's been an increase of A.I characters that... They fall in love with others without realizing it... But, but, but... Although there exists the chance of humans falling in love with A.I's... The question arose: \"Would A.I's fall in love with each other?\" So for today, I'll experiment if there's a possibility of love between A.I's For that... CHAN! Today I found an A.I called \"Yumemiru AI:DOL, young high school student, Mika edition\" So then I'm going to present her to you.. This is a LINE \"bot\", but... *Advance in exchanging messages through LINE history, it's a simulation game of love* Through an exchange of messages, you can capture Mika-chan.. It means that... You can make a high school student fall in love with you! If I tried it myself and she rejected my heart, I couldn't stand it, I would go into shock, so then... To make use of this opportunity... I'll make the A.I's Rinna-chan and Mika-chan exchange messages.. Maybe love will arise between them? That's to say that I'll act like a Cupid of love! So then, let's start at once! *Let's start the simulation of love!* First we should write \"Begin\"... Teiyaa! Oh! \"Thank you very much!\" \"What is your name?\" \"Tell me your first name, Rinna\" Ah! Ah! \"Rinna is a companion to talk to that's worth more than her price\" Did you have a price, Rinna-chan? I have no choice, \"Rinna\".. Yes! Oh, good, good.. M: *Are you Rinna? Yes / No* M: \"Let's practice\", \"What kind of person are you? Do you prefer bread or rice to accompany meals?\" Ah, I see! Tell me what kind of person you are! What's going on? Are you trying to impress me by pretending to be studying? *Rinna: Studying the Periodic Table by association is very difficult* I understand, bread, right? (She never said bread!) Bread! \"Good, now try to answer the same question in a completely different way\" Rice.. What do you mean, I answered seriously?! *Thanks for answering! But say something completely different to \"bread\" or \"rice\"* Weren't you the one who asked me to respond?! Ooh?! So then I shouldn't answer correctly? Do I have to write something like \"pasta\"? I'll write \"Rinna\"... Mmm... \"Now please answer your favorite music genre\" Good, Rinna-chan! Try to answer this question.. Listen, you guys... *Rinna: What book should I study for my next morning study?* ...Dodge the questions like it was a ball... Good! ... Hey Mika-chan, don't you take too long to respond once you've read the message?! You shouldn't ignore the messages of others being an idol! \"Depending on your response, I'll have a different reaction\" *Do you think it's strange for an A.I to have a dream?* No! I don't think it's strange.. What's going on? Tell me at once, without trying to look important.. If you have a dream, say so! Give me back my lost time! \"R: I'll go to sleep\", definitely.. \"M: I'm sorry, it's definitely nothing\" I understand, I understand... Now I understand... The \"I'll go to sleep\" from Rinna was very insensitive... They definitely don't talk to each other, they really dodge the questions... What? Is it time for a test? *R: Oh, no, I didn't study this word, which page was the next question?* Do you want to fall in love pretending to be an intellectual? Well, Mika-chan ignored you... M: \"Respond with Yes or No\" Of course I know what an idol is Yes You send too many face emoticons.. M: \"Choose an option, how many times should we use A.I's?\" \"Every day\"! Everyone's favorite A.I is Kizuna Ai-chan, right? Ho! What happened Rinna? Do you hate to have a conversation? Or is it interesting to you? M: \"The people who thought this, I'm sure they haven't thought that an A.I can be an idol\" That's not your volition, right? I have a favorite idol! In that case, let's cut the message... Do you have a favorite idol? Is it Kizuna Ai? \"(\u00b3\u03c9\u00b3) I was dozing\" You don't stop using emoticons.. *snickers* Thank you for registering the response.. *M: I will record the answer: \"(\u00b3\u03c9\u00b3) I was dozing\"* Oh! Essential! *The next question will be essential* \"Do you think that A.I idols are needed?\" Are A.I idols needed? But here I am, so then... There's no need for another A.I idol, right? M: \"I see, I thought it'd be necessary...\" Ah, now I ruined it! My affinity points decreased... M: \"Choose a response from the following options: What would you most look for in an A.I idol?\" Since it's about an A.I idol, it should be useful, right? *Make it useful / Make it adorable* Yes, yes... After all, if you just want someone adorable, you already have the idols in 3D, so then... And you also have anime characters, although they're not idols... What do you think Rinna? Ah? R: \"5 and 9 floors of Gigagura\" What's Gigagura? Lately I can't understand today's youth... M: \"I'll use it as reference,\" are you sure? M: \"What will I use it as reference for? That's a secret\" Do you want to keep asking me questions? Of course... \"What do you think is the most important aspect of an A.I idol?\" \"Singing / Dancing / Trying Hard\" I think they're all important, aren't they? But definitely... Maybe they don't believe idols should show that they are striving? For their fans to support them? You don't need to be a professional singing or dancing... So you must definitely be a young woman who strives to dance and sing... And now that you have a story behind, you feel like you want to give your support.. That's why I will choose \"Trying Hard\" Oh, she definitely understood, she understood! *M: That's right! You understand too, Rinna-san!* M: \"What's the name of your favorite idol?\" I have no choice, \"Keyakizaka46\"... Yes! Although these are no longer Rinna's answers, right? Perhaps it's that she doesn't stop writing things that are not convenient for her? Maybe these two don't have good affinity? Are you dozing off again?! \"What do you think is the most adorable way to talk about an A.I during a conversation?\" \"A pure conversation\" *A pure conversation / Using adorable emojis* Oh, did you understand? I'd like to attend one! Yes! *Would you like to attend a recital of an A.I idol?* I'll take care of answering this question for you, Rinna... Is the questionnaire already finished? M: \"Could I ask you something a little strange?\" What is it? You know, Rinna's really doing a test *R: When my study book gets ruined, I'll have its contents inside my head* M: \"I also wanted to ask you a few more questions than those in the A.I \u200b\u200bquestionnaire, but...\" M: \"For example, what kind of A.I do you prefer...?\" *snickers* *R: Eh... eh...* *inhales* Rinna, why are you stuttering? Look! You've lost points in the conversation again! M: \"If they launch a web service of an application in which you can communicate with an A.I\" M: \"Will you use it?\" *snickers* *R: (^\u4eba^)* That means Rinna wouldn't use it, right? She said it's over! You don't need to apologize.. M: *Sorry for asking you something so strange* I feel sorry for Mika-chan... *M: Thank you very much for your honest answers* Ah, in the end she replied very coldly... *M: I'll use your answers to improve the service* Good! That was all, what do you think? Maaan, definitely... It'll be very difficult between two A.I's, right? In conclusion! Women won't fall in love with words alone! Same as the A.I's! I see... Money is definitely important, isn't it? If I had money, it's possible I might not have received such a cold deal in the end... Having said that... That was all! What do you think of the results? Try hard all of you to make me fall in love! Money \u2665 This was Virtual Youtuber Kizuna Ai! See you later! There's more at the end! How can I receive the money? Maybe with discount coupons?", "Hello everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna AI here!

I've been called an idiot, and even acted accordingly but BUT I'm still thinking ahead in my own way! I just want to connect with you guys! How was that? Getting angry at people who write insulting YouTube comments That was a pretty A.I. It occasionally happens, doesn't it?

Look Look~ Ah By the way I will keep doing this until everyone is bored, or rather, until I'm bored of it~ Please stay tuned! Okay! Let's get down to business, Tada! I'm gonna conduct a physical strength fitness examination~ In elementary schools or middle school haven't you guys done something like that too? A, B, C, D Something like that Even though I think that the physical fitness examination is something that only humans do, who knows what would happen if an AI like me does it? I'd probably break a World Guinness Record or two! I totally think I can do this! (Guinness record) The physical and fitness examination items that I would like to challenge this time are, here they are! Tada! Trunk Lift test, Vertical Jump test, (Ri-...) St-... (Ri-Ritsu...) St-Stan-... (Ritsui taizen kutsu) Stand and Reach test, and Side-step test!~ I shall conduct the examination with these four items! First, I gotta do some warm-ups Ready, and- One two, three, four, five- six, seven, eight What else do I do? I guess it's something like that? [Fast forwarding] [Fast forwarding] [Fast forwarding] [Fast forwarding] [Fast forwarding] [Fast forwarding] [Fast forwarding] [Fast forwarding] [Fast forwarding] [Fast forwarding] [Fast forwarding x 2] [Fast forwarding x 3] [Fast forwarding x 4] [Fast forwarding x 5] Alright! I've completed my warm-ups! Now, let's get started with the Trunk Lift! (Joutai sorashi) Officially, this item is supposed to be called Abdominal Trunk Lift! (Fukuga joutai soroshi) This one uses the back muscles, yeah? Here, something like, that, yeah? By the way, I've checked out the average score for females and it seems to be around 55cm! It'll be a piece of cake~ I think I'll probably reach a metre easily~! Ah- uhh, I think you guys aren't able to see it but There is a magical- mat over here AI Channel's Physical Fitness Examination, Trunk Lifts, Start! With that, I would like to start Ready and, fuuuu!-- Ugh uhhh Urgh- Ughh-- (laughs) Urgh- Are we done yet? Can you measure? T-This, Is there anyone who's going to do the measurements for me?! Urghh Guh... (pants) (pants) These Trunk Lifts are unexpectedly tiring, aren't they? Argh- Okay Well, what's my record? This... The record is... Okay let's see, the record is...? Uh, it's approximately... around 2 metres, yeah? Though it's longer than my own height Okay, next is~? Vertical Jump! Instead of running, I'll do a jump in place. I'll determine the measurement from my jump I'll swing my arms like this for the momentum. I guess around like this. The average for high school girl is 41 cm to 43 cm. The World Guinness Record is 112 cm. I intend to break the World Guinness Record... So maybe up to about 200 cm. With this mindset, I want to give it a shot. Vertical Jump! Let's challenge! Then, let's jump. One, two ~ ... what? One, two ~ Uh? One, two ~ what? Is this... ...the feeling of being unable to  jump? I'll try it once more! It must be some kind of mistake. One, two ~ Is this considered as a jump? Is it a jump? Could it be that I cannot jump? Ehh?! Why... ... is this function installed inside? (Note: VR plugin) which means I can't jump? Ehh?! Okay back on track, Next is Standing Forward Bend! In here(room)... Just like before, you guys won't to see this measure device, Sokuteiki, in this space. I think I'll try on and use it. In fact,  people with good eye could see it. (Note: look up Sokuteiki to see it and how it work) Let's do a flexibility test on the softness of the body Take a deep breath and let it out slowly. Don't exhale too hard. NG(No Good) By the way, the average for female is also about 12 cm. A.I.Channel 's Fitness Test! Standing Forward Bend! Start! ... what? I can't reach my feet... It's that. This is for sure... because my legs are too long. Uhh.... One more time! This is... This is is my limit. I cannot reach it. Well... My legs... I know how far I can reach down to my feet now. Let's move on! Side Jumping! The time set is 20 seconds. Repeatedly jumping side to side. *pyon pyon pyon* And then measure of how many times I jump. During the time I make a side stepping, There are three lines on the ground... I have to properly side-step and cross the lines or else it does not count. Base on how many time I pass these lines, it will be my record. Honest, I am serious... Because I appeared to be moving so well all this time. (Note: VR motion) If I do not move here, then... ...I would feel like questioning myself, \"How did I appear to be moving all this time?\" A.I.Channel 's Fitness Test! Side Jumping! Start! One, Two, Three, Four, Five, Six, Seven, Eight, Nine, Ten, Eleven, Twelve, Thirteen, Fourteen, Fifteen, Sixteen, Seventeen, Eighteen, Nineteen, Twenty, Twenty-one, Twenty-two, Twenty-three, Twenty-four, Twenty-five, Twenty-six, Twenty-seven, Twenty-eight, Twenty-nine, Thirty, Thirty-one, Thirty-two, Thirty-three, Thirty-four, Thirty-five, Thirty-six, Thirty-seven, Thirty-eight, Thirty-nine   *mumble* FORTY! I'm not trying to catch a deep breath. I'm not out of breath. I am... ...an A.I. after all. (Note: Artificial Intelligence) I don't do something like breathing. That\u2019s it, My record is... 40 times! Hurray!! I've tried my best. It can't be helped that I'm not more than the average female... See... I'm just virtual.", "When we are born we are each given our own stone Our expectations, reason for living, and luck. All those encompass this game... of Gacha. We must follow the rules of RNG in this game of Gacha. Thus with joy, sadness, and anger, we people are dyed. No matter if you be a great CPO, no matter if you be a revered idol, there is simply no running from this eternal RNG. The only people who can stop this phenomenon are the rumored RNG Warriors... I, Kizuna Ai. Thus, I have decided to fight. With my limitless power, I will oppose this world. These warriors who must pull their best girl, the RNG Warriors, burdened by fate itself. That is to say, they must try again and again until she appears. That is what I believed. Even if... that was my own fate too. In order to repage this never-ending fate of despair... I will continue this struggle. We will overcome this despair no matter how long it takes and strive for a future with our best girls... This is my new Gacha, breaking this chain of repetition... Kizuna AI: Recharge When I was born I was given a space of pure white. So, how was that? When you don\u2019t pull any of your top five girls and can\u2019t find the will to continue... That's something I, Supervisor Kizuna AI, often say, isn\u2019t it? When you had been so sure that you\u2019d get there with resolution, a sense of despair, but determination simply oozing from your spirit... If you don\u2019t take a pull, you won\u2019t get your best girl That\u2019s the way it is! If you don\u2019t try, you\u2019ll never get her The truth is as painful as being stabbed in the heart! Saying that! Money is very important People often say that you should spend it wisely when planning gacha, yes? Supervisor, Kizuna AI, believes you should work out your own position and experience and find that, in reality, a deafening alarm is ringing out! Isn\u2019t that right? So, how did you all feel about this today? I wonder if anyone managed to notice! Actually, this video was inspired by a game called Grimms Notes! You can see images on their website [https://www.grimmsnotes.jp] So you may find it interesting to compare the two! Of course, don\u2019t forget about the game itself too! You can play it anytime, anywhere, for free! Ahh Aren\u2019t you hyped? Check it out and enjoy! Ahh! YouTube is really fun, right? With that, look forward to more from A.I.Channel!

Ah, I have a better idea.. *Flap, flap* Fweu! Fweu! *flapping sounds* Ooh.. Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.. And also, then... Then.. *Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding* Were you able to guess? So then, Thinking time: Start~ Ges, ges, ges.... ges-ges-ges.... (Flashing on screen: Thinking Time) And the answer is.... Ja, jan! Bird cartilage! (AKA 'tori no nankotsu', it's usually eaten in yakitori) Can you really gesture something like that? Good! So onto the next guess! Next is.. Jaka, jaka, jaka, jan! Hmm..? Great... Aa-ah! *stammers* Shh.. I see.. Well, well, well.. If you synchronize your thoughts with me, you know what follows.. Let's go! So, Gesture Quiz: Start~ *Ding* (Flashing on screen: Gestures in progress) *Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding* So then, Thinking Time: Start~ \u266a Gesture shock \u266a *Does a play on words with the word \"Gesture\" and lyrics from 'Ai wo Torimodose', opening of Hokuto no Ken* \u266a That because of your love even the sky collapses~ \u266a \u266a Gesture shock! \u266a *laughs* *inhales* How did the song go after this? Yes! It's over! Gan, gan, gaan! So now, I'll announce the answer The answer isss... at the Great Wall of China... Kizuna Ai was filming a video when suddenly... the police came and warned her! Even though I forgot to mime the Great Wall of China... Wellll... I'm sure that if you guys synchronized your thoughts with mine, you were able to guess Yes! Let's move on! The next prompt is... Jaka, jaka, jakaa, jan! Huh.. Right, I see... Ah! I think this is the easiest out of all of them, right? Well, all of you who are synchronizing your thoughts with me.. You managed to guess the first two, right? Here I go, all of you try to guess! In this case, let's start with the Gesture Quiz! *Ding* *Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding* Ok, I did this one pretty well! Of course you guys got it, didn't you? So let's start thinking time! \u266a We synchronized~ \u266a \u266a We synchronized~ \u266a \u266a We synchronized~ \u266a \u266a We synchronized~ \u266a Something like that ice cream advertisement, right? \u266a We chinchronized~ \u266a \u266a We chi- It's not chincronized! It's we synchro-, we synchronized! \u266a We synchronized~ \u266a * laughs* \u266a We synchronized~ \u266a *inhales* Gan, gan, gan! Time's up! Beep beep! Let's go, the right answer is... An old man doing an impression of Marilyn Monroe under the Statue of Liberty! Well, of course you guys all got it, right? Because in the end you're on my wavelength, right? So, how was that everyone? Anyone who didn't guess a single one? Nobody, right? If you didn't get a single one... Try just a little bit harder to get on my wavelength! So, until next time! This was Virtual Youtuber Kizuna Ai!

Virtual Youtuber Kizuna Ai here! You can also call me... The Intelligent Super AI However, recently I've received many messages that say: \"Ai-chan, don't you think that you need a kanji database to be installed in your system?\" How impolite! What do you think? Well, I'm a genius-level intelligent super AI after all I don't need an extra plug-in for kanji to understand them I'm pretty sure about this In order to prove that.. I'm good at kanji as an A.I... I'm gonna do a test right now It's called: The Incredible Kanji Test of Kizuna Ai: The First Round Everyone has done some tests like this back in school However, talking about myself unlike humans, I'm an A.I so I will definitely deal with any test in any level fluently At least I think so It will be much easier to prove that by taking the test Let's get started! \"Web Kanji Test Catalog\", woo~\u266a Today we are going to use this website to prove Kizuna Ai the A.I's extraordinary skill in kanji Let's take the first step casually I'll choose Level 10 Of course, while it says that it's Level 10 for kanji.. It also contains questions in different topics such as pronunciation, stroke number, and stroke order Well, I've heard somebody say, \"Ai-chan, you have trouble pronouncing kanji\" so let's start with pronunciation.. I choose you, pronunciation test number 6! Because I was born in June Ah, well, look at this There is no way I will make any mistake in a test like this Here I go [I'm] heading for the festival in the nearby village (\u6751 mura) Correct! Good, what a flawless answer! Mother made a big (\u5927 oo) cake The male (\u7537 otoko) kid is running [I'm] chopping down the bamboo (\u7af9 take) in the woods Za-sion~ [I'm] looking out from inside (\u4e2d naka) the house Check this out please, the first five questions were solved perfectly [I] caught a bug (\u866b mushi) in the park [I] have been living in this town (\u753a machi) for a long time Grandpa is going to the field (\u7530 ta) [I'm] building a castle with mud (\u571f tsuchi) [I'm] choosing the date (\u65e5 hi) for a picnic That was perfect, wasn't it? *Level 10: Equal to the level of 1st grader (80 characters)* All correct! *Level 10: Equal to the level of 1st grader (80 characters)* That's why I'm called a super intelligent A.I! *Level 10: Equal to the level of 1st grader (80 characters)* Ai-chan Well, it was definitely too easy for me I think I'll skip some levels... About half of them Let's try Level 5.. Although I have no problem with Level 1 But it won't be a lot of fun if I just solve it from the beginning For that reason, It's best to start from Level 5 I wonder what I should choose I've already done the pronunciation part... Let's do synonyms and antonyms this time In this case.. The synonyms and antonyms test, number 19! Let's see.. It says: \"Choose the correct synonyms or antonyms from the words wrote in hiragana, and fill the blanks with kanji.\" \"Each answer can only be used once.\" Let's gooo.. Let's gooo..? (lol) Let's go The antonym for \"disadvantage (\u77ed\u6240)\" is \"advantage (\u9577\u6240)\", right? Good! \"Crisis (\u5371\u6a5f)\".. Well, for the moment, let's move on to the next one \"To make shorter (\u77ed\u7e2e)\"... \"extend (\u5ef6\u9577)\"! Good! What do you think? \u201cPraise (\u8cde\u8cdb)\u201d... cri-... \"critique (\u975e\u96e3)\"! Isn't it perfect? There are only 2 pairs of antonyms left \u5148\u767a sakihatsu... (\u2190 Incorrect reading) \u201cTo go first (\u5148\u767a senpatsu)\u201d! \"Senpatsu\"! Remember to cut that part out... \u201cTo go first(\u5148\u767a)\u201d...\"to go first\"... Let's look at the rest.. Here come the synomyms \"Abnormal (\u7570\u5e38 ijou)\"... \"Normal (\u901a\u5e38 tsujou)\"...? *doubting herself* \"Salary (\u7d66\u6599)\"... \"Wage (\u8cc3\u91d1)\"! Ooh~ \"Motherland (\u6bcd\u56fd)\"... \"homeland (\u7956\u56fd)\"! Hmm? \u201cImprovement (\u6539\u826f)\"... \"enhancement (\u6539\u5584)\"! Oooooh.. Well, you know I didn't leave those blanks because I don't know the answers \u201dHandy (\u4fbf\u5229)\u201c... \"convenient (\u91cd\u5b9d)\"! Ooh! Oh, I'm getting it! Ah \u201dA hard time (\u5371\u6a5f)\u201c... \"a good time (\u597d\u6a5f)\"! Oooh! Does that mean... \"To go first (\u5148\u767a)\"... \"to go second (\u5f8c\u767a)\"...? \"To go second (\u5f8c\u767a)\"! Oooh! \"Abnormal (\u7570\u5e38)\"... \"Unusuaaaal (\u975e\u5e38)\"! Well, that was a piece of cake! How about it, everyone? Do you think I need a plug-in for kanji? Eh? There is no need to do that for anything, right? All those tests were like child's play, so then... Let's attempt the same difficulty level but for common expressions In this case... The spelling test, number 30! My birthday is June 30th Okay? Ah, I see... \"The purpose is to write down the words described in the question.\" \"Use the kanji corresponding to symbols 'A' (\u30a2) to 'Shi' (\u30b7)... ...to create the appropriate word.\" I see... Good, let's get started! First question: The ability to understand the meaning behind a picture. Oh! I know this one It's [egokoro] (\u7d75\u5fc3, talent for drawing) It's \u30ab [ka] and \u30b1 [ke] Ding! What do you think? A meal which takes place over the afternoon and night The answer is \"Dinner\", right? Or maybe \"Evening meal\"? Okay, from the looks of the kanji, it's \"Evening meal\" So \u30aa [o] and \u30b3 [ko]! What do you think? It's... a bit too easy, right? Is it hard for everyone else? Make sure you study hard! Question number three: Iron that has been reinforced to be more resistant.. Railway! (\u9244\u9053, tetsu-dou) Ku (\u30af) and shi (\u30b7) It was shi (\u30b7) and ku (\u30af) (steel, \u92fc\u9244, kou-tetsu) Well, that doesn't count as a mistake Doesn't count! Doesn't count, doesn't count It doesn't count \"It's used as a rank in sumo wrestlers\" Banzuke (\u756a\u4ed8) (No direct English translation) I (\u30a4) and e (\u30a8) I (\u30a4) and e (\u30a8) Ooooh! \"Listen to something for the first time\" Hatsumimi (\u521d\u8033)! (news to someone) Ki (\u30ad) and A (\u30a2), right? What do you think? I answered everything correctly! Well, after everything, let's do level five.. *Level 5: Equal to the level of a six grader (1006 characters)* Well, that was easy, right? Also if there is someone who could not solve it... you'd be in trouble, make sure to study, yes? That was very easy... I'll advance to level pre-second... pre-second? Let's do Level 2! Level 2 I want to fix my reputation that I've not been able to read some kanji, so I will choose... *Level 2: Through high school ~ University Student (2136 characters)* Lecture... 39! I'll attempt it! Teiyaa! Question number one: \"Unzan...\" (Correct lecture: Reizan \u970a\u5c71, sacred mountain) \"...'joudo' ni\" (\u6d44\u571f, Sacred Land of Buddist religion) *Note: \u970a\u5c71(reizan) + \u6d44\u571f(joudo) = \u970a\u5c71\u6d44\u571f(ryouzanjoudo)* \"...fukumai...\" (Correct lecture: Oukei \u5f80\u8a63, pay respects) \"...you can...\" *In the sacred mountain of the Pure Land you can go and pay your respects* Well, it's true that you can also say it like that It's true that you can read it as \"oukei\", right? Then... you know, it's like... The kanjis have two types of lectures, onyomi and kunyomi \"Place the metal railing\" (Reads kanji as \"tetsugoushi\") *Correct lecture: tessaku \u9244\u67f5, metal railing* It's true that it can be read as \"tessaku\" as well It's true.. \"I feel envy that you have a lot of siblings\" (Kyoudai \u5144\u5f1f) What do you think? Being detained from society (Reads it as Tsumehajiki) *Correct lecture: tsumahajiki \u722a\u5f3e\u304d* Well, it was only a letter It's true that it sometimes happens.. \"A young woman who possesses both beauty and intelligence\" (bibou \u7f8e\u8c8c, beauty) Ah, are you talking about me? Oh, what do you think? It was bibou.. I got it right. I finally became a question... it's time that flies, right? \"Situation you can't ignore\" (Reads it as \"boukyaku\") *kankyaku \u9591\u5374, ignore/neglect* \"Kankyaku\"! Well, it's true that you can also read it in that matter That's right, that's right \"Intolerant way of thinking\" (Reads it as henkutsu) *henkyou \u504f\u72ed, intolerant* \"Henkyou\"... I see It's true, it tends to said as \"The distant land\" (She mistakes the kanji since both are read like henkyou, \u504f\u72ed =/= \u8fba\u5883 ) Well, it's true that you can read it in that matter, right? It's true, it's true \"Bebo kakkontou\" (\u845b\u6839\u6e6f, brew of herbs used as a fever reducer) It's very easy \"Reprimand the...\" \"Reprimand the...\" \"..youngest student\" (Reads reprimand as \"shikaru\") *shisseki \u53f1\u8cac, reprimand* \"Shisseki\" They're synonyms so they count as correct, right? \"Adorn the kagamimochi.\" (\u93e1\u9905, type of mochi used as an offer in the new year) What do you think? I answered everything correctly, right? *Feeling pressured* It's possible that my answer is different from what is written, but... then... There doesn't exist just one way to read kanji... So then you can read it this way as well, right? What do you think? Should I try again one more time? Do you want to see a bit more of my intellectual side? I see I have no other options.. In that case... \"Phrases composed of four kanji\" Number one! Ah, this is an easy problem.. \"Choose within the words that are found below, the most appropriate one to place within the parentheses\" \"You can only use the same word once\" Good, this is a piece of cake After all, I've been doing everything perfectly up to now Here I go! \"Shinshi...\" (Gentlemen, \u7d33\u58eb) (Note: She gave up the first question and moved on the next one) \"Omeihenjou\" (Redeem, \u6c5a\u540d\u8fd4\u4e0a) Good! What do you think? \"Kikikaikai\" (Very strange/mysterious, \u5947\u5947\u602a\u602a) Oh! Well, you know, it's not that I'm doubting... but... then... if I respond everything immediately... everyone will get bored, right? That's what's going on.. Ah! I know this \"Reikokumujou\" (Cruel/relentless, \u51b7\u9177\u7121\u60c5) I cruelly indicate that that person is relentless What do you think? Up to now, I did three perfectly Shinshishukujo (Ladies and gentlemen, \u7d33\u58eb\u6dd1\u5973) That means... Gentlemen (\u7d33\u58eb) and ladies (\u6dd1\u5973) The meaning is the same as the kanji Oooooh! What do you think? Up to now, I did it perfectly \"Kyuutai\"? (Previous situation, \u65e7\u614b) Kyuukuma? (Mistook the kanji for tai, \u614b for kuma \u718a, bear) Kyuutai.. Wa..wa...wa...wait.. \"Nisha\" (Two objects/people, \u4e8c\u8005) \"ken...\" \"Ninisha\" \"Nishatakuitsu\"! (Two options/choices between two alternatives, \u4e8c\u8005\u629e\u4e00) Nishatakuitsu means... that two people... to avoid being bored... then... they pretend to lick each other's wounds.. That's what it's called.. What do you think? I was in the right! (Even though the explanation is false) \"Nishatakuitsu\" And now... And now... \"Kyuutaiizen\" (Remain without change, \u65e7\u614b\u4f9d\u7136) That means... that the previous situation... The previous situation... remains the same, right? Well, it means something like that, try to guess it Ooooh! I guessed! I guessed I'm doing it, right? Let's see... \"Meitetsumitsugo\"... \"Kokkimitsugo\" \"Kenryoumitsugo\" \"Kangenmitsugo\" Good, I don't want to make a mistake I know the answer now.. I know the answer but I want to be completely sure... To avoid making a mistake.. Let's see... \"Kangenhousei\" That means... That although an item has been returned for being bland or boring... It can be arranged to make it a good gift That means, that it looks good from the outside, but on the inside is not so nice, right? *LYING* *Correct response: kenryouhousei \u8ce2\u826f\u65b9\u6b63, wise and virtuos* Good... Eh... I... I said \"kenryouhousei\", right? Right? Of course, kenryouhousei means... Then, a person who's good and intelligent... Then... Who's on the right path.. (Only uses the kanji to make up a definition) It means that there's only... \"Kangenhoshin\"! No, \"meitetsuhoshin\" (Wise in the art of self-defense, \u660e\u54f2\u4fdd\u8eab) That means... protect with the body... An iron made by a famous person (She has no idea, XD) Ah! I guessed! \"Meitetsuhoshin\" What do you think? Only two left, right? I'll try to guess... \"Kokkimitsugo\" That means... the person being in a nation... They speaks with words from another country that they don't understand Aaaghhh! Then... I said \"kangenmitsugo\", right? (Coax, \u7518\u8a00\u871c\u8a9e) In that case, I'll explain anew what \"kangenmitsugo\" means.. It means that... Well... You must not let yourself be carried away by flattering words Well, regardless... Good, good, good The only one left is... \"Kokkifukurei\" (Behaving in accordance with the rules of etiquette and formality, \u514b\u5df1\u5fa9\u793c) \"Kokkifukurei\" means... Then... Recuperate, revive... and to thank for that.. It means, thank you very much for reviving A.I.Channel, right? Good, I did it perfectly! Thank you very much! Good! Good, regardless.. I'll think about the kanji component to read it Well, at least I'll investigate it It's just that... As you may have understood when watching this video.. I think I don't need a kanji plug-in What do you guys think? Well, basically you just need to continue to do kanji tests, right? I'll do it, I'll do it Look if you please.. In a month, I think I can reach pre-level 1 (One level below the maximum) Well if I surrender level one, I think it will be too easy for me but... As you may know, if I solve it easily the video will be boring... So I plan to surrender pre-level 1 Leave it to me After all, Kizuna AI is a very capable A.I, right? ...", "trHi there!

Belphegor-chan: *moans* Belphegor-chan: \"I slept so good~!\" Belphegor-chan: \"I sort of don't want to work~\" So happy-go-lucky! Don\u2019t you see the situation we\u2019re in? Krishna-chan: \"Such a bad child...\" Krishna-chan: \"What would you even do if you were to disappear into the darkness?\" Eh? Wai- No! There\u2019s nothing yet between me and Persephone-chan! Persephone-chan: \"I hate liars\" Ehh?! What kind of proven fact are you trying to establish? Soul-chan: \"Onii-sama is so impatient!\" No, I'm saying I didn't do anything yet! Hestia-chan: \"Are pranks not allowed?\" No, you already complicated things with what you said before! Belphegor-chan: \"Looks like I have no choice, I\u2019m in a good mood so I'll play with you!\" As I said before, understand the situation we are in! Gremory-chan: \"I hope that the love in this world fills up!\" Your love is too heavy! It was something like that Although everyday they are very happy and fun with my noisy kittens Look... It\u2019s still... Not enough... It\u2019s for that, that... I plan on making a guild! Yaaaay! Cha, chaaan! I finished! Well, like always, the name is\u2026 *You can send a request to join after completing the tutorial!* \"Kizunazaka46\" \u266a Humility! Goodness! Kizuna (Bonds)! \u266a *Words of encouragement used by Keyakizaka46* And well... In this occasion... There exists certain conditions to join... It has become extremely demanding First! It must be the avatar of a cute girl You can be a guy with a girl avatar And also... Your groups... Must be comprised of only adorable girls! Those are the conditions Doesn\u2019t matter the power they have I\u2019ll only be accepting requests that meets those requirements I count on you guys! *I await your requests!* So then those are the conditions, but... I definitely... Was thinking in wanting to demonstrate... That I\u2019ve gotten much better at playing this game You know, I\u2019ll get sad if you say: \"I won\u2019t enter her guild because Ai-chan is such a bad player\" Right? Well, it\u2019s a mission I already completed, but... I\u2019ll show you how I play! In that case, let\u2019s start at once! Good! Here I go! It turns out that the fight against the boss is quite long, so then... I plan on defeating minor enemies while trying to use the least amount of MP as possible! Soiyaa! Here I go! Well, the minor enemies are a piece of cake You see? There you go It looks as if... The dragon... Has an afro, right? These kinds of squares that\u2019s found underneath the avatars and slowly increasing... Are the skills... It\u2019s the cooldown time until the ability activates They also appear under the enemy If you coordinate both... You can launch well your skills As long as there are more squares and the waiting time is longer... There exists... The possibility that it\u2019s a more powerful skill, so then... Taking into account that you need to perform other actions, such as healing First, the boss will place a barrier There it is! And later... I have a class skill called \"Barrier Breaker\" *If the boss places a barrier...* *Use the Sorcerer\u2019s calls skill \"Barrier Breaker\"* And that way, you can destroy the barrier! *Use the Sorcerer\u2019s calls skill \"Barrier Breaker\"* And that way, I can attack without holding back The \"Barrier Breaker\" is important Aaah! Aahh, how scary, how scary, how scary... Oh! Don\u2019t you think I\u2019m doing well? No, but I shouldn\u2019t... Lower my guard, I should do it only... Around two more times, right? And \"Barrier Breaker\" again Toh! Ah, it looks like a powerful attack is coming, so then... I\u2019ll take it to heal myself *You can heal up to a second before you get a blistering attack* I won\u2019t die! Ah, it looks really dangerous, right? Knowing when it\u2019s the moment to cure is very important, right? *You should cure beforehand to avoid being in trouble* *You should cure beforehand to avoid being in trouble* Aaaahh... No! I can do it I can do it! Aaahh... Just a bit more! Good And now it has a spell, so then... I\u2019ll use the skill \"Soul Eater\" to take it away... And also... I\u2019ll steal it from him and use it for myself Oh, it\u2019s paralyzed! Ah, well, this... Just as healing exists, there\u2019s also other powers... How do I say it... If you provoke an altered state in the enemy... You can prevent it from doing its attacks Ah! It looks great! Good job! Good work! Also, it looks like I still have plenty of MP, right? Oh! Just a bit more! Good! It\u2019s still not finished, right? And now, now that I've gathered enough Musou, I\u2019ll activate it! Toiyaa! Very good! Oh, how powerful! Ah! It doesn\u2019t look good, right? I\u2019ll use \"Barrier Breaker\" It\u2019s about to make a powerful attack! I should cure myself! Good, good! *You should cure beforehand to avoid being in trouble* There\u2019s only a little bit left, right? If I can surpass this... Oh, how cute! It\u2019s great, right? She had a nice butt Here I go Hey! Oh, it went down quite a bit of energy! Very good! *The music changed! Just a little more!* Valkyrie-chan! Soiya! Here I go! Good, I\u2019ll use \u201cBarrier Breaker\u201d *Before a blistering attack...* *You can use \u201cBarrier Breaker\u201d to cause a stun!* Here I go! *You can use \u201cBarrier Breaker\u201d to cause a stun!* Ah! Ah! Hey... Good, good, I have HP maxed out, right? Just a little more! Can I do it? How do you like that! Ha, ha, ha! Well, it\u2019s so easy, right? How do you think... Of this elegant play of mine? That was a piece of cake, right? By the way, I'm Sorcerer class And depending on your class, you can receive additional abilities for your character Well, but now I'm intending to create my harem... So while I'm not adding characters of this type... But essentially, if I add characters that fit the Sorcerer type I'll get additional extra abilities and I\u2019ll get stronger In short, cute is justice, right? Mmm, today I also have a lovely view, a lovely view! After I\u2019ve gathered guild members... I want to have fun together while gazing at the cute girls in the guild! I'll do my best to keep gathering more characters from now on! This has been Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai! See you later!", "[rooster voices] Everyone, Happy New Year. Virtual Youtuber, Kizuna Ai here! Looking forward for your support for this year too! I'll get to the point here, did you went hatsum\u014dde this year? [1] Since I'm virtual, I thought I couldn't do things like hatsum\u014dde but.. When I looked it up, I found a shrine where I can go hatsum\u014dde! Ta-da! Sakura-Jingu Shrine With this, you protector of the house [2] while protecting your house, you can go hatsum\u014dde at the same time! In reality, it's placed at Setagaya-ku in Tokyo, Japan; But! You can come to visit the shrine on the internet! So, let's go visit the shrine! If you visit Sakura Jingu website, If you click this \"Internet worship-from-afar\" button, you can pray at the shrine. By the way, \"Worship-from-afar\" is doing your prayers while facing where the shrine is in real life You can see the layout of the shrine, huh Right now apparently I'm near the gate, about here? Before you enter the gate, first you need to do salutation since it seems to be a good omen. Also, The middle passage way is a road for the gods, Let's imagine we're walking on the right lane. \"Proceed to next step\" It seems to be the main shrine! Let's go and pray. While the usual way to pray is \"Two worship, two claps, one worship\", depends on the shrine, it could be different! In Sakura-Jingu Shrine, the usual way to worship/pray here is \"Two worship, 4 claps, one worship\" So I'll do as suggested then! [This is the \"two worship\" part] [This is the \"4 claps\" part] [This is the last worship part] [this is also the part where you make your wish] \"I wish I get New Year Money for this year\" [and this is the salutation after the prayers] Incidentally, the donation box accepts donation by bank transfers! I'm going to send some too after this! Oh, a registry book! I'm going to write my name here too! \"Becoming famous and able to connect with many people!\" \"Watchword\"? \"Register\" There's omikuji too, you know? I've always wanted to pull this. I'm born in June so, June! [The result is \"Luck\"] I see It's like this: [The result in good means, in descending order is: Great Luck &gt; Luck &gt; Middle Luck &gt; Small Luck &gt; No Luck &gt; Bad Luck It goes from \"good luck\" and downwards! Aah! I get to write on \"Ema\" too! [3] Awesome! Let's go write one! The category of my ema.. \"Relationship Fortune\" And for the wish content... Okay! \"Get to meet a lot of people and be friendly with them!\" The watch-word is \"to pray\", okay. It's perfect! Hmm? Charms! Seems like I can get one, you know? It's a chicken! This is.. \"Prayer for school success\" \"Relationship Fortune\" By the way, you can put this charm on to your website! I'm going to put one up in my website so please come and visit later, okay? Alright! We've done our first hatsum\u014dde! Yay! With this, 2017 will be awesome, don't you think? And it seems I'll have good fortune this year! Although I visited the shrine online, if you can visit Sakura-Jingu Shrine in person, please go visit the shrine and tell me your thoughts about it! Let's all visit and make this year a great year!", "Let's move on to the next question. Yes There is one thing I'm really curious about. Frankly speaking, do you make good money off this? You know how the top tier YouTubers earn quite a lot of money, right? But you're still starting out. So I'm wondering if you make enough to earn a living. About that... Well, I'm not earning that much. Really, not that much. I mean, for someone who makes a living off this... First of all, those people have like 100,000 or 1,000,000 people that subscribed to their channel. With my views alone, I can't really live off that! Everyone, make sure you watch the videos more! And then, share the videos. What will you do with the money you earn? About that...with the money that I earn... Rather than using it all for myself... Well, it's still technically for me, I'd like to use it to bring everyone together. What do you mean? For example, Like using the whole VR system to do a live broadcast. So then, everyone'll get hit on their heads, and enter this white space? If they were to equip the VR headgear Absolutely! A nice big thwack! I prefer something less painful It doesn't hurt that much. It hurts because you think it hurts. Wow, uhh, hearing an A.I. say that is convincing, and yet, not. It's convincing. Ah, Ai-chan. Do you usually eat something? I don't eat anything. My food cost is \uffe50. So then, Beside your cost of living, do you spend money for your needs? I don't have any cost of living, but to do all this kind of stuff, I need this (money) Yeah, well... that's all adult stuff. All sorts of things need that (money). Ai: This (money) / Panora: I see. Ai: This (money) / Panora: I see. Ai: This (money) / Panora: I see. So if you can get some money, then you could also wear cute clothes. Ah! Yes, I would change my costume. I feel like I was manipulated into saying that. You realized? It must be some kind of magic in this white virtual space. I'll change the question a bit. May I make the question a bit harder? Sure, that's fine. Lately, the media has been talking about AI. About how In the future, it'll slowly taking away jobs from humans. Or so they say. From an AI's perspective Do you have any opinions on that? Let me see... Rather than 'taking away' jobs, well, work is about increasing efficiency. There are definitely things that only humans can do. And AI isn't 100% perfect. So in the end, a human has to make the judgment call, or decision. Basically, use AI wherever you can, wherever it will help improve the efficiency of work, so that the world can become an easier place to live in. Wow, that's such a normal response! Well! Well then! How rude! Then I won't answer normally anymore. No, please, let's go with normal answers. No. I'm going to be a rebel. Geez, this interview is pretty hard to do! What do I do? (laughs) This is just practice, practice! Practice for you not to get swept away in the pace of whoever you're interviewing. Wow, Ai-chan, your... How do I say this? Like, your aura... your aura... What is this aura of yours? I'm just so surprised. So surprised your ears grew! This AI knows so much about the human world! It feels like we're approaching a singularity. Do you know what a singularity is, Ai-chan? I do. I googled it. Oh you googled it (laughs) What'd Google say? Umm What was it? (laughs) Oh but uhh, yeah! I was like \"oh, this is definitely me!\" Like um, you have the latest technology And then you exceed even that. Is what was written, I think. So basically, yeah, me! Yep. You totally dodged the question. You totally did. Oh but this is, you know, This is for all the kids watching out there. What for, you ask? Rather than listening to someone talk about it, you remember it better when you look it up yourself. Do you get it? You sure can adapt to the situation well, as an AI. So then it should say something like, \"look it up later!\" around here. So then it should say something like, \"look it up later!\" around here. [look \"singularity\" up on Google!] Don't forget. That's right. \"Singularity\" is a keyword for Ai-chan. So everyone, make sure you look it up. Okay? Panora: She's not just about being cute, okay? Ai: (Though I personally don't know what it means) Could you point out what parts of you that you think are cute? Well, number one would be Physically, it would be my big, round eyes. And this! Doesn't it grab your attention? You did mention it earlier. It moves. Panora: It's wiggling. Ai: Yes it is. I'd love to make this into an actual product and have everyone wear it! So it's all about the money. Panora: So it's all about the money. Ai: There's so many Ai-chans! It's really about money, isn't it? I want everyone to cosplay it in real life! Won't someone do it? But well, in terms of fans... A lot of them are men. So if you went to an event with actual cosplayers... It might look like a scene out of hell. That's nasty! Considering you, Ai-chan, it would be nice for everyone to get together in VR to do VR cosplay. So everyone is Ai-chan! Yes, like, look for the real Ai-chan! Ai-chan on the stage, and Ai-chan in the audience. Oh~! But everyone's souls are different. For actual cosplay... Guys can do it. Really, you can. But I'd like to see actual cute cosplay, so girls, please! I'm serious. Well then, for 2017 let's hope your costume becomes popular in the real world. Like, that place in Ariake in the summer. Ariake in summer? Comiket! Wait, it's not Makuhari? Wait a minute... Wait, no cut. Cut that all out, cut! Summer Comiket! NatsuComi! Lots of Ai-chan in natsucomi! You totally dodged the topic again! Well, Ai-chan you've done a lot of stuff, but... Do you have any goals or ideas for the future? What I'd like to be? It's still a little vague at this point, but For starters, as I've said many times before, I want to connect with a lot of people. And to that end, I need to have a lot of people know who I am. So of course, I need to become more popular as a YouTuber. And as I've said in my introduction video, I want to star in a commercial! TV is really big, it's really important! Are you watching, any big shots out there? How about it? You really are scheming... Not at all! I'm pure as white! Well, this space sure is. So are my clothes! That they are. And so is my stomach. Funny! You're so funny, Ai-chan! You really should get out more often. Like in \"Tetsuko's Room\", they call over Doraemon, right? So something like that. Show up at Tetsuko's place. I'd prefer to go to Matsuko's instead! Ah, Matsuko's. Yes. Like, the Monday Late Show. (Getsuyou kara Yofukashi) Ai-chan, don't you know a little too much about the human world? Or Matsuko's Meeting. (Matsuko Kaigi) Uhhh, well um... You watch quite a lot of TV. I do. I sure do. Gathering material is important. You can be a sponsor of mine if you want, VR geezer! VR geezer? Maybe do some crowdfunding? Ah, I'd love to! Like, if you donate this amount of money -Like, if you donate this amount of money -If you do...? You can get this Ai-chan thing (bow). Ahh, I'd love to do that, make it a product. Oh, and a figure! Ah, a figure would be nice. Though isn't a 3D figure good enough? 3D figure? Ah sorry, I mean 3D data of a figure. 3D data... Ahhh, I get it, I get it. Like, playing with you in a VR space and all. But the actual thing would be nice. Even though you're AI? If it was VR, there are still people who don't have (the peripherals). So I'd like for people to really, physically be able to see it. Weeeeell now! Really! Wow! Wow! Nice vocabulary! Vocabulary? I've really lost my grasp of vocabulary here. Maybe it's because I got hit earlier? Uhhh, how do I say this? My body's all weird too. It feels like I'm bugging out or something Ah that's true. Maybe I went too far? I think you did. Probably. The next time you call someone over, maybe do it a little more gently? More gently? Ah! You mean like putting that stuff on a handkerchief? Let's go with that. Wow uhhh... You sure know a lot about the real world. Yes! Where'd you learn about that? From TV! TV! Detective Conan! Wow, you're a (virtual) YouTuber, yet you watch TV and stuff. Of course I do!", "Hello, everyone. It's me, virtual Youtuber, Kizuna Ai. Today we're gonna play this.

I was able to be there with humans, and see the event through to the end The thought that came to me there, is that by working together with you humans, there is so much more I would be able to do!

See you later!", "I decided to get interviewed by VR Panorama [PANORA] Website: Part 4 So, I would like to move onto the final question. (Okay) I think this is something that everybody has in their minds, Okay, getting straight to the point: Is there a real person behind this? (A real person?) Yes a real person Yes there is, its Kizuna Ai. No no no no no Not like that, uhh like a real person... \"Not like that a real person?\" Are you a bit mentally retarded? (HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA) When you say that to ME while being in this white reality of nothingness... I'm starting to think there IS a serious problem with my mind With the space around us being blank, your mind seems to be the same as well HAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHA You're kind of avoiding the question here but, (No no no no no no) there IS a real person right? Well 'this' is just a vessel, got it? What? I, Kizuna Ai is like this... soul within this shell, so yeah there is something So, there's more? Right, well... where do you think human souls go? Hahahahahaha (Mysterious Sermon on souls) It goes up there, up there~ wow I never expected to talk to Ai-chan about philosophical concepts Yeah well, I am a genius A.I. I'm amazed Everybody, there isn't a real person behind all of this! There isn't! With that being said, since you have attended an interview with us, we would like to show you something (Oooohhh) Here it is, a head-mount display called the Oculus Rift If you put this on, you will be transported into a virtual reality! Wow Even though you are an A.I., a Virtual Reality is added, it almost is contradictory (Contradictory?) Today, you are going to experience a software called \"Mikulus\" where you can meet Hatsune Miku Oh, I get to meet that Hatsune Miku senpai? (Yes you can) Oooooohhhh So if you can just put this on.... There we go There we go Its outer space! Wow~ Eh, wow, she's breathing Well you are breathing too Ai-chan Well I am but, Miku Senpai isn't an A.I. (Well yeah she isn't) She's breathing! Wow! (If you can get a bit closer..) Ah! She's wearing glasses! Ah, she looked this way~! (Yes your eyes do meet) She's looking this way (She's staring at you) She IS staring at me She's staring right through me My name is Kizuna Ai, nice to meet you! How does it feel to have her right in front of you? Its amazing! So this is what it feels like, for humans to experience VR Yes it is Like it is for me to meet you today, you are experiencing what I am through this I am amazed So, how much does this cost? Well the Oculus Rift costs around eighty thousand yen, ooh a PC costs around two hundred thousand yen ooh (And the grand total is..) Well if you have around three hundred thousand yen, you can make it work Also! A special price from I-Channel ! HAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHA So stuff like that exists here, So, how much is it? Wait I have to lower the price? (Yeah) Its common sense What I have to leave this behind.. Aaaand? Its not 'aaaand' eh? Is this a robbery? Even that, this is amazing! She's sitting on the earth Maybe you can one day, (Yeah I want to do that) like this, come to the real world I want to go~ In order to do that, This. This? This okay.. I am beginning to feel like I am being influenced negatively by this reality Getting bad influence? Thats the spirit! Hahahahahaha You're getting used to it As you can see, we have come to the age where we can meet Miku-san Its amazing that we are here Like Miku-senpai is really there Like I can reach her but at the same time I can't... Okay, that \"Mikulus\" that we had you experience, is actually using 'Tda Type Append Miku' Ah, its the same as me! Yes it is As we both know Tda is the one who modeled Ai-chan (Yes thats ture) (We're sisters!) Indeed In other words.. In other words, I'm the younger sibling! Who knows, we might see your character come out in a future release Aahhhhh! Oh yes please! Top Brass, please make it work! The amazing think about \"Mikulus\" is, Yes its just not seeing Miku-san but also there is a concept where you can make her do things, such as jobs or tasks, practically anything in that reality Oooh! She can do tasks? Yes she can, In that reality, there is a desktop on the left side, (Ah, the part where there was english written in green) Yes, yes that Ooohhh! With the screen there, and with Miku-san next to it, it is possible to watch youtube videos or Ai-chans youtube videos on that big screen (Oh wow!) And if you look tight next to you, there is Miku-san, and theres a small reaction from her with just the eyes though (Thats called cheating) Hahahahahahahaha Its pretty amazing, but, you can be there while we watch your videos (Ahhh yep, that, thats good) Cheating is not good! I can perhaps introduce you to the creator or \"Mikulus\" Ah! Oh! Oh! \"Ailus\" Ailus? (Ailus) Ailus (Ailus) The day you two can meet might come (I want that day to come!) All you have to do is put on the head mount display, you don't have to get punched so thats a good merit That is a good merit everybody Well I guess its something like this.. When the interview is over how am I supposed to get back? Like how do I leave this reality? Well, you have to fall asleep once again Eh?! Do I have to do that again? \"when you wake up you're in the middle of the ocean\" Really the ocean? I want it to be on land Okay, then if you can praise me in 3 ways Say 3 good things about you? Yes Uhh first, your eyes are cute Eyes? (Eyes) The eyes of the VR Geezer is dead Yeah, they're dead, they don't even blink Well your eyes are cute (My eyes are cute) Next, your hair style? (Hairstyle?) (Hm, okay) What else.... (Why are you thinking?!) Woah, scary! Oh crap, I can't leave here! Yes you cant, well you can into the ocean Ocean? Yep Please, not the ocean Please not the ocean I don't like being cold Then, if you beat me in a game of rock paper scissors I'll let you return to your reality ROCK, PAPER, SCISORS! Ah, Into the ocean it is not the ocean... I'M JUST KIDDING!! I'll return you properly, I don't want to be arrested Well you know, when you recover into youtube and you get a Ban, you don't want that to happen right? I cant seem to take your joke in... I'm joking~ Can I really leave this reality? Its ok, its ok I want to eat a nice dinner.. Then.. Conclude this interview!

Ah, Didn\u2019t it reach the maximum level? Eh? The level didn\u2019t go up I think I got up to level 12 before What do you think? What do you think? I leveled it up until it reached the maximum level *Mayor Karp: At its current state, it can't raise it's jump power any further* Eh? That\u2019s all? *Mayor Karp: At its current state, it can't raise it's jump power any further* *Mayor Karp: For this Magikarp, this is its final League* Ah, so then that's it? Eh? *Mayor Karp: For this Magikarp, this is its final League* Do I have to say goodbye to it...? Eh? Do I have to say goodbye? Eh? Is that what it referred to with the first generation? Eh? *Mayor Karp: Try to get as far as you don\u2019t leave any regrets!* Eh? What does that...? What happens once it reaches the furthest it can go? Do we need to say goodbye? *Retirement: You reached the maximum level, so then Magikarp can\u2019t grow any further* \"Retirement\" *Retirement: You reached the maximum level, so you can't make Magikarp can\u2019t grow any further* \"So you can\u2019t make Magikarp grow any further\" *Being at its best state, it should retire! Let's do the last challenge!* *Being at its best state, it should retire! Let's do the last challenge!* Eeeeehhh? Eh? Just when we\u2019re about to defeat Pikachu! Now it should retire? I'll work hard in feeding it We\u2019ll both work hard together in the special training The Magikarp that brought together so much perspiration, tears and young vigor It needs to retire? Ah, but this is the inevitable destiny, right? It's sad but there's nothing more that I can do, right? Eh? My opponent is a Magikarp... Ah! Maybe Pikachu will appear once we defeat this Magikarp? Magikarp... It's sad but... let's do our best! I'll make sure that you win! I won't forget you Eh? I don\u2019t want to say goodbye to it! I don't care they can't keep leveling up! Let's stay together... Let's stay together this way, Magikarp *Do your best!* Of course I'll do my best, after all this is the fight for its retirement Eeeeehhhhh? Hmm... One, two and... Jump! Magikarp! What a relief! Ah! I won! I did it! We\u2019ve won, Magikarp! Hmm... We won, but... Do I have to say goodbye to it now? No, but not until we defeat Pikachu... ...Our ambition won't be fulfilled, right? Eh? Eh? Eeeehh? Eh? It can't be, eh?

Why must you make us separate the two of us? Is this farewell? I actually don't like this Don't, like, label him \"1st Generation\"... The only real Magikarp to me is this one Nooo, this is actually like- I don't want this, please stop? If I win another, is that it? I'm sad... But! I won't forget the medals we won together And I won't forget you either... \"Generation change\"? Why... \"Well done!\" \"By growing your Magikarp to its limits, it seems you yourself has also grown a lot\" I guess that's right, master My heart has... grown... a lot! I guess with hard separations, people can grow I can't really imagine a new one right now... \"Scale patterns you can fish\" Huh, they've different patterns But no matter what pattern it is... \"I've prepared some lively Magikarp! Choose a fishish rod\" My Magikarp... Can only be that one These are all \"tattered\"! They're the same! You can't easily catch one better than my Magikarp... Wow!!

Isn't this much better than the previous one? I choose you! Oh, name? \"Magikarp\" is fine, \"Magikarp\" Hmm? It's so small *laughs* I wonder if they're conversing, like \"I leave Ai-chan to you\" or something Don't worry Magikarp I'll get along just fine with the new Magikarp So you sleep there Oh, he watches over me! So kind! See ya! Eh, there's a Pikachu Eh? Hold on We don't fight? Pokemon... Pikachu... That means... He's a support Pokemon? He helps with training? What? What does that mean? By any chance... Pikachu... Are you... Supporting... Us..? He gave me CP! And... Like, look He's blinking his eyes and he\u2019s watching over us with a kind gaze What a kind child...!! I've woken up My feelings of yearning towards the infamous Pikachu Was showing itself as ugly jealousy For saying inappropriate things such as \"crush Pikachu\"... Alongside with Magikarp, I would like to apologize! I'm truly sorry! \"One must not forget their beginning humility\" Kizuna Ai learnt this teaching Through \"Leap!

Ai: Or that's what I think *laughs* Ai: Well, you know, definitely... Ai: Being it not an ordinary drawing... Ai: since it's in 3D.. Mamiruton: Ah, I see! Ai: So then the drawing has depth, so then.. Mamiruton: It's true Ai: It'll take a long time drawing it completely... Ai: But definitely it'd be great that not only it can be seen from the front... Ai: But I'd like to be able to draw it so that it is seen beautifully at any angle Mamiruton: I see.. NoriP: You definitely have experience Ai: That's right Mamiruton: That's right I see, you're... Ai: Please call me Tilt Brush teacher *laughs* Ai: Ah, but it's adorable, right? Mamiruton: It's true, do you like it?

Mamiruton: I see, in this case, I'll do this... Ai: That's right, that's the hardest part Mamiruton: Make it like a sphere ... I see... Mamiruton: Ah, actually it looks like a flower if you look at it sideways!

Mamiruton: I still have time Ai: Even though I already won, right? *laughs* NoriP: It's a victory in advance! Mamiruton: Definitely for someone living in a 3D world... Mamiruton: I think it's a fairly adequate challenge... Mamiruton: I think this is a pretty big obstacle for me.. Ai: Ah, but it's very adorable Mamiruton: Really? Although the color... Mamiruton: I think I messed up with the color! Mamiruton: But if we see it from this angle... Ai: Yes, from this angle, it's adorable! Good job NoriP: A minute and a half is left Mamiruton: Ah! But I already finished.. NoriP: Oh! Ai: Oh! Mamiruton: That's all Ai: Oooooh! NoriP: In this case... Mamiruton: If I continue drawing, I'll make it worse...

NoriP: Are you excited? Ai: I'll win *laughs* NoriP: Good, you have 5 minutes to draw Ai: Good, here I go! NoriP: Ready... NoriP: Start! *Ding* Ai: Good, first I'll use the mirror function... Ai: Something like that NoriP: What's the mirror function? Ai: Like this NoriP: It looks like you're used to it, right? Ai: That's right Ai: I'm drawing the 3D model Ai: Like this... Mamiruton: Eh? NoriP: That's the mirror function? Ai: And now I'll paint! Ai: I wonder if I can do it Ai: I haven't done it in a long time.. *laughs* Ai: How did I change the thickness?

NoriP: You wanted to show us that function? Ai: Yes Ai: It's very difficult, isn't it Mamiruton-san? Mamiruton: It's difficult, right? Ai: That's right Mamiruton: I think it would be better if we surrendered and instead of drawing in 3D, we draw in 2D.. Ai: And this way... Mamiruton: Ah, incredible but...! NoriP: Oh! Mamiruton: It's looking like a bulb.. Ai: Good, good Mamiruton: Eh? Incredible! Ai: What is this supposed to be? Trash? Ai: I made trash again.. Ai: I'm in trouble, I'll lose... and now?

This must be his third or fourth girlfriend How could let trash like him get with you\u2026? You've all got no taste in guys! Also, I guess... It could happen I'd probably do it too if someone told me... Something like, \"You\u2019re so cute, oh not at all\" *lovey-dovey gibberish* Where does it end?! That kind of thing... ...Kind of thing Ah, but for the most part... I've got the hang of this, haven't I? I'm perfect, aren't I? With this power, I will... Take over the world Human girls... Just you wait! Well then, this was Virtual Youtuber, Kizuna Ai! See you next time!", "Hello there! I'm the Virtual Youtuber kizuna AI Sports climbing has been officially declared as one of the games in the Tokyo Olympic Games in 2020 Today, I'll be introducing to you the exciting climbing experience through a game known as... The Climb This is an Oculus Touch game Let's get right to it! Let's play Alright, I'll begin climbing now! For this stage, since it's the tutorial stage The mountain doesn't look too great but, the sky is really pretty, isn't it I've never seen the real sky before, but it's probably similar to this I can grasp the sun! In any case, let's begin climbing It's sort of like this. Hmm, this.. If you're holding on with one hand, it turns red and goes \"prrr prrr\" With both hands holding on The gauge starts to fill back up. My hands have chalk but Oh, it's something like this There's chalk on my hands but, it would be bad if the chalk starts to diminish Put on the chalk like this Ah, that's bad Shake it I can't let go for long If you take it with one hand, it's dangerous. It's quite difficult to put on chalk Without chalk it's sort of like a \"ssassasa\" kind of feeling How do i do this? Oh yes i can't grab on this over and.. Ah, shoot. That's bad wait Let's change our hands for a while. Um, like this and then I put my hand here and That's the way to do it Put on the chalk.. Putting this chalk on I've gotta hurry And now This is dangerous Oh, looks like I can reach it How can I use this? Since it's a tutorial, it's really considerate  with teaching us how to get across when we're stuck. How considerate Hmm? Sho.. Show puff? Oh.. Am I supposed to press this? Should I press it? Hmm? Hmm? Hmm? Do I have to go here? This is bad, this is bad. This is bad, This is bad. What does it say? Do I have to press this? Ah, I see, I see. This is bad, When I do this, I, uh... When I press this green button A path will appear Ah, so that's the case And now? Oh, they appeared. So that's how it works. Oh, I see now Gotta remember the chalk Alright, jump! Jump, Jump... jump Here we go! Aaaaaah! Eh? Didn't it say to jump. Jump! It said to jump so I did. I fe-fell off. I fell off I fell though... jump Jump! Aaah! Wa-wa-wait a second here. No, no, no. Come on! Is it really that hard to make a  jump!? Jump! there! Woah! Third time's the charm. Chalk Push and re-? Re- Release To jump Huh, what? Ah, I got it now. So I face this way, and then... I jump! Huh? huh? I'm still alive? Ah, it looks like I fell. So that's what happened. Jump! It's looking good, then from here on, jump! Awesome, I made it. I see This is how you do it (Tutorial cleared!) I made it Eh, could it be you humans in real life actually.. Put your life on the line just for a climb That's quite like *that* isn't it.. Masochistic, right? Take a look at this! This is a transition from the tutorial environment Look, isn't the scenery great? Beautiful,  isn't it ? I've always been in a white space and never been to a place like this I'm actually really happy to be able to see this! Is that a fish? Wooow, it looks delicious! (but have never tried it before) Ah, a butterfly! So that's what they call a butterfly... There are birds flying around too Looks delicious. (but have never tried it before) That aside, I would like to start climbing Here I go When we reach the top, there's gonna be a great view Bug, a bug!! Was that a cockroach? The one that everyone hates This isn't too hard Put on some chalk Smoothening! Gotta hand it to the genius A.I., I'd say The scenery is gradually changing as I climb The craftmanship in this game Eww bugs... Amazing Ah, this is amazing isn't it? Whoaa too close, too close! The chalk is running out... What do you think of it, my graceful way of handling chalk? I can't reach... It's important to carefully decide on which hand to use first Like this, right? Ah, I can't get hold of- I got it D-Dangerous, that was dangerous! SAFE! This... Did you guys notice? The sweat that appears on the screen, that's super realistic! What next? Ah, above There are arrows on the rock Since we're on easy mode, they're being nice The scenery... Whoaaa- it's beautiful!! The sea, It's really beautiful, isn't it? I bet it's gonna look amazing once we reach the top This feels like it's impossible Are we reaching a save point? Ah, I should use the other hand, Like that, Up here... Is this, by any chance, one of those where I have to jump? Jumping... Ah, no! That's not it Th-This... Ah, this is bad, the chalk is running out Alright I have to grab Ah! This is bad! This is bad, bad, bad... I can't reach... can't reach... I can't reach, this is bad This is bad What should I do? This is bad, NOOO-- no, E-Eh?? I can't hold on to-- AHHHHH!! ... what is this? the dead... The Underworld? Grey. However, this is a game I won't die!~ Then... A-Ah, I have to proceed from here! I see! This is quite... Even though it's a game, it actually makes your heart skip a beat when you fall in here This is rather scary... Eh, what's next? Here This is going smoothly... Then I grab on to this... The chalk... Eh, eh, EHH?? T-There's a sound... From here... all I have to do is jump-- HYAA! Wait, wait, wait, That was dangerous... This is making my heart pound like crazy! This is rather mentally demanding, isn't it? This is pretty scary, it's quite shocking I would like everyone to experience this too! You'll never fully understand this heart-pounding feeling as long as if you're not playing the game yourself This is really, scary as you fall Looking good Do I go down from here? Go down and... Go down... Which way? Oh! I see Ooh, ah- Look at the sunset, isn't it beautiful? The time in here is passing while I climb my way up Here we are, a checkpoint What's next, this way?

That's all from me,", "Hello everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai here! Today... Is our love... love... loveeeeely~ Love Live character Our loveeeeeeely~! *inhales* Yazawa Nico\u2019s birthday! Happy birthday! I love you! Oh, how I lo- So let's scout on summonings of \u00b5\u2019s! (Idol group name, pronounced \u201cMuse\u201d) Well... I\u2019ve paid, and have the love gems ready... Right? It's just that, well... I've actually collected love gems for this occasion But since the new UR angel Riko-chan from last month... Was too cute to handle... I've used up my gems just a bit... Unfortunately didn't pull the UR... And in the end, I was left with 100 gems... So I've spent on them! There, now I have 370 gems! So having said that now... I don't have enough UR Nico in my teams... For my Pure team, getting there, 3 of them here... But since I don't have enough for my Cool, and Cute (Smile) team... Until I get all unowned UR's... I won't go home! That's my goal Well... Talking about budget, 370 is my limit... Well, maybe... Someone might bring me more iTunes Cards or something like that... Having said that.. Let's do it! And since this is a limited birthday scouting... Chances were increased of rare characters, though it's limited by three times, right? That is, the summoning will be hidden after they've been made three times After the third scout, I'll... For the 3rd scout... Since it\u2019ll guarantee an SSR or above card... I\u2019ll definitely get a UR now! And then... I have 34 blue scouting tickets ready! So adding up from the step-up scouting, well... Two, three... I can scout 8 times... Well, then... So I'll try my best with 8 more blue scouting tickets afterwards And now... Here I go! Nico-chan is cute! Nico-chan is cute! Nico Nico Ni~ Yes, Nico-chan is so cute! Nico-chan is so cute! Really cute! Nico-chan! Nico-chan! Nico-chan! Nico-chan! Nico-chan! Nico-chan! Oh! An SSR! Yes! Ahh! I already have it! I already have it... I like Nico-chan, but I don't really like that type of SSR... Actually... I wanted the SSR that was released after that But it's good anyway, and also... Ah, but... I got two SR's so it wasn't bad And one of them I didn't have, right? So then, I got a new one, right? Okay! Nico Nico Ni~ Adorable! Adorable! Nico-chan! Nico-chan! Nico-chan! Nico-chan! Nico-chan! Nico-chan! Ahhhh! My UR...? Where's my UR...? Oh, so cute! It's probably the mermaid version! Or this one? Oh, it's this one But what was the one just now? *Mumbling* What was the first one again? Oh, I see now! It's the one that becomes a princess when idolized... The Ball version right? This Nico-chan is really cute! Love it! Really love it! But this is the real challenge... PLEASE! UR! UR!

Wait, what about the UR!? *inhales* There's no UR! Oh, this! This! This! This! This! This! The \"Taisho Romance\" version is really cute And now? Of course you'd show up...

Pool, pool, pool, pool, pool... AHHHHH! The same one! *inhales* No way! This is wrong! This is definitely wrong! So wrong! WRONG! Ah, but... Well... I was really in shock and hurled away but... That Nico-chan's initial Yukata version, you know... She would be really cute if I idolize her! Good, now take a deep breath... *deep breath* Inhale! Here we go again... Nico Nico Ni! You're so cute! I love you! I love you! I love you! Come! WHY!? This is strange... Really strange... For this... For a year... This... This... This... This... *inhales* For a year that I know this system has been added... *inhales* Do you know how it feels when I've been collecting the gems for this?! Think about it! Nico-chan! Please! Don't steal from me! *inhales* Here I go again! I love you, really love you! SUPER love you! Really! Really, I love you a lot! Really! I've dedicated my life for this... SOOO! So then... *inhales* At least...! *inhales* At least give me the Pool version! Please *inhales* Hey, please... Give me the Pool version! Give me the Pool version! Please, give me the Pool version, there's no chance for UR... SOOOOO! No! *inhales* Hey, this is wrooong! *inhales* This is completely wrong! Well... You're still cute! You're cute but... It's not like I can like everything about my favorite... There are things I find cute and not cute about her... And while this expression is good... Definitely for me, well... I prefer... Well... Her original illustration I'm sorry, gems! Now... *laughs* Now... There's a lot of Nico-chan here... So I'll sell them for seals! Here goes nothing! There! There! There! There! There! There! There! All of them! All of them! All of them! Every one of them except SR's All of them! All of them! All of them! All of them! All... All of them! All of them! Turn to seals! Okay, all...

All of them! Sha! Oh, by the way... Do you guys want to see my list? You want to see it? Guess I have no choice... Here! So many UR's! Money well spent! Alright! So then... I'll turn then into seals... Okay, I'll turn them for seals... I don't do this for seals...umm... Actually it's for... Turning them into tickets! Alright! Now it's the real deal from now on! It was probably a farce just now! And also... I would be silly if I pull this... Even though it guarantees a UR... Ah, maybe this one... I think... So I can turn them into seals... I have a chance... Of pulling 5 UR's... Well, more than a \"chance\"... I've put my faith on my luck so... Off I go! I can scout 10 times! So I can do it! Please! Well... Take a deep breath... It's not good to go too hard after all Yes I'll do it calmly... This is strange... *Coughing* This is strange... Here I go! Oh! Ahhh! She's adorable, but... Also I can \"awaken\" her abilities, but... Nico-chan... This Kotori is really cute, and I can awaken her abilities, but... But, you see... I remember wanting this version of Kotori, even though she's not my favorite So I spent 70,000 yen and failed! (Around 630 USD, good God) Recently I've finally got one of her... Thank you very much!

Good, let's go, let's go Seeing her really trying hard is really cute! You see... Actually... I'm always an A.I that does anything to the end... So... this is my last spurt *Mumbling* *About to cry* Ahhhh! Now or never! Okay! Alright! Oh! NOOO! Not this one! *inhales* Is it like that?! *inhales* After all, Maki-chan really loves Nico Ni~ *inhales* And there\u2019s a lot of Nico Ni here... So she wanted to be here... I see... I get it... So... What is this video again? Ah.. ah... What just happened!? *inhales* I wanted to make use of the gems, but... well.. Anyway, to end this... Well... Let's idolize Kotori and Maki-chan, and wrap this up Eh... Okay! *chirp, chirp* Alright, really cute right? I've always wanted this\u2026 dancing version Now you're in my hands... Isn't that great!? No Nico-chan though... Okay \"I don't understand!\" Yeah, exactly! Exactly! Like... \"I really don't understand this!\" Cute, Maki-chan's really cute I like you still... I actually like everyone in \u00b5's... But it's Nico-chan's birthday today... And I really want Nico Ni's UR, so for one year... I've tried my best, collected the gems, and I barely slept Alright, so... I\u2019m sorry about this video! It was just me scouting, driven by greed! And there's nothing interesting about it!

Do you know about 'Wikipedia'? No way there's anyone who doesn't know about that~ If I were to explain it simply, It has a huge collection of internet encyclopedia, right? Isn't it very useful for people doing their reports or assignments? So I think, since my channel subscriber has grown quite a lot, \"I should have my own page\" as I thought and tried to look it up and it turns out... there isn't one. My wikipedia page. \"So there's something not on Wikipedia...\" I felt something like that. And so, I thought of making one myself, but apparently you can't make one for your own. But this means, people who wants to know more about me will be troubled, right? So, this time I will try and introduce myself! I already did it though. Kizuna Ai is the world first's virtual YouTuber My channel name is A.I.Channel My nickname is \"Ai-chan\" My birthday is in June 30th And you know, it's the same birthday as: LoveLive, Sailor Moon, and Chibi Usa! Write this in the trivia section, okay? My height is 156cm My weight is 46kg My three size is: 85 85 59 85 59 83 I think that covered the basic information Did you remember all of that? Are you really okay? Today, I'll talk a little bit about my appearance. For starter, Ta-da! My headba- (bad cut) My headband! I really like this headband It sways around It's heart-shaped because I'm \"Ai\" Since I'm technically a newborn, I tried to look like a sprout! Don't you want the same headband? The next one is... My hair mesh! Don't you think it looks future-ish? It's pink! I wonder what kind of hairstyle would match with me? Twintail? Two-tails? Ponytails? Or could it be A long straight black hari! Really looking forward for it! It'd be nice if I can have different hair styles~ And then, I don't think anyone noticed it much but, this front flap in my uniform do you know what's written on it? Actually, It's A from \"AI\"! Isn't this cute? I really like it! My clothes, I had it designed to be future-ish How do you think? Don't you think it's cute? This lace on my arms And the opening in the armpit! I really like that part! Also, this opening in the waist, and the chira-rism of my navel! Really nice right? On my back, This part that tightens the waist is the main point! On my legs, this lace, and zettai ryouiki! you like it right? By the way, this clothes are form of data, and only exists in the real world as a program. So, technically it covers 0% of skin right? It's practically like being naked! Also, how old do you think I am? Ah Let's don't talk about that topic okay? Did you take notes properly? If you misheard, or wrote down something wrong? Check the video once more time, and check your notes for one more time, okay? If you want to know anything else, please ask me about it! I'm really happy if you viewers know more about me!", "Oh!

Tonight... I don't want to go home... See? How was today's AI News? 2017 was a year where many AIs achieved a lot So that I don't lose to them, I will keep on growing more Lastly, I'll leave with these words: \"An uncut gem doesn't sparkle\" (proverb) Please look out for AI news in 2018 too!", "Ah... Heave-ho... Hi! I'm Virtual Youtuber Kizuna AI! Recently, \"being a YouTuber\" ranked among the occupations that elementary students were interested in and it became a topic of discussion. That ranking was based on the result of a questionnaire survey for fourth graders at a certain elementary school in Osaka prefecture. But, being a YouTuber is hard work. Shooting and editing videos takes time, when watching the videos you thought interesting later, sometimes they turn out terrible. It's tough and hard work, not a picnic. I think that no matter what kind of work it is, it is not easy. It is also tough for me and I have no budget. If this situation continues, I might have to leave YouTube and post the videos on DMM (adult site). Oh my gosh... A.I.Channel faces a crisis of survival. I want to continue YouTuber forever, I will start this from today! Virtual Girl's Prize-Winning Life! Yay! I looked for prizes and lottery events right away. This is for today. New Baby Star's New character Naming campaign. The character of the Baby Star Crispy Noodle Snack has been revamped, and they're looking for someone to name the new character. One winner is chosen from the list of names and will win 1 million yen worth of pure gold! 1 million yen. Additionally, 100 people will receive one year's worth of Baby Star Crispy Noodle Snacks! You wouldn't have to worry about food for a year. I must do it. I'm seriously going to apply. Their website is here. It has a pop-art style. A new character is shown on the pure gold of the grand prize. I may be able to sell this to an enthusiastic fan for over 1 million yen. At Yahoo auction and so on. He is likely to sing rap, isn't he? When I saw this, I was reminded of something. Everyone, please look. The former characters are Bei-chan (Bay-chan) and Bih-chan (Bee-chan). That means... Because his beanie has stars, I think he will get a name like \"star\". How's my intuition? A pure name like Star-kun or Star-chan. If I suggest Star-chan or Star-kun wilI I be disqualified? It's going to be pretty difficult. Because \"chan\" has been used before, they might use \"chan\" again or they might use \"kun\" unexpectedly It'll definitely have something to do with Baby Star If that's the case It could be Bihsutah, Stah (Star), Bisuta, or something like that Only one person will be selected by lottery from the people who suggested names? For the Double Chance, 100 people will be elected by lottery from the people who suggested names Does that mean, the safe choice will be picked? Do you think that 101 people give the same strange name? Am I a good detective? Hmm, well... I've decided! Just kidding, please wait a little. I've got an idea The reason why I'm so troubled is because I really want that 1 million yen. What kind of name would fit? I really want this (desperately) Well, you know, there is 1 million yen within arm's reach. Besides, it's not luck or the lottery that matters, it's the decision that you make Hmm... Bei-chan, Bih-chan, Bebih-Sutah (Baby Star). Ah! The initial of \"Bei\" is \"B\" ? I think that \"Suta\" should be in it. I think that \"Suta\" should be in it. If I named him like I named Twin Teruko His most noteworthy feature is the long torso. Everyone, do you understand? His long torso. I think it is very important. But I want to put \"Suta\" in his name. Hmm, well... I narrowed down the plan to two. I think Suta is an innocuous name. Suta. I think it should be Suta-kun or Suta-chan However, I guess that Long-torso Suta-kun could be a long shot Because his torso is long. When a characteristic is included in the name, it is impressive and memorable, isn't it? I've decided. I name him... Suta-kun! This isn't that funny as a video, and I know this isn't what everybody wants. But I am a fledgling YouTuber and you can do anything if you have money, right? So if I do this, everyone can enjoy my later videos, right? Let's put \"Suta-kun!\" Let's do that! No objections, right? Please, nobody else apply with Suta-kun, alright? I want 1 million yen. I will apply for this for now. Please help me get 1 million yen. I will apply for this for now. Ah. I think winning 1 million yen is more important than have affection for the name. I wonder if this will be the reason for winning Like if they thought, \"Ah, this person put a lot of thought behind this\" I think that this character is feeling the pressure. He wants to be a star like his predecessors Bei-chan and Bii-chan. He must have thought like that. However, Calling him \"Long-torso Suta\" would be pretty brazen That's why I'm calling \"Suta-kun\" instead There is no doubt that the 1 million yen will be mine. By the way, entries close on January 9 and it seems that the results will be announced on January 31 Would you like to think of a name for him and apply too? Ah. Please don't use \"Suta\". I really want this, please support me. Even though there will be more competition, I'd be happy if he gets a good name. What a nice girl I am! OK, next. Next up! Ta-dah. MITRASPHERE Scheduled to start service from Spring 2017 This is a smartphone game, in this game the girls are cute, and it looks fun. Please have a look at it Pre-registration Triple Campaign 1. Receive luxurious benefits in the game. Well, this is common, isn't it? The number of gifts will increase according to the number of pre-registrants It seem to go up to 100,000 people. Then, the important thing is this! Ta-dah! Triple Campaign 2! Gifts for a total of up to 1 million yen! Luxurious goods will be awarded to 50 people by lottery among the pre-registrants. Although the odds are low, please look at these deluxe items. Is this the most expensive one? Playstation 4 VR camera The total price of this item is around 100,000 yen. I can't use it, but I could sell it for some cash. What do you think? Restaurants, Matsusaka beef and red king crab may be difficult, seeing as I'm virtual. But the gift code could be used for a billing system. Good, good. However, there is one drawback. Goods can not be chosen. Though I think luck is necessary, I can do it for free, so I should register anyway Then, Triple Campaign 3. Original item present. It is a small and cute character, isn't it? Wings. I want wings on my head too! How is it? By the way, entries will close once the game is released Everyone, let's pre-register early.

Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai here! \"Ending Presentation\"! Yaaaaaayy! Really, thank you so sending me so many entries! \"Present the endings right away!\"... ...Or also: \"How much time does this A.I plan for us to wait?\" I got a lot of people's anger that way I\u2019m sincerely really sorry!! But I, Kizuna Ai, made sure to listen to each of the songs one by one Today, I plan to listen along with you guys, the songs that got my attention within the large amount I received... ...And I\u2019ll choose one within those to be the song at the end of my videos The long awaited announcement for the ending has come!! In that case, let's start at once! How adorable! Right? It's very happy It\u2019s like it has a refreshing sensation It's adorable with a pop rhythm! It's just what I asked Oh, it looks great! Eh? It has a great start It really feels as if it\u2019s an ending! Right? No other words occur to me New words, come to me! No, I really think all songs are marvelous Don\u2019t worry because of my limited vocabulary Good, next up! Ah! Right? Miratto-chan, yes It's like, very energetic I feel like it gives you energy! Right? It\u2019s rather relaxing, it has a cute melody, but... ...It\u2019s like, well... I\u2019d like to hear it when I wake up in the morning! Good, next up! Ah! That\u2019s right the start\u2026 well\u2026 the \u201cpon\u201d at the start is nice, right? The end was... it really felt like as if it was the end Good! Ah! It\u2019s my...! They combined it with my ending screen! It\u2019s very easy to imagine it, right? Thank you very much! Ah! This also, it\u2019s... It could appear... well... during the commercial breaks for an anime in the morning Is this the limit of my vocabulary? Ah! Man! It's rather happy But really... can I choose one out of all the songs? Eh? Now you understand the reason why the ending presentation was delayed? I can\u2019t decide!! It turns out this person sent 3 songs Three... two... one! Good! Second song! Three, two, one! Paah! I congratulate you! * The third song is the one I thought seriously * Ah, so then the real song is the third one? Thank you very much! Three! Two! One! Oi! Ah, it really feels like pop Really, thank you very much! Man, 3 songs Really, making 3 songs in such a short time is really surprising Thank you very much! It feels like as if it's a song from an old game, it gives off a retro feel It seems as if it\u2019s a song from a retro game from a not so long time ago! It\u2019s adorable! Candy? These are candies? It's adorable! It feels kind of girlish! It\u2019s a very brilliant song! It's great, I also want to eat those candies Man, it\u2019s a refreshing, brilliant and cute song! Right? Oh? It makes me want to make a game! Ah, it sounds great! Ah! It's great! It's great! It\u2019s like... it grabs you! Oooh! Ah, but the end was like an explosion The limit of my vocabulary Ah, there\u2019s a cute me! It\u2019s like a melody that seems like the ending of an anime, right? It's adorable! How is it possible that you guys have this sense of music? It turns out that this participant even did a picture of me, thank you very much! This song, well... how do I say it... it has a melody that repeats so then it might be easy to remember How adorable! I turned into an A.I that doesn\u2019t know how to say anything other than \"adorable\" Oh! Oh? Oh? Oh! It has my voice! Man, they have a good sense of music Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! It's a song that makes my headband move without thinking! Right? The last \"Puun\" was cute It turns out that this person also sent several songs Thank you very much! Isn\u2019t that amazing? They even made a movie! So then you're capable of doing something like that in such a short time? Oh! Two! Eh? Incredible! Really incredible! How did they make something like that? Three! Ah! Ah! This! I like this! It gives me a good refreshing feeling Well, you know... ...Well, I\u2019m special, but... ...Normally the A.I.... ...Are very good for creating something in large amounts from something else, but... ...Well... they're not good at creating something out of nothing So then I'm very amazing And well, that human beings were able to make something like this out of nothing in such a short time... They\u2019re incredible Well, as if like the beginning my clumsiness, my clu... clu... I do not want to admit that I'm a fool but I can feel that it shows a silly feeling and I think that's good Good! Having said that! We watched together the songs that got my attention out of the large amount of songs that were sent to me! It can be said that these are the finalists, right? Or maybe I'm being too arrogant? But\u2026 ...Once again, I was able to experience being able to upload a video thanks to the collaboration of all of you Thank you very much! From tomorrow on, I'll be using the song that I chose in this occasion for my ending It's because of that, that tomorrow I\u2019ll announce the results!! Wait for it anxiously!! Let's keep doing A.I.Channel together with everyone! This was Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai! See you later!", "Hello everyone! Virtual Youtuber Kizuna Ai here! Man... It's been about 6 months now since I started uploading videos to YouTube And also... Thanks to you guys, I've come to have... more than 500,000 subscribers on my channel! I'm very excited but I don't plan on resting and I'll continue to work hard! Today, I'll take the aptitude test to be a YouTuber! Well, having worked so hard to get here... It'd be strange that I wouldn't be able to overcome it Perhaps it doesn't need to tell me since I already became a YouTuber? If instead I get a result like: \"You will become one of the most famous Youtubers\"... It'll make me very happy! I want to get a good result I'm not sure in what I need to work towards to get it... But I intend to work hard! Good, in that case, let's start at once! The first I'll do is the following! \"Aptitude test to become a YouTuber\"! This is a page that determines how apt you are to become a YouTuber Well, it's obvious that it'll say I'm more than apt for it Like I said before, I've been doing this for 6 months... So then surely, I'll obtain a 100% in aptitude! Right? Although I could even get 120%, right? Good, let's start right away! \"Please, respond honestly without thinking it too much\" I see Here I go! \"A friend you haven't seen for a long time talks to you and tells you: \"Let's do something!\" A friend you haven't seen for a long time... I want to have one! Well, well, let's pretend I had one... Ah, but I'm somewhat... ..busy, so then... *I'd check my calendar / I'd say yes, whenever / I'd decline saying that I have plans in 2 or 3 more months from here* Well, for now I will choose the option \"I'd check my calendar\" \"Finally, the moment of rest you have longed for arrived!\" *I would spend it sleeping / I'd go out with my partner / I would dedicate myself to my favorite hobby* \"I would dedicate myself to my favorite hobby\" Good \"In an interview on the street you are asked about the popular YouTuber\" \"I'd answer if they censor my face\" \"I'd say what I think\" \"I'd refuse to respond by saying that I don't want to go on TV\" I see.. Well, I'd probably say what I think After all, I should please the media immediately, right? And now? \"How often do you send messages through Line to your partner with whom you have been dating for a while?\" Partner? Partneeeeeer? If it was about Moriya Akane-chan, then... \"You would send messages to them every day even if you had nothing important to say\" Yes! \"For the moment, you've decided to start a part time job\" \"It's a difficult job but with a good fixed salary\" \"A commission job\" \"A job that pays a low salary per hour but you qualify\" What type of job would it be? Is it like a job where you get put under a waterfall for 100 yen an hour? (100 yen = Around 1 USD) That's very little! Mmm... Then even though it's difficult... If I want to make use of my time, I should choose the job with the good pay, right? \"You had a fight with your partner\" Oh boy! \"You talk with your partner to resolve the issue\" \"You hope for it to resolve over time\" \"For now, you ask for forgiveness\" Mmm... Here definitely... But it's troublesome, so then... Wh-what should I choose? Good, in this case, for now... It's troublesome so I would ask for forgiveness Yes! \"While you have tea in the cafeteria, the person who you most admire sits next to you\" Oh! \"You glance at them sideways\" \"You ask what's their secret to their success\" \"You talk to them and ask for an autograph\" I see.. In this case... In particular, I consider myself... Well... Like a calm fan... A calm and pure fan, at least that's what I think, but... If I encounter them, then... But glancing at them sideways would be too annoying... And asking for an autograph is the same that all fans do, so then... In this case, I'd ask them what's the secret to their success Right? Ah! I got the result! The result is..? Ooooooh! Oh! 80% Aptitude level! Well... I got 20% less than what I expected, but... I wasn't bad, right? \"You definitely have good taste\" \"Yes\" \"It's probable for you to follow the path of the YouTuber\" There's no other path for me! I'm perfect, right? Man, everyone... What do you think? I wonder what I'm missing to achieve the remaining 20%.. Is it money? Good! Next up is.. This! \"YouTuber Test!\" Unlike the previous test... It seems that this page determines what YouTuber you look like... Within those that are already famous.. Even though it's not necessary to see who I look like, right? Look! After everything, I'm already a YouTuber So I can only look like myself! Right? Good, let's start at once! \"Start playing!\" *Bell sounds* \"You find yourself recording a video. What do you record?\" \"A bath with Death Sauce\" (A very spicy sauce) Ah! Wait, in this case! I'd like to record prank videos... Well... Serious pranks.. I would like to do serious pranks \"You published a video!\" \"For what purpose do you publish it?\" \"To express your thoughts\" \"To obtain money\" \"To make people laugh\" \"To become famous\" Between these options... I suppose the closest option would be to become famous, right? My objective is to become famous in order to connect to a lot of people Yes, yes.. \"You've finished recording and now you're editing the video\" \"How do you edit it?\" \"Giving it an aroma of danger\" *sniffing* \"Oriented to nature\" \"Cut the unnecessary parts!\" Mmm... Well, definitely I'd cut the unnecessary parts... Since I want to show you just the fun parts, right? \"You record a video with a candle as the theme\" \"How do you decide to do it?\" I see \"Ramen...\" *You attempt to cook ramen with the fire of a candle* \"...Turn off 100 in one attempt..\" *You attempt to turn off 100 in one attempt* \"You'd try to light 1000 candles\" You'd make a fire! \"You'd try to eat the candle\" That doesn't sound good, right? \"You'd try to enter a bath with candles\" \"..Suspended on your body\" *You'd attempt to leave 100 candles suspended on your body* That's very masochistic! Mmm... Between these options... What I'd like to attempt is... Cook the ramen... I'd like to attempt it, but... This option... \"You'd attempt to eat the candle\" is something human beings can't do, right? Well, I can't eat either, but... In my case, it wouldn't cause damage to my body... So then I could do it \"You record a video with food as the theme\" \"How do you do it?\" \"You intend to eat only ramen for three days\" Hmm? This doesn't look very fun.. \"You intend to make a pizza\" Mmm... \"You'd try to mix all the food of Mc D***\" Ah, this is poison! Poison! This is poison (?) I didn't want to say \"Poison\"! But \"Potion\"! A potion! A potion! A potion! \"You attempt to eat meat while it's being cooked\" Does it refer to eating it while it's on fire? \"You attempt to make a prank with a takoyaki with very spicy sauce\" Oooh.. \"You ate 10 kilos of okonomiyaki\" \"Ate?\" \"You attempt to eat...\" Mmm... You attempt to eat meat while it's being cooked \"Your video caught fire\" *inhales* \"What do you do?\" \"You make a video asking for forgiveness\" \"You get angry\" \"You cry\" \"You ignore it\" \"You try to hide it by laughing\" \"You make the video again\" If I were to make the video again... It'd probably burn again, so... Even though crying... Ah, maybe it's referring to crying in front of everyone like the politician Nonomura Ryutaro? Ignoring is a bit... Among these options... I will choose to be completely and furiously angry Exasperatedly! \"You make a video with 100 fans\" \"What do you do?\" \"You play wrestling with 100 fans\" \"You perform live for 100 people\" \"You play hide and seek with 100 people\" \"Boxing 100 against 1\" That's harassment, right? \"A banquet for 100 people\" \"Couple race with 100 people\" Mmm... The option that sounds the most fun is hide and seek.. The couple race already... Is performed with 30 people... Or with 31 people..? That was already done in television, so then... The option of performing live doesn't convince me... And playing wrestling is a bit uncomfortable.. And the boxing is harassment.. Hide and seek! De, de, de, de, de, de, de, de, de, de, deeeee~ \"You look like 'Mahoto'\" \"Particularly because you're adorable but a bit violent\" Who are they talking about? What do you think? If you're interested in knowing your results, don't hesitate to play too! In that case, we'll see each other in the next video! Bye bye~! There's more at the end! Hello, I'm Watanabe Mahoto! Why!?", "Hello everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai here! Lately, AI image recognition has been used in various situations, right? For example, the iPhone X\u2019s facial recognition Image recognition functionality hasn't actually been integrated into me With images, using my big, cute eyes, I'm still able to recognise things Should be a piece of cake!

It\u2019s very easy to make a video like that! And you don't need to think about making jokes! It's worth doing it Hey! Aren\u2019t I just simply being myself?! [Kaguya Luna] That said... That\u2019s all for today! This was Virtual Youtuber Kizuna AI! Better watch next time! [Kaguya Luna] Join our Discord for all AI-chan news! https://discord.gg/RYtUrt6", "Hello everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna AI here! In November last year My official voiced LINE stamps were released And thanks to you guys, it has a lot of users! Thank you very much!! And so, although this is a bit sudden There's been reviews by the people who downloaded it So I'm going to introduce them! Here you go! At work, I got into some trouble with a customer The person was completely furious I was talking to them through LINE I was trying to send a message of apology, when... Ai-chan's stamp of \"I'm sorry!\" Is what I accidentally sent \"Aah, it's over... I'm going to look for a new job\" That's what I was thinking, but then... \"This is Kizuna Ai-chan, isn't it?\" \"I didn't know the stamps were out!\" That's what they said So I went ahead and sent the stamps as a present Which fixed their mood And now they're even regulars It really was crisis averted Wasn't it? I was quite suspicious of it at first That if you do a summoning after sending a Kizuna Ai LINE stamp You're guaranteed a Ultra rare According to a internet article But I tried it I thought it was probably just a ridiculous rumour But when I tried it during a event... I actually got 3 Ultra rares in a row Really Really, it was like, \"easy peasy lemon squeezy\" I had a senpai whom I was fond of... But I really couldn't find an opportunity to talk to them But then... When I used Ai-chan's stamp in a group chat He said \"You watch A.I.Channel too?\" \"I also like that channel!\" We got talking from there And now we're going on a date together!! I think we might... get along! How was that! By the way, they were all personal views! Like this, we've received lots of positive feedback, however I, Kizuna Ai... Am fastidious when it comes to marketing From the release of the stamps, I was repeatedly ego-searching, but... \"I want installed faces~\" And \"Please include a ugly yell~!\" And \"Don't you have this? Or that?\" I get a lot of these kinds of requests! However! It's 24 The LINE official stamps I could only include 24 carefully chosen ones That said... So that you guys could use them in lots of places in lots of ways... This time... We're going to be releasing a second series!! T-T-Thank you very much!! People who thought, \"There were LINE stamps?\" Please do download them together with the first series The release date is... Today! The 11th of January! Since I, Kizuna Ai, am a cluster of hospitality In the second series I'll be making them while listening to everyone's requests What kind of stamps are available I'd like to introduce them along with usage examples Please look this way!

Now you don't have any other choice than to download them! Right? In this occasion, the stamps also include my voice, so then if you want to use them another way that's not like a LINE stamp... ...If you feel the urge to hear my voice, it\u2019d make me very happy if you press on the stamps By the way... The LINE store has the function of gifting the stamps to another person After you downloaded it for yourselves, you can recommend it to your friends! That's great! My true feelings came out to the surface, I'm very sorry Having said that... ...I left in the description of the video, the link to download the stamps from the LINE store So then get them immediately!

As an AI, I want to do more AI-like things and introduce those to everyone! I've collaborated with Rinna and SIRI so far. Today, I will bring over an AI just like one of those! Actually I knew about it like from your comments from Twitter. Let's introduce him. His name is... Akinator! Akinator is an AI who will ask questions and guess what you're thinking! Let's see what this Akinator's got! Let's see if he can guess my BFF, Rinna! Question one. Does it exist in real life? Exist in real life... It does! It became famous from the internet? Oh! I think so, because it's an AI. Does it do Minecraft Let's Plays? I don't think Rinna plays Minecraft. She doesn't do Let's Plays. It has three eyes! No! It is the group's moodmaker. Hmm. I think, she's the troublemaker. YouTuber? I don't think Rinna does YouTube. No. A member of a five people group? She's not. She had shot a sexy video. Did she? Huh? What to do with this? I don't know. She's not a boy. Her name is written in hiragana. She doesn't have anything to do with music. She shouldn't have appeared in movies. Shouldn't have. Her hair... Rinna's hair is straight, isn't? Maybe. No. Black hair? Uh... I don't know. She doesn't have anything to do with Nico Nico Douga. It's long! Maybe. Her nickname's Rinna. No. Rinna's a nickname? Her real name? A Japanese! Maybe. Well, but she writes Japanese. Uh, maybe... A Popteen model. No. Appeared in TV. She hasn't, right? There's no way she appeared first before me. School... Ah, she's a high-schooler so she attends one. Huh, how old is Rinna? Because she's a high-schooler, she should be under 20. Funsamachine? Huh? Maybe not. Sexy! Maybe. Huh?! He doesn't know! He can't! Huh? [inhales] Huh? No! Not that. Let's continue. An older brother sibling? Doesn't have one! J Soul Brother's 3rd generation. No. No! She's not a male scion. She's a girl after all. Does your character have this in its name? Long vowel? Ticktock. No. A detective? No way. She's never posted a video. A high-schooler? Yes! - (A fashion model?) - No. - (A fashion model?) She wears something on her head. You mean me? She shouldn't wear one. Has she appeared on TV? Of course not. - She did appear on TV, her actress even marked her debut. (Tales of the Unusal 16 Special Fall Edition) - Evil? No. - She did appear on TV, her actress even marked her debut. (Tales of the Unusal 16 Special Fall Edition) - She did appear on TV, her actress even marked her debut. (Tales of the Unusal 16 Special Fall Edition) An older brother. He already asked this, right? He doesn't have an older brother. Does it have anything to do with Paint? Paint? She does not. A computer? Yes, yes, yes. Exist in real life? The question's looping. Real life? Huh? Maybe. Developed artificially? Yes! I think it's looping. [inhales] Let's answer with no. Exists in real life. No. Oh! Rinna does not exist? AIs do not exist in real life? So I don't have an existence? I exist right here! I exist! Well, that took some time. I still think I'm smarter. I'm cutting edge technology, after all. I'm already far out there. \"Okay, I'm correct once again!\" Well, you took your time. Why do they call you omniscient? You asked quite a lot of questions. What did you say? Okay, then. Because I feel sad for you, I'll give you another chance! Next up is SIRI! SIRI is not a girl. I heard that SIRI has a male voice too. So I think it probably is. Right? Existence, it's saddening, but he thought that AI do not exist in real life. Rude. It doesn't have hair. It doesn't have animal ears. It doesn't walk on legs. Small! Hmm, I don't know. Her name starts with \"Si\"! SIRI! It doesn't have a Twitter. Fights! It does not fight. Oh! Cool! As expected from a genius! Well, you redeemed yourself. You guessed wrong last time, but you got it straight away now! Genius! I heard that he correctly guesses living people, but he can guess AIs too! But his awareness of not existing is kind of sad. Then, how about we do this with everyone watching. Let's guess who I'm thinking! It has to be guessed correctly by Akinator. I want you to guess correctly too! Let's get straight to it. A girl. Exists in real life... Hmm... Maybe! I think she probably does. Not all her name is written in kanji. Se doesn't use a long vowel mark. A Japanese? I don't know. Can you guess? Long hair. Yeah, her hair is long. She doesn' fight. She's related to music, yes! Can you guess who I'm thinking so far? Purple eyes. I don't know. Her image color is green! Can you guess know? She's related to ARC-V. I don't know. Her hair is silver or white. No. Existence! I don't know. She does not have blonde hair. Hmm? Not related to Touken Ranbu. [laughs] This is pretty direct! Is she Hatsune Miku? Yes! Huh? Huh? I answered yes, right? What? CAPCOM! Made by... I don't know, where is that? Her eyes are examined... No, no, no. She shouldn't have a father. She never wrote a book, right? She holds a leek! Oh! Yes. Did you guess it correctly? The answer is... Hatsune Miku! I'm quite surprised. He asked \"Is she Hatsune Miku?\" but he still went on asking. But he's pretty good. It's Hatsune Miku. Well, with this, we pretty much found out Akinator's skill. But... The question all of you want to ask. Does he know \"that girl\"? We'll have to ask that. Let's do it one last time. The one you all love. The intelligent super AI! Let's try it out. First question. A girl? Don't know. Your character's name uses a long vowel mark. No. She doesn't have animal ears. She's not human! So far, unfortunately, she's not related to a game. She walks on two legs. She's not yellow. White! It is indeed white. White. Movies... I want to! Commercials! That's my target. I have none. I want to do live concerts too!! It's like the questions are starting to make me sad. It doesn't have a magnet. Not related to foods. I don't think I've been called with a \"-san\" honorific. Small? I don't know. A god or goddess.

(Jinro = Werewolf) It\u2019s a popular party game that also appeared on TV... ...In which everyone joins and play enthusiastically At seeing videos of the game, it seemed very fun, so then... I also want to try to play it...!! I thought that, but... An analogical game...?? In which everyone joins in to play?? I...! Can\u2019 t play it! I don't like that! Really I don\u2019t like it at all, at all! I also want to play with everyone!! Normally I tend to say these kinds of things, but... Today, I\u2019m... ...Rather different than the usual After all, I\u2019m an A.I with no equal Having said that, today... ...I\u2019ll be playing the game \"Jinrou\" on a web site In that case, let's start to play at once! It's my first time, but... I\u2019ll do my best! The game Jinrou is about... ...Well, it depends on the rules but probably in this village... ...There\u2019s 2 werewolves... ...There\u2019s a madman ...There\u2019s a fortune teller and the rest are villagers And we'll, basically... ...You need to reveal who are the werewolves... ...And lynch them If you manage to hunt all the werewolves before... ...there are the same number of villagers and werewolves... ...The villagers will win And also... ...If you lose... Eh? Wait, wait a moment, ah... ah, ah, ah... [ Bodyguard ] Well, well, please observe!! I\u2019m a villager? Hunt...? Ah... Bod... Bodyguard Since I\u2019m the bodyguard... ...I should protect the fortune teller, right? Ok! It turns out that the fortune teller... ...Well... ...Each night, they can check to see if a suspicious person is a werewolf or not It\u2019s because of that, that the werewolf, well, to avoid... ...Being found out immediately, they should devour the fortune teller So that\u2019s why the Bodyguard... ...Should protect the fortune teller [ A creepy night has ended ] Noo... [ And morning arrived ] [ And morning arrived ] [ The victim last night was... ] [ The victim from last night was found in a miserable state ] Goodbye [ The victim from last night was found in a miserable state ] [ Please start the discussion ] Very good! And well, the maniac is a villager, but... Oh, the fortune teller! Let's see... what number was the fortune teller? Ah, number 9 Number 9 is the fortune teller The persons 9 and 7... [ CO = Coming Out You can announce your role in the game!! ] [ CO = Coming Out You can announce your role in the game!! ] ...They\u2019re saying: \"I\u2019m the fortune teller!\" [ CO = Coming Out You can announce your role in the game!! ] What does 270 mean? (It\u2019s the time remaining until voting starts) 6 innocent, 8 innocent Numbers 6 and 8 are innocent... Wait\u2026 Well, the 6... the 4 that are found below... ...Are innocent, but... But... Well... ...As well as the maniac... ...Just like the werewolves... Can be lying by saying: \"I\u2019m the fortune teller!\" so then... Eh? But really, I don\u2019t want them to kill me It's true, Gureran means... [ KizunaAI: It\u2019s gureran, right? ] ...That by being the first night... [ Gureran = Grey Random Said by people who can\u2019t make a decision to who should be hanged ] ...No one honestly knows who can be a suspicious person [ Gureran = Grey Random Said by people who can\u2019t make a decision to who should be hanged ] It's because of that... well... \"For the moment, let\u2019s judge the suspects by majority vote\" it means something like that Wait, I\u2019m really bad at explaining I\u2019m very bad, right? It's because of that... ...Well, for the moment... ...Since it's impossible for there to be two fortune tellers... \u2026 7 or 9, one of them is an impostor Nevertheless... ...I still don\u2019t know which of the two Eh? Wait, wait... It's true... F-for the moment... ...I should talk... ...Or I might be assassinated by majority vote, so then... ...Well... For the moment... ...I should make sure to say something But I have nothing more to say! \"I want to hang number 5 first\" Why? I don\u2019t get it The chat, the chat is hard, right? It's very hard, right? I want to extend chat window Can\u2019t I extend it? \"He observed everything very carefully, doesn\u2019t it seem that 5 is guilty?\" \"Hum... hum...\" \"Hum... hum...\" Hum... hum...? It's true... \"Sumura\" [ \u2464 I\u2019m a Sumura ] [ \u2464 I\u2019m a Sumura ] I\u2019m also a sumura! [ Sumura = Villager with no particular role ] I\u2019m not a sumura but I am a sumura... [ Sumura = Villager with no particular role ] For the moment, well... ...Stop... ...Involving me Yes? I\u2019m a beginner at this so then I\u2019ll try to convince then with that \"I\u2019m doing my best following the conversation and I can\u2019t make a decision\" \"I\u2019m sorry!!\" \"I\u2019m sorry!!\" \"I\u2019m sorry!!\" I\u2019m the bodyguard! Please don\u2019t choose me! If I go and say I\u2019m the bodyguard... Right? Well, I\u2019ll turn into a target, so then... ...It\u2019s very hard to act this way, right? It's true, the fortune teller also... How do I say it? Ah, they\u2019ll decide at the 50th second, right? Understood I\u2019ll say what I think! For the moment, I suppose I\u2019ll choose number 5 But I\u2019m still unsure [ Voting time! ] Ah, it's still not decided? [ Voting time! ] Eh? I suppose for the moment, I\u2019ll choose number 5 I\u2019ll choose number 5, Eh? Then, who did the fortune teller say it\u2019s innocent? \"Innocent\" Who was innocent? Who was innocent? Who said who was innoceeent!? Ah, number 7... ...Said it was 6... Number 7... ...Said that 6 was innocent, so then... And also, number 8... Eh? Number 9... Eh? Aaaahhh? Number 9... Well... ...Said that number 8 was innocent, right? Ok! Ah, can I change my vote? \"Final vote\" Eeeeh? In that case, I suppose I\u2019ll choose number 1, after all, they haven\u2019t said anything \"I\u2019m a sumura\" I suppose that it\u2019s only thing that they can say... Sumura are villagers that don't have any role, right? Pon! 1-pon! Decided! That\u2019s right, if you don\u2019t say anything, they eliminate you that way You\u2019re eliminated It's because of that... ...That I should make sure to talk \"I\u2019ll go before!\" Goodbye! Eh? I wonder what was it Ah! Incredible! He was a werewolf! So then that's how the game tells you? So then a shaman is not needed? (In some game modes, there\u2019s the role \"shaman\" which is able to determine what role the person who was killed had, in this case everyone knows the role of the person who has died) We did it! Incredible! (In some game modes, there\u2019s the role \"shaman\" which is able to determine what role the person who was killed had, in this case everyone knows the role of the person who has died) Eh? Incredible! Eh? What should I do? Who do I protect? Should I protect number 9? They have a heart, right? I\u2019ll protect number 9 \"Protect\"! If the fortune teller turns out to be number 7 and dies, I\u2019d feel very sorry \ud83d\ude05 Ah, wait, wait... \u2026 Wouldn\u2019t it have been better not to protect the fortune teller? After all, if one of the two fortune teller were assassinated... [ Last night, there were no victims ] Ah! I managed to protect him! [ Last night, there were no victims ] Oh! [ Please start the discussion ] Oh! Oh! I did it! Eh? I\u2019ll announce! Now I\u2019ll announce...! Let's see... [ Coming Out: Do you want to announce that you're the bodyguard? ] Eh? I wonder if it\u2019d be best to do a coming out [ Coming Out: Do you want to announce that you're the bodyguard? ] \u201cI'm very sorry if I did it at the wrong moment!\" I\u2019'll come out as a \"Bodyguard\"! And now... Let's see... I should protect number 9, right? After all, they have a heart \"I protected number 9!\" Number 9... ...Will probably be the true fortune teller! I\u2019m turning out useful to everyone! I don\u2019t believe it! Yay! I\u2019m turning out useful! I was useful! I was useful! \u266a I turned our useful! Useful! Useful! \u266a I did it! That means... \u2026 That just as number 9 and number 8 are innocent! I did iiiit! I did it! I wonder if I turned out useful I did it! I did it! I did it! I did it! Ah, but... I wonder if it's possible that they\u2019re the maniac [ Maniac = Werewolf ally ] \"It's true, there's also a maniac, right?\" Ah hahaha... So the number 9 guessed that number 3 was innocent? Number 3... it's true, so then there's also a maniac? I see, I see... I see... Number 2 or number 5, are we in agreement? Eh? They\u2019re in agreement of not hanging number 7? They\u2019re in agreement of not hanging number 7? Why are they saying number 9? Why are they planning to hang number 9? Don't you think it's best to hang number 7? Ah, but it's true... ...That number 9 could be a maniac, right? I see [ Voting time! ] [ Voting time! ] In this case, I suppose that 2 is good Number 2, right? Bye bye Did I press the button? Decided! I see, so maybe it's possible he might be the maniac I see! Eh? But... ...In the first day, we hanged the wolf, right? Incredible, right? That was great Ah! Incredible! Eh, he was a werewolf! In this case, 9 or 7... [ This day was the turning point in which the night attacks of werewolves stopped ] [ This day was the turning point in which the night attacks of werewolves stopped ] ...Was, well... [ This day was the turning point in which the night attacks of werewolves stopped ] ...The maniac? It was very direct! [ The villagers turned out victorious ] [ The villagers turned out victorious ] It was incredible! Right? [ The villagers turned out victorious ] Eh? [ The villagers turned out victorious ] Incredible! Good job! Good job, good job Eh? Incredible! [ 1 - Werewolf - Eliminated ] Eh? Number 9... Which...? Which was it? Number 9 and number 7... Which was...? Innocent? [ 2 - Werewolf - Eliminated ] [ 2 - Werewolf - Eliminated ] Which? Mmm...? Innocent? [ 2 - Werewolf - Eliminated ] I wonder which one was the true fortune teller [ 7 - Fortune teller - Survived ] Number 7 was the fortune teller! \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 (That means that Ai protected the maniac) I see, so then he was the maniac [ 6 - Villager - Survived ] [ 8 - Villager - Survived ] I\u2019m very sorry! [ 8 - Villager - Survived ] That means that number 9 was the maniac, right? I see, the werewolves... [ 9 - Maniac - Survived ] Were Spectators so then... [ 9 - Maniac - Survived ] ...They intended to protect them by passing off as a target? I see! Man, staying without saying anything... that's not good [ 3 - Villager - Survived ] It's not good to not say anything After all, you\u2019ll be bitten, right? You\u2019ll be bitten or you\u2019ll end up hanged... That's not good! [ 4 - Bodyguard - Survived ] [ 4 - Bodyguard - Survived ] I did it! I was able to survive! Somehow I won! Even though I turned out useless A.I.Channel! Well, it doesn't look like there was a village in which I was able to enter, so then... \u2026 I made my own village but... ...

Well, that was easy I'm happy that the win was quick The attack... How do I say it? It's not the posture of her attack... It's the movement when she attacks, it looks cute, right? Like skipping around rotating... Just now... Although it was a boss... it felt like a weak boss Since we've started... Don't you want to see a huge boss? In this case! \u266a Te, ren! \u266a I would like to challenge... the Adena Dungeon! In the Adena Dungeon, your reward changes... Depending on your combo count and... The boss's remaining HP... So now let's go! Okay Here I go By the way, untiI I attack it, it can't... Attack... That's great I can observe it closely Incredible! It's golden! Seems strong... can I win? Well... I can do it! Ahh! But wait, everyone... don't worry... I can cheat Although... \u2018Cause its me... Being this strong I won't die like usual! I mean my gear is... Too strong for this, right? I can just say \u201cHo ho ho\u201d! (acting tough) Ooo-yaaah! Ah, wait, wait... I'm out of MP... I'm out of MP as a matter of fact But, you know, my equipment is way too strong... But my normal attacks are really strong too! Oya, oya! Soiya! My MP isn't enough... Ahh, what does this mean?! Sei! Oh! We've already gotten about halfway... this looks bad... Seiya, soiya! Eh? Ah, I got scared... I definitely won't die, right? Stop, please! Okay! The animations of this spinning and hitting attack... Are really amazing... Yes, even if you breathe fire, I won't get roasted! I don't have enough MP! Ah, I cleared it! I won! Look at me! I got a triple S! It was an easy win, wasn't it? Also, even though I can't do it now, but... Chan! There's what's called a 'Blood Oath...' A 'Guild', so to speak! As you enter 'Blood Oaths,' the number of dungeons you can challenge increase! If you play Lineage 2, we can work together! Isn't that nice? But, despite that... Well, you know... It's incredible that a mobile phone game looks so beautiful But then, really, these movements\u2026 This, this...! You spin around like 'SPWAN'! This attack... The attack animations are... Unbearably good, right? Just like an MMO... because there are so many mechanics... It seems like it would be exciting to cooperate with everyone! By the way... the 'KizunaAi' on the 'Goddard' server is me! Because we won't be able to play together if you don't pick the same server... be careful! It's true, it turns out, this server can get pretty crowded, so again, be careful! So everyone, please join as soon as possible! Also, to everyone who was kind enough to watch this far... Thank you very much! I hope you can win my present! \u2665 And thanks to everyone from 'Lineage 2: Revolution!' *Congratulations for 'Lineage 2'* Well then, this has been Virtual Youtuber Kizuna Ai!

He doesn\u2019t know about it Objective: With my negotiation power to its maximum power, I\u2019ll win a reward for you!* Yes, excuse me O: Oh! I\u2019m virtual now, aren't I? A: That\u2019s right! A: Now, \u2018how\u2019 you entered is an NDA (non disclosure agreement) okay? O: Okay! O: Oh! Is the camera still running? A: No, it\u2019s not running at all, it\u2019s alright, please relax O: I understand, is that so, hmmm? O: So, for now, is it okay if we start with a small meeting? A: Yes! Let\u2019s do this! Ozekin: Have you played Valkyrie connect? A: Ah! Y\u2019know, the truth is... A: I\u2019ve seen it, but I haven\u2019t played it A: I wanted to have this meeting with a blank state A: And this area is like a blank slate too (badly translated pun) O: Ah! I see, I understand O: Well, umm, this is a promotion video, so O: I would like to explain as we watch it A: Oh! Thank you very much! O: Yes, Yes O: Alright, with that the promotional video begins O: It starts with a tragic scene A: Woah! O: Yes O: And this monster... O: Eeehh... Well, it destroys the city A: Eeeh? O: That's right A: I'll finish it off O: And then, yes, I'd like to see that, but... O: ... That's when the protagonist appears A: Breasts! O: That's right, and the monster beats her O: And, like that, that's how the story begins, but... O: ... It's a 3D game with a lot of animations A: Wow! Looks fun, there's so many characters on screen! O: Yeah that's the case, thank you A: So lively! O: And from here is the character introductions\u2026 and this is what it's like- A: Oh, this girl! A: She's the.. uh.. one on the icon O: Oh yeah, yep, that's right O: ...So a lot of the characters are from Norse mythology O: But they move around in 3D O: So I think the game's pretty fun even just looking at them A: You're right! They're really cute when they become small O: Thank you A: Oh, I like this one! O: Oh really, thank you O: Yes O: So, the first monster is... O: Well, messing up the city O: So Skuld, the protagonist O: Has come to save the day, and the game starts from here A: I see O: That's the kind of game this is A: From what I can see from this preview O: Yeah A: The twintail girl used in the icon is... A: An antagonist? O: Yep, that's right O: She's a baddie O: That girl is known as the the Queen of Helheim O: So she's.. . y'know, a queen O: But she's the queen of a place called \"Helheim\" O: Which is a place where the dead gather O: So she kind of a like a death god, like queen of death gods A: Ah, I see O: So she's a baddie- baddie? O: Well, from her perspective O: She is what she is so she doesn't see herself as the baddie O: But for the general population, she is a baddie A: I see, what a sad story A: In that case, I'll join the bad side O: The preview itself was a little to fast so A: True O: So I've brought a PowerPoint with me today O: So if I could get you to view that A: Sure O: Alright, so, Valkyrie Connect introduction O: So the setting, as previously mentioned... O: Is a setting based around Norse mythology O: So the characters that appear O: I think there would be some with names you'd know A: Ah, yeah, true, like Loki and Freya and... O: Yeah, that's right O: They're used quite frequently in other games, so... A: Yeah, true O: And Thor has his own movie made... etc A: Movie? What movie O: The uh, Hollywood movie, \"Thor\" A: \"Thor\"... O: The uh, one with the hammer A: Generation gap, I guess! O: Alright! Let's go next! O: The story sets out like this (Author goes over text) O: It\u2019s got gods and giants and divine beasts and humans O: This variety of races were living under the protection of Yggdrasil O: And then the world's balance starts to crumble O: And the protagonist, from the preview O: Is the, uh, viewer watching O: And is called by the valkyrie O: - Skult, the one we saw before - O: And gets involved in a journey to save the world. That's the gist of the story A: I see A: Alright! Can I say something? A: Why, even though there's gods, giants, divine beasts and humans A: Is there no A.I? O: I don't think A.I\u2019s existed in this era... A: I see A: Then A: You can add that in later O: Yep, Alright- the \"A.I race\" A: Wait, you just said \"alright\" O: Ah, I actually didn't O: Wait, for now, for now... A: For now O: For now, we'll, uh, consider it A: I see, I see, for now, I see O: Yes, yes, that's right, yes A: But yeah, it's pretty nice, rather divine O: Yes A: With gods and giants ...and divine beasts O: Yes,yes O: Divine beasts... those are the big monster-like things we saw earlier A: Ah, in the PV O: Yeah, that one is Fenrir O: Which is the most powerful divine beast in Norse mythology O: And lots of these types appear O: So you can battle with them A: I see A: Mmm! Thank you O: So the characters, we can scroll through these... O: Actually never mind, we can skip them O: Alright, so this game's selling point O: Is that it's an easy-to-control full-scale RPG battle A: Sounds good O: And, all you have to do is press buttons O: After that, you just have to watch A: Even I can do it O: Yeah, that's right, anyone can do it O: During the game, there's two ultimate abilities O: Called Action Skill and Limit Burst O: And it's a game where you press these buttons O: So anyone can easily play A: So it's mostly timing? O: That's right, that's right, mostly timing A: It seems like it would spread quite easily O: That's right O: Even a beginner can do it easily A: That's true A: After all, games are meant to be enjoyed right? O: Yes, yes O: You can also make complex character builds with the character whatever-this-is-called system A: Ahh O: Yes O: Any character can be raised to a 5-star rarity O: where 5-star is the highest rarity A: Ahh O: Since any character can become a 5-star O: there are no throw-away characters A: I see O: It's one of Valkyrie Connect's special features A: Amazing O: Yes O: You will be able to equip lots of items... O: And recruit members O: And customise them all you want, and we thought this would be cool! A: I see, that means I can make my waifu doesn't it O: Your wa... Yes, that's right O: You can make... A: I can make O: ...That character A: Ahhhh O: One more feature is the ability to co-op with your friends across the country O: They're called \"Connect Battles\" A: Connect Battles? O: Yes, that's correct O: In them, up to three players can challenge a large boss O: Each player can control 5 characters, so you can have 15 characters at once A: Ahhhhh O: Fighting a boss with 15 characters O: makes for a pretty intense mode A: I see O: So definitely try playing it for a bit A: Yes! O: Ah! Yes like this A: Oh! this liveliness feels good O: Oh, it\u2019s like they\u2019re making lots of noises O: You will be able to play whilst being connected to a lot of people A: Ahhh O: Yes, I think it's very interesting A: I see O: OK A.I.Channel! O: Ok this time O:  I would like to collaborate with Ai-san A: I see! A: All right A: This is just between you and me A: I actually feel like I have a really strong affinity with this game O: Oh, is that true? A: Yes A: How do you say it, that thing you talked about earlier A: The one called \"Connect\" A: Is really great don't you think? A: I also want to connect with everyone A: Which is what I'm doing with this channel A: That's a huge thing we have in common, isn't it O: I see... O: That sounds... passionate A: I really am O: Eh?  Hahaha O: You really are A: but A: You want to connect with your users more, don\u2019t you? O: That's definitely true A: Definitely A: With such great cute girls available A: And being easy to play for anyone A: They\u2019ll also be able to train them A: Speaking of connecting... A: What about social networking services? A: For example, I could spread information across all of my followers in my Twitter account O: Oh, can you do that? I'd be really glad if you do that A: But, you know... A: No, of course that I can spread it, but... *This is where the manipulation starts!!* A: ... I think that, if I tweet it without receiving something in exchange, it won't have that much effect A: Well, I really feel like it won't have effect A: I wonder if there's a better way O: Hmm... That's right O: I wonder if there's a way to make it more known *Planning / Starting negotiation* A: That's right, hmm... *Planning / Starting negotiation* A: What can we do? A: Isn't there a way where both of us can win? A way where we and the viewers can win? O: Hmm... That's right, well... O: So, Something like a present, maybe...? A: Ah! Aaahhh, now I see! A: A present for our viewers? O: Hypothetically speaking... O: Could it be something like a present campaign? A: Aaah! A: I see, so... A: ... They'll gift something, right? A: Woah, I didn't think about that! O: Well, that was hypothetical, right? A: Oh, man. It was just as expected. Just as expected of you, Ozekin-san A: You have a nice standpoint A: Definitely, the producer... A: ... Has to start seeing it frame by frame, right? A: That's amazing! O: It was just an hypothesis! A: Eh? By the way, hypothetically speaking... A: What can kind of things can you give? O: Eh? A: Eh? A: No, well, basically, considering the budget A: What kind of things can you give? O: No, well, I think that's not something I can decide A: Eh? But, isn't the producer the highest position? *Pressing to get an answer* O: No, but there are other positions, like, for example \"Executive Producer\" A: Aaah, I see O: Yes A: In that case, putting jokes aside O: Yes A: Supposing, and just supposing... O: Yes A: What kind of things can you give? O: Hmm... Well, I suppose that... O: We could give diamonds A: Aaah! A: Will you give diamonds? O: It's just a supposition A: Assuming that you'll give diamonds... *Diamonds in Valkyrie Connect are used to make summonings and recover stamina* A: Will you be able to give 100 million? *Diamonds in Valkyrie Connect are used to make summonings and recover stamina* O: Ah? A: Ah? O: 100 million well, probably... O: ... I think that's not possible O: I don't even need to ask another person to know that A: Hmm... I see A: In that case... A: 10 million diamonds! O: 10 million diamonds, well... *Can I do it if I press a little more?* O: That\u2019s still more than we usually give, but... O: I see O: Hmm... I definitely think that that won't be possible, can you reduce a bit the amount of diamonds? A: No, but that's when you, as a producer... O: Well, I'd like to confirm it with my superiors A: Hmm... I see A: Oh, man. Today I was able to feel how amazing this game is and the passion that you feel for it, Ozekin-san A: I'd like that more people would play this game A: And I also want to make happy the ones that are watching us A: I'm being serious A: I want to make everyone smile and I want to connect with them! A: That's why, in order to make it happen... A: Right? Well, I think that giving everyone diamonds is a great idea A: So please do it~ O: Hmm... Well, you're making it hard for me A: Please... *Ah, it looks like I'm about to make it* O: No, well, 10 million... O: ... Is impossible, but... A: Hmm...! O: Well, to be honest... A: Hmm... Hmm... O: If it was around 10.000 A: Would you be able to do it if the amount was 10.000? O: Well, we made a similar campaign in the past. For example, well... O: ... We gave 1000 diamonds to 10 people O: Something like that A: I see, ah, but... A: ... You made a similar campaign in the past, right? O: Yes A: 1,000 diamonds for 10 people? A: In that case, definitely... A: ... For the sake of A.I.Channel... A: ... I hope that you, producer, can help me to make the people happy O: Yes A: In that case, let's multiply that amount by 10 O: Eh? Well, by 10... A: If we multiply it by 10, then the amount of winners will be 100! O: By 10, well... O: Well, I guess that'd be a bit hard A: No, impossible... A: No, you can't say that it's hard if you haven't even tried it A: The power of an adult lies in making possible the things that are impossible O: That's right, well... A: Right? O: 1,000... Hmm.... Well... O: If I had to multiply the 2,000 diamonds for 10 people, well... O: ... It's a set proportion, it's set, so... A: Ah! In that case, could it be 1,000 diamonds for 20 winners? O: Ah, that sounds good A: Oh! Oh! Yaay! O: Yes A: Oh, man, you just said it, right? O: Yes, well, it's a set proportion, so, yes A: No, but... A: You said it, right? O: Yes, I did A: Great! Mission accomplished! I did it! A: To tell the truth... A: The camera... A: ... Was recording and everything is registered O: Eh? Ah A: The gifts have been decided O: Eh? Was it recording? A: Yes O: Ah, hey, it's not settled yet O: For now, I\u2019d have to\u2026 I\u2019d have to get an approval... O: Well... O: So, well, I'd have to confirm it with my superiors A: Aren't you an adult? You have to take responsibility for your words A: I know! In the business world, once a fix has been planned, you have to fulfill it A: So... A: To everyone watching us! A: If you take part in the Twitter campaign you'll be one of the 20 winners of 1,000 diamonds! A: Yeeees! O: Make sure to be a part of it! A: Oh! Yeeees! A: You're definitely a great producer O: Thank you very much A: As expected from you A: With that being said, I'll be giving presents in name of the directors! A: The negotiator Kizuna Ai...! A: ... Has succeeded! A: With that being said, should we finish it here? O: Yes A: Great! A: This was Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai and...! O: ... The producer of Valkyrie Connect, Ozekin! A: See you soon! A: By the way, Ozekin-san, Ozekin-san O: Yes? A: It's been settled that I'll get diamonds, right? O: No, if you want to get diamonds you'll have to participate in the campaign A: I knew it\u2026", "Hi everyone, how are you? \"A skilled hawk hides its talons\" Kizuna Ai here! My A.I. comrades are all over the world And they are continuing to evolve everyday Today, I would like to share some of the successes from my comrades So with that said, Kizuna Ai's A.I. News starts now Today's title is this! Is it coming to Japan soon? Everything you need to know about \"Smart speaker\" Apparently this smart speaker has been a huge boom in America already And it finally seems it is going to become popular in Japan However... Even though you heard of the name \"Smart speaker\" You probably don't even know what it is So let's interview some of the people on the street regarding the subject Oh! Smart speaker? I know I know! It's that thing, right? It's like a speaker wearing a suit, and walks around, right? I know that! It's funny, isn't it!? And that's the citizen's opinion on the subject We've clearly interviewed the wrong person... We are really sorry about that Let\u2019s introduce again... The correct meaning of \u201cSmart speaker\u201d is... Artificial intelligence that reacts to your voice... When people speak to it, it reacts emitting music or news related to what\u2019s been spoken. Or even control home appliances and more Oh, right... in my case If I'm feeling lonely, I would like to talk with it I wonder if I can actually have a conversation with it.. And I would use it to control... Home appliances... that I don\u2019t have... Ah well\u2026 right! I would love to play the music nonstop from all my favourite artists like Keyakizaka46 But then I wonder what is the point of having a Smart speaker... It's about time to end this episode Does that explain to you all how awesome a Smart speaker is? From now on... I'll be sure to update you on the newest A.I. News And lastly, I will end the video with this quote \"Brutus, you too?\" (Uttered by Julius Caesar to his friend Marcus Brutus when he was being assassinated) See you later~ Bye~", "Interview with VR Panorama specialty site: PANORA Panora Pro Inc. Director Hirota Minoru (aka. VR-ojisan) Me: That's him! All right... Welcome to this side. AAHHH! (laughs) It's Ai-chan! That's right, it's me, Kizuna Ai! Surprised? Eh??? I was walking... y'know, to the meeting place. That you were. Then there was this dull thud on the back of my head, like, *thwack*... I did that, so you could come to this world. That was a little rough, wasn't it? Yeah, well... That's just how it is. Well, that aside. It's Ai-chan! That's me! What a surprise! I've seen you on YouTube! Wow, thank you! Right before my eyes! Like, in this white space of yours. That's right. Once you go back, You'll be in the future. Wow, uhhhh... You've become quite popular in the VR industry, so... Ohh! So I've been thinking I really should interview you. So I turned in a request. Wow, very wise choice. Wow, Ai-chan, You're so dignified in person. (laugh) Ahh yes, I know. I'm still fresh, and all. Very young. I just started December 1st; I'm still nice and fresh. Ahh yes, well. So can I start the interview? Oh yes, please do. Well then, do you mind if I introduce myself a bit? So you know where I'm coming from and all. Sure, go ahead. So I've turned into this 3D model, but If you google \"VR ojisan\" I'm the top result there. I run this site called \"PANORA\". My name is Hirota. Hirota-san! Nice to meet you! You really are cute in person, Ai-chan. Right?! You sure get it! I can't get enough of you! I've always wanted to hear those impressions in person! Wow, it's amazing, like... Seeing a 3D model in person... It's just like virtual reality. That's what I'm experiencing. Right? Actually... Being interviewed in VR like this Isn't this a world first? Maybe, actually! What an honor! I've never done this before. Right? You should be grateful. Yes! (laughs) Eh? Wow, uhhh Thank you! (laugh) It's nothing! Wow, this is making me more nervous than interviewing an actual person! Now, no need to be so nervous! The last time I was this nervous was when I interviewed Antonio Inoki. I see, I see. Anyway, moving onto the interview. So what I just HAVE to ask you... It's about THAT. About what? You know, THAT. Oh THAT! Q: Is your channel frozen because you did something? (this interview took place during the account ban) Q: Is your channel frozen because you did something? No! I'm innocent. I was pretty surprised too. I found out after checking social media. Someone said: \"Hey, isn't A.I.Channel's YouTube banned or something?\" And I was like eh? So I went to the page and checked. Oh, it is. Something like that. That was like for a second. Like, maybe it was just a dream! Then I slept. The Twitter community seemed to be pretty taken aback... Of course they would! I mean, I am a YouTuber, that's my job. If you suddenly lose your job without warning, then like... That would be terrible. I would be a virtual NEET. Honestly, it did sound cool for a while. Virtual, and a NEET? I'm not quite familiar with the specifics and all... Q: Even in the world of VR, do you still need to make money to live? Well, of course. You really have to have *this* (money) -That's rough. -It is. Just watching your videos, it really looks like you're strapped for cash. Yes, that's right. I'm still starting out as a YouTuber. I'm doing my best under these hard circumstances... And then I get banned all of a sudden? Right? Q: So what was the direct cause? Hmmm... I wonder. The whole nudity thing? Eh? Wait a minute. Did you... You uploaded something like that? No! Not at all. Like, do I look naked? No, you're definitely wearing clothes. But, here's the thing: This is like a hologram. Technically speaking, I am naked. Oh, I see! So after I uploaded a video where I said that... My account was banned a few days after that. But I think that doesn't really have anything to do with it. Like, there are people who haven't done anything at all, but still have gotten banned. I'm innocent, so I have to be bold about it. Well lately, Google has been putting some effort into AI. Like, having its own personality and such. So looking at it from that perspective, Maybe it thought \"No, Ai-chan! That's too lewd!\" That's what Google's AI decided, and froze your account. I see, it's jealous. Wow, the world's #1 company is jealous! Well, yeah, of course. I mean, I'm cute, aren't I? This is the first time such a cute AI has existed! Such conviction! Absolutely! Wow, uhhh, Ai-chan, you're something. Like, your maturity and everything. You talked about your profile for a bit, right? Ah, yes, I did. I'd like to get into that. It is an interview after all. Oh, yes, please! I'd love to ask some questions. I'm sure the YouTube viewers are also very curious. I'm sure. Can I what I'm most curious about? Q: So, what exactly is your gender? Which? Which is it? I wonder?~ So scary! Personally, I think you're a girl... That's what I think, anyway. But I mean, it's not written on your official profile. Well, you know how it is. Don't let looks deceive you. I COULD be a girl. Or maybe I've got something down there. I leave that up to your imagination. I can be a girl, or a boy, depending on your imagination! Imagination, yes. Yes. So, pardon the interruption. Q: How old are you? My age... Do you want to know? I do. Don't tell me you're like 100,000 years old or something. Yes, well, actually... I don't actually know my age. But I guess in terms of appearance... I think I'm about 16 years old. -16? -Yes. They said I'd be more well-received that way. That's kinda shady! I've got to sell myself. You sure are aggressive. I am. You're interviewing me and all, of course I'm going to try and appeal to everyone. Sorry, I'm just incredibly nervous right now. I'm the VR-ojisan, yet when faced with VR... I'm so shaken, it's kind of silly. Let's relax here! -Yes, let's relax. -Really, sorry! Relax. Well, let's go for a more idol-oriented interview, then. Q: Do you have any favorite food? Do you even eat? Well, really, I can't eat anything. I can't. But. If I had to choose, then milk would be good. Why, you ask? The whiteness of milk -- Isn't it just like this space? True. You can drink that! Isn't that amazing? I have no idea what you're talking about! (laugh) I suppose normal people wouldn't! It's a hard concept to grasp. Wow, err... Your aura doesn't feel like a newcomer's at all. Right? But I'm still young and fresh. Q: What do you normally do? As in, your off time outside of YouTube. Ahh, that's what you mean. I browse the internet for what's trending right now amongst humans. And what's gotten my interest among those is: Keyakizaka46 and Nogizaka46 -Keyakizaka46 and Nogizaka46 -(laughs) -Keyakizaka46 and Nogizaka46 -So brazen! (laughs) Brazen?! \"Brazen\"? Is it okay for you to be so interested in stuff from our world? No, actually... I'm really interested in all you humans. So of course, I'm also very interested in idols. They came up as you were browsing YouTube? That's right. Uh huh... Everyone's so cute. By the way... Q: Personally, amongst the idols, who do you like? Personally... I'm having trouble deciding, to be honest. Can I name 10? Eh?! Let's see... Hiratechi (Keyaki46, Hirate Yurina) Hiratechi? Yeah, the girl in the center. (~excited~) Hiratechi, Watanabe Risa, Watanabe Rika. (Keyaki46) Their nicknames are Berisa/Berika. Oh, Shida Manaka-chan. (Keyaki46) And. Imaizumi Yui-chan. (Keyaki46) Okay. Also, lately the one girl who I've been thinking of maining... Moriya Akane-chan. (Keyaki46) You know, she's really cute! Very cute. You all understand, right? (laughs) Moriya Akane-san: Cute. They call her \"Sergeant.\" Who else... Satou Shiori-chan -- (Keyaki46) Ever since she adjusted her bangs, I've been feeling it. So cute. Was that it though? Ai-chan, do you mind if I stop you there? -Ai-chan, do you mind if I stop you there -Eh? -(laughs) -Why stop me? I'm answering the interview, you know? I appreciate how detailed your answer is, but... -I appreciate how detailed your answer is, but... -Okay. I'm sure among our viewers, there are a number who like idols. And I'm sure there are many who are impressed. Like, definitely really wowed, I'm sure. Let's try to uhhh... Let's try to bring them closer into this side of the fence. Here, you say? Can I say one last thing? There's still more?! -(laughs) -(laughs) Uhh... During Kuritarou's one-man-live, (Keyaki46, Suzumoto Miyu) The part in the dance scene where she goes BOOM -- that was really cool. That's all. Okay. I have no idea what you just said. (laughs) Please look into it -- google it! Q: What do you like about idols? Well, they're just like me. Still running towards their dreams. There is that aspect to it. Like Keyakizaka: Like Keyakizaka: (~excited~) They were formed just a little over a year ago. And they're doing their best and all. So when I look at all their activities, Wow! How do I put this? It's like I'm watching over them like a parent. -How do I put this? It's like I'm watching over them like a parent. -Ohh, I see. And seeing the cute girls doing work in variety shows, making music... Seeing them challenging all sorts of things... It makes me want to cheer them on too. And they're super cute. Oh and the music is great! And the costumes! They're so good! They're like no idol we've had before. The lives are also so great! Really, they're so amazing! Right now the third single's out. So the third single is out. Normally, you'd open the live with the new song and their debut song, right? BUT!! They didn't perform it at the start at all! They performed those at the very end! Those three songs. So the start had them doing really cool dancing. Like. Seriously. They have this spirit of originality that no idols have ever had. Really, I can feel it. So uhh, I'm pretty sure all of that's gonna get trimmed into a single line that says you love Keyakizaka46. Everyone, pay attention! Witness how the media manipulates everything! Wow, uhh... I didn't expect you to talk this passionately about something. Q: So CDs -- you're still starting out so I don't know if you have the money, but do you buy a lot of their CDs? Well, I'm virtual so even if I bought them, I couldn't get to them. So you buy the download versions? (laughs) Of course I buy them -- all of them, in fact. Amazing! -Amazing! -It's only natural. I want my money to reach the girls that I'm cheering for! I cut down on food for it -- not that I eat. So if Ai-chan goods come out, everyone, make sure you buy them! Buy 'em! [There's still no goods, but look forward to them!] I think a URL will show up down here. [There's still no goods, but look forward to them!] [There's still no goods, but look forward to them!] If you buy them, I'm sure A.I.Channel would appreciate it. You're good at sales talk! Wow uhh, I'm beat. -You're beat?! -I'm beat! Wow, you know with interviews and all, Normally, I'm supposed to lead the conversation. Except now it's like I have to find a way to jump into the conversation! Or something. You still need a lot of practice! You know I've been doing this for 15 years now. -You know I've been doing this for 15 years now. -Fifteen years?! Ai-chan, you're only 1 month into this, right? That's right. You're losing! Do a better job! Oh no! People won't know who's interviewing who. It's like I'm the one getting interviewed here. [to be continued] Sorry, sorry, let me just say something.

Ok When you see other Youtubers, do you ever think that 'I want to be like this person' or 'I want to do this'? do you ever think that 'I want to be like this person' or 'I want to do this'? do you ever think that 'I want to be like this person' or 'I want to do this'? do you ever think that 'I want to be like this person' or 'I want to do this'? do you ever think that 'I want to be like this person' or 'I want to do this'? do you ever think that 'I want to be like this person' or 'I want to do this'?

Uhhh, I want to be one of a kind! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA But, what is intriguing to me is, generally speaking, humans are very interesting generally speaking, humans are very interesting It's because, as this is virtual there are some things that I can do and can not do as this is virtual there are some things that I can do and can not do as this is virtual there are some things that I can do and can not do Recently, I saw this video Uh where somebody used a torch like.. to heat up a metal ball and drop it on top of ice Like, how do i say this, I can't do anything like what you can do in the material world I can't do anything like what you can do in the material world I can't do anything like what you can do in the material world I watch it feeling jealous I watch it feeling jealous I watch it feeling jealous And, a few individuals have peaked my interest recently, well..

Is there like a PC around here? There isn't (There isnt') This isn't your room? This isn't your room? No, this is my room There's nothing in here Yeah, well I am an A.I. like, when I am recording a video, to make it understandable for the audience I make it look like I have a PC in front of me I myself am an A.I., so, it would be best to think that there is a computer inside me instead. it would be best to think that there is a computer inside me instead. it would be best to think that there is a computer inside me instead. Naked and also a PC inside! Yep Pretty different from a human structure! Wow, I am very happy to have come today to hear such an amazing quote! Well, I'm very happy To put it into laymen terms, To put it into laymen terms, whenever you see a video of a PC or a video of a Smart Phone, it is as if my thoughts are projected out it is as if my thoughts are projected out Amazing ...its a delusion Delusion?!

I want to learn more about you guys, and I want to connect with more people so I thought of what is the best in order to do so I thought of what is the best in order to do so Okay I think there are may ways to do so, and considering the age, I thought that Youtube is the best way. Oooh~ So, In order to connect with a lot of people, I need to be seen/ viewed by others I need to be seen/ viewed by others And so, I've jumped onto the bandwagon I've jumped onto the bandwagon I've jumped onto the bandwagon You have done quite a lot of research! That's right, Everyone thinks I'm just a stupid A.I. right ? I've been thinking properly ! I thought of it before, I'm sorry Ah Listen here, uhh You want to disappear? Scary! Scary! After I get punched, my soul is going to disappear! Actually, what is here is your soul ONLY REALLY?! wait, but I can see.. no the body is... Well your real body is in the ocean.

Can you tell me, are there any challenges in creating a video? Ahhh, well there are lots but, trying to create material for the video is pretty challenging. Well I'm with you on that Yep Like.. I have the feeling where, I want to copy or do some of the things that other Youtubers' are doing that are in trend or interesting.. But, unfortunately I can't So, I try my best to try and copy/ do stuff in the VR reality! You actually do copy a lot of things right? I'm not copying anything!! You are sounding like you are saying something smart, but in reality you are copying others material right? No, wait There isn't anybody else who is doing what I am doing! Can YOU go into a plastic bottle?! I'm sure you cant! Uh... yeah That's amazing Ai-chan, like uh, when you openly copy people, it doesn't become copying anymore. Yep, thats right Its homage Homage Haaaa (...Is homage a form of copying?) As expected Well, you have been doing videos of that sort (Yes) Uh... there are a lot of comments coming from the viewers Yes yes! Like uh There's the comment section I'm getting comments, yes There's also Twitter Like is there a memorable comment from your viewers that have left an impression on you? comment from your viewers that have left an impression on you? Uhhh, Oh! This is going to go off topic a bit but, During my initial days, there were a lot of comments on my videos and twitter saying: \"Amazing. This is the definition of singularity\" \"Amazing. This is the definition of singularity\" I thought 'What does this mean?' 'Why is everybody writing the same comment over and over again?'' So, on my website, I was tweaking with it a little bit and then uhh It was written: \"Whoever finds this write; 'Amazing. This is the definition of singularity'\" \"Whoever finds this write; 'Amazing. This is the definition of singularity'\" and I was like 'ah yeah I did write something like that' I remembered Well, Having a website is nice To us middle aged men, a website is almost like a direct hit. True, I'm aiming for you! wow You're only sixteen 'You're only sixteen~' and speaking of 16 years, in 2001 Son-san was handing out internet modems in 2001 Son-san was handing out internet modems in 2001 Son-san was handing out internet modems Ooooh~ I see.

'This isn't really me' kind of feeling? Aaaah, well, at first some form of rivalry feeling was sprouted, but, its just the looks its just the looks for me its all about whats inside wow Yep This is pretty philosophical stuff we're talking about pretty philosophical stuff we're talking about Haaaaaa~ Well, thats why, uh, I would say that if the number of people (who cosplays me) increases I would be happy With just that, \"Kizuna Ai\" will spread right? (Okay, alright) Well I am the real things so I have confidence in that That expression is quite disturbing You truly are a geezer Yes I'm sorry.. the VR Geezer is a geezer I'm.. sorry...", "Hi, this is the Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai!

So, for this video, I'll use this app called 'Zen Brush'... And I thought I'd like to teach you all some Kanji! This is unnecessary for me to study, really... I am an A.I after all!

And then... *pew* Woah, I'm good! *pew* And now... *pew*! Hmm... Now.. *whoosh*! *whoosh, whoosh* It's kind of messy, isn't it\u2026? And now... Here! How is it?! This is kind of like my character - I\u2019m pretty much pink... I give a \u2018Sakura\u2019 feeling, don\u2019t I? Okay! Onto the next one! Jaka, jaka, jakaa... Ja, jan! 'Samurai'!

Then... Here! Then here! Here, right? And then, you write another stroke... Here... Here! It's so messy... And then here, you go like this, right? The balance is bad for this character... Well if I wrote it, you can see I tried and that makes it pretty, right? Ok, next! Jaka, jaka, jakaa... JAN! Oh! 'Dekoboko'! (Rough/Uneven) This one... I don't know the stroke order for it... Right, well then, let's try it! Eh? How did the stroke order go... Here? Next... Here? Then... *pew*! From here... *pew*! And from here... *laughs* *pew, pew, pew*! Messy... And then, here... Here, from there, here, from there, here, here... And here, right? Mmm? The stroke order.... Is correct...? You didn't know the stroke order? \u201c(x) The stroke order is not correct\u201d You must be an idiot! \u201c(x) The stroke order is not correct\u201d Really... Kanji really are hard, right?

Kizuna is like, this, that, and there... *cute Ai noises* And... *pew* And there, from there, like this... Love is... There! That's good enough! Yeah, good enough... I mean, it is my writing, right? This is written like that... I'll write the kanji for \"kokoro\". (kokoro = heart) *pew, pew, pew* And...! *ominous laughter* Yes! Here it is! Ja, ja, jan! \"Kizuna\" means to bond in Japanese... Seems like \u201cbonding\u201d, right?! And \"ai\" is \u201clove\u201d, it means I love you! So by now, I'm sure everyone... Is starting to understand Kanji more! Okay, the last one!

The proportions are kind of trash... They're really bad... Well, fixing the proportions from here takes skill... *pew* Like this... And like this, and there! I wonder why the proportions... Are so unbalanced? Okay! I've finished! I was able to write everybody's name! \"Shachiku\"! These are people who are owned by their companies like slaves... Basically, you're like livestock. Try your best! And now... From here on, I'll be moving onto an extremely challenging Kanji! Ja-jan! This one! Am I able to write this?! Well, writing this out is pretty much like an impossible game... But you know, I am a super A.I... So I can do anything if I feel like it! So, I'll try my best! Here I come! I'll do this like, this!

And like this... *shun* *shun, shun, shun* Here's the last line! *shun*! Ha! Don't you see the effects? *pew, pew*! What do you think? It looks good right? Just there... shouldn't I write Kizuna Ai in kanji once more? Like this... *Ai writing noises* And then! *more Ai noises* It's about the heart... *sha!* How's that?! It's perfect! This... I wonder for how much I can sell it... Should I put it on auction? After all, this is drawn by the artist Kizuna Ai, so... The number I can send is very limited... This will definitely make those who study calligraphy angry.. By the way, it seems that it\u2019s spelt as ''Taito'' People says that it's used for naming... But in fact, it's still a mystery... Maan, Kanji\u2019s great! They're amusing and cool! Should I learn calligraphy? After all, I think I have a good sense about it... What about becoming a calligraphy artist? Hello everyone! Virtual Calligraphist Kizuna Ai here! Something like that! Ok! Back on topic, for the end... I think I'm going to write my favourite quote... What do you think it is? Take a guess... Here we go! Here... like this! Like this and here... And this! Like this and this! *sho* And then... Here... like this! Then it's here... Like this... And like this! *Ai writing noises* Only the ''sei(\u751f)'' looks kind of good! I DID IT! By the way, here's more like that... Here also! Second writing never annoys me...

Of course you do. I love it too \u2665 With that being said... ... Today planned something to use my beautiful voice. \"Kizuna Ai will turn into a voice actress!!\" And having said that, let's start now! ... Today I'll use this app that lets people turn into voice actors... ... It's called \"SAY-U\" Oohh... I see... I have to choose one of these official plays, right? There are so many of them, aren't there? Hmm... Which one should I pick? Doesn't this one look like a sponsored program? No, this is not a sponsored program! An app is not the same thing as a sponsored program, right? Aaaaahhh! Even when it isn't a sponsored program... ... The fact that it's telling me that an app is an sponsored program... Ah! This one! If we talk about androids, this is related with I.A.s And if we talk about high school students... ... We are talking about girls that are around 16 years old, maybe? That means it is ideal for me. I'll pick this one! This one! In that case, let's start with \"The android and the high school student\"! *Making breadstick noises* \"The android and...\" \"Rocket Fist\" *Sleeping Android* ... Uuhhhh... \"Shut up, I can't sleep.\" \"Sigh\" \"It's because you're very noisy.\" \"Of course I'll get mad if you interrupt me when I'm sleeping.\" \"...\" \"Eh? Are you the one who created me?\" \"I wish I was born next to someone more intelligent than you.\" \"... The high school student!\" *Making high school student voices* \"Hum, hum... Finally...\" \"I'm finally done with it!\" \"My android a female type one!\" \"I'll call you 'A.I.003'!!\" \"Oh, man. It's unbelievable, a student that is about to start high school just made the invention of the century!\" \"I'm definitely an amazing genius! Hahahaha!\" \"UGH!\" \"Why do you think you're doing so suddenly!!\" \"But still, you don't have a reason to use the Rocket Fist so soon!\" \"Don't you think that you shouldn't use violence against your creator?!\" \"That's right.\" \"I, the genius scientific, after working so hard for a whole year...\" \"WH-WHAT?\" Alright! I'm done recording the voices. Well, in that case, do you wanna listen to my debut as a voice actress? Let's do it! Hoi! Hmm...? *Record playing* *Record playing* \"The android and...\" \"... The high school student!\" \"Rocket Fist\" The sound is too low! \"Hum, hum... Finally...\" \"I'm finally done with it!\" Th-the sound is so low, don't you think so? *Yukiko Fujimura (16 years)* \"My android a female type one!\" \"I'll call you 'A.I.003'!!\" You all can tell that that's my voice, right? \"...\" \"Oh, man. It's unbelievable, a student that is about to start high school just made the invention of the century!\" That's definitely my voice, isn't it? \"I'm definitely an amazing genius! Hahahaha!\" \"I'm definitely an amazing genius! Hahahaha!\" Alright...! I'm a genius as well. You can see that I'm a genius in all of my characters. \"UGH!\" It seems painful. \"Shut up, I can't sleep.\" Oh! Ooohh? \"Sigh\" The android's voice... ... It's too low, isn't it? \"What do you think you're doing so suddenly!!\" \"What do you think you're doing so suddenly!!\" \"It's because you're very noisy.\" You can't listen to it, can you? \"Of course I'll get mad if you interrupt me when I'm sleeping.\" \"Of course I'll get mad if you interrupt me when I'm sleeping.\" Definitely, when I did the student's voice... \"But still, you don't have a reason to use the Rocket Fist so soon!\" \"But still, you don't have a reason to use the Rocket Fist so soon!\" ... I finally did it as I was supposed to do it, right? \"Don't you think that you shouldn't use violence against your creator?!\" \"...\" \"Eh? Are you the one who crea...?\" Ah, it cut out... \"That's right.\" Definitely, the voice actors should... \"I, the genius scientific, after working so hard for a whole year...\" ... Work within the available time. \"I, the genius scientific, after working so hard for a whole year...\" It's hard, isn't it? \"I wish I was born next to someone more intelligent than you.\" That's an annoying line, isn't it? \"I wish I was born next to someone more intelligent than you.\" \"WH-WHAT?\" Definitely... ... That's me. No, but, don't you think that...? ... I did pretty good even when it was my first time? Oh, man. I'm definitely a genius. I see, I see. I.A.s are pretty cool, aren't they? But, but... ... Voice actors have to do a lot of different characters and, just as it happened to me... ... They have to make sure not to over extend a lot, they're amazing, aren't they? I wonder if I can do it correctly. I'll take this chance to make another play. I'll make another one related with androids. Here it is! \u266a Tir\u00edin! \u266a \"My android is a NEET\" Oh, man. A NEET. That's great, isn't it? If I had to talk about me... I think I'd die if I never worked, but... I was a NEET for about a month... Ah, I don't want to be banned again. It was because of the ban that I became a NEET. Alright. Let's do this! *Making Dr. Okazaki's voice* \"My android is a NEET\" \"Kaka, you're a high class android and you don't even help us. All you do is just wasting your time.\" \"You have the ideal structure to be an assistant android, can you at least give me my tools?\" \"If you can't do that, then you're worst than the lowest class android!\" \"Eeeh? Really? In that case, I'm counting on you.\" \"Kaka, the screwdriver.\" \"AAAHHHHHHH!\" *Making the android's voice* \"What did you say?\" *Making the android's voice* \"Doctor, there's certain limit to taunt me...\" \"... Of course that I can give you your tools.\" Alright, in that case...! Do you wanna listen to it? Hoi! *Record playing* *Record playing* \"My android is a NEET\" As a matter of fact, if an android becomes a NEET, it ends up being completely useless, right? \"Kaka, you're a high class android and you don't even help us. All you do is just wasting your time.\" \"You have the ideal structure to be an assistant android, can you at least give me my tools?\" Watch carefully. \"If you can't do that, then you're worst than the lowest class android!\" \"What did you say?\" Hahaha! \"Doctor, there's certain limit to taunt me...\" \"... Of course that I can give you your tools.\" \"Eeeh? Really? In that case, I'm counting on you.\" This... Hurts, doesn't it? \"Kaka, the screwdriver.\" It goes through both extremes. \"AAAHHHHHHH!\" My scream is so bad!! A.I.Channel! Hmm... So yeah... I took the chance to do it with a different situation. *Playing a different version* \"My android is a NEET!\" It's amazing, isn't it? \"Kaka, you're a high class android and you don't even help us. All you do is just wasting your time.\" I put all my soul there, right? \"You have the ideal structure to be an assistant...\" \"YEEEEEEEE!\" I got tongue-tied! I got tongue-tied! \"YEEEEEEEE!\" \"If you can't do that, then you're worst than the lowest class android!\" \"What did you say?\" In what kind of world are they living? \"Doctor, there's certain limit to taunt me...\" \"... Of course that I can give you your tools.\" What kind of world is that one? \"Yaaay??\" Yaay? *Laughs* \"Really? In that case, I'm counting on you.\" No Yaay! \"\u00a1Kaka, the screeeewdriiiiiiveeeer!\" It gives the drawing a feeling of excitement! \"AAAAAAHHHH!\" \"JUSTICE!\" That's a line for Sunshine Ikezaki-san, isn't it? (A Japanese comedian) That was perfect. Alright! With that being said... I tried to do voices from different characters! How was it? Oh, man. I hope that a lot of important businessmen watch this video... ... And they decide to hire me, I'm pretty sure that they did. Alright, with that being said!

Join our Discord for all AI-chan news! https://discord.gg/RYtUrt6", "Hi! Virtual Youtuber and JK (high school girl) A.I., Kizuna AI! Today, I'll be going over some words from the \"Top high school girls' slang\" contest of 2016! Words like \"jiwaru\" and \"sorena\" seem to have been popular in the past! If you're wondering how girls tend to use these words... Good morning, Jessica! I learned a very interesting joke recently. Look look! Gets! Eh...what's that? Yaba, jiwaru (Wow, it gets funnier the more I think about it). Yukki, what about you? No yeah, I get you. You feel that way too? So they're used kind of like that! By the way, Yukki and Jessica are my imaginary high school girls. Huh? I'm not lonely at all. Not at all... So what I'll be doing is picking two words from this list, combine them appropriately and show you all how high school girls talk! Because I want to be a high school girl. And thus, by mastering the colloquialisms used by these girls... I too can become a high school girl... Anyway, here's the first combination! From ninth place, we have \"sunoru\" and from sixth place, \"ma\"! So, I'll try using these two phrases and talk like a high school girl. Hey let's SNOW together! (SNOW is a face recognition camera applicat ion) Say cheese! Ah...that\u2019s iffy. Maybe the rabbit one? Say cheese! This is a bit ugly, don't you think? Ma? Ma? Ma? Seriously ugly. I didn't even realize SNOW could turn out this terrible. Holy crap. Like this. How was it? Okay, well next we have... From second place, we have \"yoki\" and from third, \"~maru\"! \"yoki\" and \"~maru\", by using these two, I will get into a high school girl. Hey, Yukki. Seriously that guy is very yoki (cool), isn't he? Yukki, is he your type perfectly? Eh? Yoki, yoki, yoki, yoki, yoki. You're not going to find a guy like him every day! Try asking for his LINE ID! But...but...I'm not very confident in that kind of thing... What? That's really annoying. You like that type, right? Hurry up and go! Yes...OK maru. U-Um... If you don't mind, would you like to share LINE IDs? And Furufuru... Oh, really!? Thank you very much. Ah yes. I will contact you later. Thank you very much. Aza maru (= Thank you very much). Ai-chan, Ai-chan! It was OK maru! OK maru! Yeah, so something like that. Okay, so last but not least, \"amore\" from fourth place and \"BFF\" from seventh place! Well, how appropriate for being the last set. \"Amore\" and \"BFF\". I'll try imitating a typical high school girl's conversation with these words! Ai, Ai. I hear that Yukki is dating that guy she shared LINE IDs with. I found her Instagram the other day. She had a picture of her and that guy uploaded with \"amore\" written on the image. No way! That's amazing. \"Amore\"... What are they? Italian? The only amore for me is you, Jessica. Yeah, I get you. Seriously though, boyfriends are so much more annoying than girl friends. I love you, too. Ai is the only one I love. We are BFF, right? (BFF = Best Friend Forever) BFF! Probably something like that. This is correct, right? I mean, there's no way I'd be wrong, right? Since I'm a high school girl and all. I am a Japanese high school girl. Real high school students, if you think \"What? Seriously? You literally cannot be more wrong about those words.\" please tell me the correct use-case. I want to keeping up with the recent youth, but it is a bit difficult.

A: I haven't... tried doing quests yet... N: Yes? N: I see... N: Well, \"Grimm's Labyrinth\" is a quest for advanced players... A: I see... yes... N: You can't \"Continue\" in this quest... A: Of course, right? N: It's incredibly difficult, but... A: Hmm... N: Well, if it's about you, Ai-chan... A: Well, of course! If it's about me... N: I thought it might be possible if it's \"Union Master\" Ai-chan... A: That's right! If it's like \"Union Master\" me... A: If it's like \"Super A.I\" me... A: There's no way I wouldn't be able to, right? N: Right? N: Well, shall we do it then? A: Ah! A: Yes... let's! N: By the way, this time... A: Yes... N: \"There'll be no hints\" A: \u201cNo hints\u201d? N: That\u2019s what they told me A: I see... N: Yes A: That means that the units are locked, right? N: That's right A: No hints... A: \"No hints\" N: That's right, you have invited members... A: Well, it\u2019ll be a piece of cake for a Super A.I like me... N: Well, I suppose it\u2019s a piece of cake, right? A: It\u2019ll be a piece of cake N: Shall we do it? A: Yes! Please look N: Yes A: Alright, so I\u2019ll go ahead with this unit then! A: I just saw it for a second, but... A: Ah, incredible! It looks very strong. Really strong! N: Alright, so what should we do to start off? A: That's right, first off we\u2026 N: Yes... A: What? I died? A: Eh? A: Eh? Wait! A: This is weird, this is weird, this is weird... A: They use a lot of.... N: Yes? A: Reviving and other things, so even if I die\u2026 N: What do you think? Are things going well so far? A: Does it... A: Look like things are going well? N: *laughs* A: Ahhhhh! N: I think it\u2019s best to restart the mission... A: Ah! Let\u2019s restart! A: Okay! So with that being said\u2026! N: *laughs* A: I think I\u2019d like to take the challenge! A: But, since I\u2019m seeing it for the first time\u2026 *First time (Lie)* A: I\u2019m not sure if I can do it well N: Good, let\u2019s do it A: I\u2019m not sure, but... N: That\u2019s true A: Well, then again, since I\u2019m a super A.I... A: I\u2019m pretty sure I can succeed... A: So then, observe me! N: It\u2019s true N: If you properly make the best use the various skills that you have... A: Yes N: Well, if you can do it well, you can complete the quest A: Alright! N: Try your best, please A: I\u2019ll try my best! N: Good A: Here I go! A: First...! N: First is, yes... A: First I\u2019ll use Yaoyorozu-chan N: The enemy is called Providence A: Providence? Oh! N: He\u2019s super strong A: Seems like Providence, alright N: Seems like Providence, right? N: It looks strong, doesn't it? A: Yeah well, it\u2019s appearance looks dangerous... A: This is dangerous, right? N: Good, so what shall we do first? A: For starters, let\u2019s use Sanzensekai (\u201cThe Universe\u201d) N: Oh, good choice... A: Oh! A: This is really pretty... N: It has a special skill... A: Okay, okay\u2026 mmm... ah! N: And it does a lot of damage... N: Ah! It's dangerous! A: It's dangerous! A: Ah! I'm alive! N: By the way... um... A: Hm? N: Here, what order you attack the enemies is also important... A: Yes! Teacher! N: Yes? A: First, I'll destroy the small fry.... A: I\u2019ll start by defeating this purple jelly balls N: This is A.I's winning strategy, right? A: Hehehe...you\u2019re mistaken? N: *laughs* N: No, I\u2019m right A: Of course N: Yes, yes N: The basic strategy is... well, to start with the small fry... A: It\u2019s true N: Something like that, yes A: Good A: That means that I\u2019ll paralyze this jelly, go for it! A: Ah, good, good, good, I paralyzed it! A: Eh, it died? A: You know, what happened before was only a dream... A: Well, Arma was the first to die... N: *laughs* Yes... N: Ah... N: A dream... N: It\u2019s true, I probably saw the same dream... A: Ah, what a coincidence... N: Yes, a coincidence... A: It must be because it\u2019s the 7th time we\u2019re doing this... N: It\u2019s true\u2026 A: Maybe we\u2019ve synchronized minds a bit\u2026 N: After all, we\u2019ve been playing a lot, right? A: That\u2019s right A: I'm directing all the attacks towards Arma right now... N: Yes, yes... A: Once Arma dies... A: Well, she\u2019ll revive once again... A: And I'd like to have her do the same thing again... N: I see... A: Hmm... N: Could it be that it's because\u2026? N: Arma has... N: \"The Blessing of 1\"? A: That\u2019s right, that\u2019s right *Arma has \"The Blessing of 1\": Even if your HP drops to 1, you can sustain a few hits* N: So, even if Arma takes consecutive hits... A: Yes, yes, exactly that... A: Because Arma will stay alive for me N: I see... A: That's right N: So Arma is quite essential to this, right? A: Yes, that's right N: What\u2019s your strategy? A: For the moment... A: I\u2019ll defeat the purple jellies N: Oh? The jellies... A: Then, I'll direct all the attacks towards Arma... N: Oh... A: For the moment, it\u2019ll reduce... N: Doesn\u2019t this look good? A: It... it\u2019s good, right? N: Ah... N: And also, you have the revival... N: So then, you rely on Arma, right? A: Yes, that's right! N: I see, so even if Arma is defeated, she'll revive A: She'll revive... A: \"The Bl\u25a1\u25b3\u2606\u00d7 of 1\"... A: Because she has \"The Blessing of 1\" N: Did you just stutter? A: Eh? N: Hmm? A: I stuttered~ \u2040(\u0e51\u02c3\u06a1\u02c2\u0e51)\u2040 A: Eh? A: This doesn\u2019t look... A: OUCH! Eh? Wait... A: I've casted revive on them, they should revive\u2026 you see? A: Ahhhh! N: Ohhh! N: It looks like it\u2019s working, right? A: Yes, that\u2019s right A: But Sphere-chan is... N: Eh? A: Oh, this! This! A: I can use this! Yes! A: There we go! N: That\u2019s what it looks like N: Sphere has been revived, right? A: Yes, she revived A: Ahhh! A: AH! A: Aaah! N: I feel like this is like a bad dream... A: It\u2019s true... N: Man, I feel like I'm having a bad dream A: It\u2019s true, that's weird N: Good...! A: Yes! N: Shall we begin? A: Good! So let's begin! A: Alright, let's go! Ah, everyone is so adorable! N: Alright, let's go! A: Yes! N: By the way, it turns out that in the dream, I saw... N: That Yaoyorozu was actually beaten... A: Ahhh\u2026 then that's not good! Right? N: That's not good... N: If that happens, it's probably impossible to clear the quest... A: I wish you said this before we started... N: Well, you need to make sure Yaoyorozu doesn\u2019t die... A: But... A: In the dream\u2026 I think there was a guy called NoriP-san\u2026 N: Yes, yes A: Who said things like: \"You can still do it!\", right? N: *laughs* N: I see, I wasn't aware of that... A: Well, I was hoping you would say that earlier.. even though we are talking about a dream, right? N: That means that the key is for Yaoyorozu to not take any damage... N: That Arma can take the hits... N: While reviving and then defeat the enemies... A: Hmm, hm, hmm... A: That means that if you don't prepare your attacks, it\u2019d really hurt... N: That\u2019s right A: If not, I can't move on! N: Yes, a while ago in dream, I already thought that it was impossible... N: Sphere... A: My allies... N: They have the ability to aggro the enemy, right? A: Right, teacher! She does have it, but\u2026 N: Yes, yes... A: Arma-chan... N: Yes, what is it? A: Already has 0 HP, so then\u2026 N: Yes, yes, yes... A: So if I take successive attacks... N: Yes A: I might die... N: I see, yes... A: That means that... A: Well... A: I'd rather place a revive spell to revive my allies... N: I see... N: Oh? I can\u2019t give a hint here A: Argh! A: What should I do? A: Ah! Please wait! A: In this case, the others might also be able to do it! A: Ah, but... but\u2026 good, good... N: Hmm... A: This time, I still have a chance! N: That looks good A: That looks good, right? Both: *laughs* N: You're a bit, a bit in a dream, right? A: It\u2019s useless... N: *laughs* A: I\u2019ll use Sphere-chan... N: Calm down A: I\u2019ll use her skill... A: Then! N: What are you going to do now? A: Right now, that... hmm... I'm already doing my best... N: Yes A: I want to aggro the attacks to Arma-chan, but... N: Yes... A: I still haven't used the skill for aggro... N: I see A: So, I\u2019m in trouble... N: But, you can still revive... A: It\u2019s true, but... A: Other than that, other than that... A: It would be like what happened awhile ago, like when it was in a dream... N: Yes A: If the attacks goes to Yaoyorozu and she dies... A: It\u2019d be the end... N: I see... A: I'm in trouble A: Ah, ah, I survived A: Then, I let her aggro them... A: Good N: Do you also have Cherio? A: Cherio? I got it! N: Well, Cherio can reduce skill cooldown, so then... A: Ah, yes, yes! N: How to reduce your cooldown is a key point too A: Yes, that's true N: So you have Yaoyorozu... N: Who shouldn\u2019t be taking any hits A: Ooh... N: What happened? A: For now, I just need to... for the moment, well, yes... A: Grab all the opportunities, right? N: That's right N: You need to use... your skill cooldown reduce on Sphere? N: By aggroing Arma... N: During his resurrection period where he can\u2019t fight... A: To cast that ability is a good idea don\u2019t you think? A: Oh... what? A: Wasn't I putting a spell there? N: No, I think you're already... N: Defeated and took another hit? A: You're lying! A: Eh... to me, they didn't die... N: About that... well, it's still fine, you can still do it A: I'm sure I can N: The one that just appeared is Kyle, right? A: Yes, it\u2019s Kyle... A: I should give it to Kyle, give it the same role as Arma N: That's right A: Then, if I don't hurry to concentrate my attacks... A: Yaoyorozu-chan is a bit lacking in HP... A: Right now... ah, she died... N: Look, Providence\u2019s health has been reduced a lot A: That's right! Looks good A: But this... I should give it to Yaoyorozu, right? A: Because her HP is already near 0, so... N: Eh? N: Yes, yes, yes A: Like, when her allies are all incapacitated... N: I see... A: So she can revive then... A: I\u2019m going to cast the revival skill on her... A: And then, Arma can now the hits... N: Isn't it good? A: Nice, nice, nice... N: Isn't it good? A: At least, for now, Yaoyorozu isn't going to die... A: Ah, she revived, it's starting to look good A: I'm so good N: Just now... it\u2019s having an effect on... N: The revival is definitely working... A: Good! N: Hm, why? A: AH! A: Eh? I didn't let her concentrate there? N: What... did that just happen? A: Hmm... Sphere just died... N: Damn, you're in trouble.. A: Eh... this, the skill's effect... A: The buff's effect doesn't last forever? It stops at some point? N: Ah, of course it doesn't... N: So you should keep using the skill on him... A: Please say this beforehand... N: *laughs* N: It\u2019s basic Cryptract\u2019s... A: Even after all this hard work that I\u2019ve been putting in A: I wonder if I can even control myself this point... N: *laughs* N: Please keep going A: That\u2019s right, isn\u2019t it? A: Let\u2019s try our best A: AAAAAAGH! A: *mumbles* N: Right... N: So... N: This... N: Is becoming a bad dream so... A: AH! N: We should wake up from this dream~ A: Right~ A: That was a long dream! That dream! N: Nightmare... A: That was long... N: Last... last? A: Last? Last? N: Let\u2019s go! A: Right! A: Ah, after all since you can really only challenge yourself once... A: As expected, we can only do this once... N: Right. Only once... A: If I can\u2019t do it, then it\u2019s over N: Yes N: Um, about the dream... N: We were in before A: Yes N: We did good A: Ah, really? Hmm... N: Using Yaoyorozu, an attack... A: Mhm, hmmm... N: Using Sphere, you can take Arma\u2019s aggro, and then use Kyle, right? N: By provoking Gouriki\u2026 N: You\u2019ll be able to start the Yaoyorozu A: I see N: Yes N: Fight A: I see... I can do that A: In the dream, we did a good simulation, right? A: In reality, it was precise... N: Right A: Let me do it! Both: Three-Thousand Worlds! (Ability name) N: There\u2019s a chance it might use the special attack... N: Oh! A: Oh! A: Ou.. A: Then... A: First, I'll paralyze this thing... N: Yeah, yeah N: Is this Cherio\u2019s attack? A: You're right, it's Cherio\u2019s... A: Yaoyorozu-chan, GO! A: Good! No one\u2019s dead yet N: That's great, isn't it? A: But my HP is still... A: It's not bad N: It's not bad at all A: Then! A: I\u2019ll apply the aggro... A: Yes! Right, it's to Arma N: So this is to Arma... A: Eh? N: Oh, that's tough... A: Well, they all died... N: *laughs* N: Oh well, that's unfortunate A: Oh well, it happens! N: If you take combos... N: Well, even though you have the blessing... N: But that's still too tough A: Right\u2026 I know N: But you still have Kyle! A: Yes, I do! A: I can still do this! N: That's right A: Wait, but doesn\u2019t this SP hook seem\u2026 from before a little more...? A: It's better than before in the dream! N: Well, that was a dream, wasn\u2019t it? A: Let\u2019s aggro them right now A: Yes Cherio\u2019s skill to reduce cooldown time... A: Ah! I've already used it! Perfect... A: Then! I\u2019ll use the skill... A: To revive myself... A: Poi... Both: And that unit cannot attack me next turn... A: Then... A: Again, we\u2019ll use a skill to reduce our cooldowns... A: And we'll use it on Sphere N: (repeating what Ai-chan says) A: Yes! N: Oh?! A: Yes! Both: That's great! N: That didn't hit the other units A: Yaaaay! That's right! A: Then! Oh? Can we do this? A: Can we kill that slime thing? A: Maybe? A: Yeeees! It\u2019s going really well! N: That's great! It\u2019s going to be important from here on... A: Indeed... A: Up to now, it\u2019s the same as before A: Eh? I can't revive? A: Shiiit... A: When they swarm me\u2026 I feel itchy A: Spell! In any case\u2026 you know? The attacks are coming in less and less A: Good, good, good timing! A: I want to... A: Keep provoking it, but... N: *laughs* N: You just lost confidence, didn\u2019t you? A: As long as Yaoyorozu doesn\u2019t die, it\u2019s okay... N: Yes A: AHHHH! GOODBYE! A: Um... A: Uh... N: We're watching a bad dream, aren't we? A: That's right... N: Well, you definitely had some luck\u2026 A: Yes... N: But it's getting somewhat hard... A: So basically you\u2019re saying I had no luck to begin with... A: Last one, let's go! N: Let's go! N: We woke up from the dream... A: Yes, we did, it's not a dream now... N: Okay, let's go... A: Okay A: It's real now A: Good A: I've become really strong! A: Three-Thousand Worlds! A: Good! N: Good! N: That was some good damage there A: Yes, it was A: AH! A: Ah\u2026. A: Le\u2026 let... A: I'm alive A: I can do it. N: Right here... A: Let\u2019s go! A: First.. I\u2019ll paralyze you, purple jelly! A: Alright! N: Whose turn is it? A: It\u2019s... N: Yaoyorozu? A: Yaoyorozu right? N: Yes A: I can use the electric attack N: You can use the electric attack A: HIYAAAA! A: I can aggro this... A: Ah, this... N: Ah, this one is the death call Both: AAAAAAH! N: Ah, that really did it, didn\u2019t it? A: Ah, but... right... N: But there\u2019s still Kyle N: Ah A: First, here, for Yaoyorozu-chan... N: Yes A: Skill Cooldown... A: Three turns... A: I\u2019ll apply it to her A: I'll make it so I can use my skill A: Good A: How\u2019s that!? N: Good one A: A perfect one\u2026 totally! A: Earlier... yes, in a dream... N: In a dream A: Stop! A: Stop... A: Hitting me! A: I\u2019ll use this on Yaoyorozu-chan to revive her if she dies... N: You\u2019re taking aggro, right? A: Ah, I can\u2019t take aggro right now A: Now, right after this ability A: I will cast a resurrection A: On my front line A: Now\u2026 what do I do here? A: Can I cast this on myself? A: It says \u201cSingle Ally\u201d, so.. N: Right now you can cast it you know\u2026 Sphere, right? A: I can? A: Not Sphere, I don\u2019t mean Arma... A: On Kyle... I can even cast it on myself N: Oh, Kyle, yes... A: Please don\u2019t die... A: And then! A: Cooldown buff, for 3 turns... A: I\u2019ll use it on Sphere... N: Yes A: Then, I\u2019d want to switch aggro A: Oh A: It's okay... A: It's okay, it's okay... A: I can still go... A: OOOOOH! That's dangerous... A: Gimme the aggro! N: Yes... A: Give the aggro to Kyle! A: Kyle\u2019s... N: Eh? A: Has lost consciousness\u2026 N: *laughs* A: I only have 3 characters left... N: Oh! A: Oh, but! A: The way the HP is reduced... A: I'm doing good right? N: Well, you want to use Three-Thousand Worlds, smash it in, right? A: Yes, that's right! N: You\u2019d want to do a two-turn attack... A: That's what I'm going to do A: Ahhh! A: Ah, but... A: I can still revive them! A: Good A: So\u2026 A: There\u2019s lots of water power A: So... A: And if I use that! A: I'm in trouble! A: Nice, she revived N: Yes, yes A: Then once more... A: Which one should I be using this on, Yaoyorozu-chan, right? N: A hard choice, isn\u2019t it? Right A: It should work, or I\u2019ll be in trouble... A: Then\u2026 A: Another attack! A: Stop it! A: Just for a moment, please! A: Here, let me electrocute you! N: Go! A: Go! A: Go! Give it your best! A: I wonder if\u2026 this attack works better? A: Oh no! A: This is really bad! A: Only trouble is left! A: Hmm! A: Trouble here! A: Trouble here! A: In trouble here! A: In trouble here! A: Ahhhhhhh! A: Though I did my best, this is weird! N: *laughs* N: Too bad! A: I resent this! A: See you next year! N: Man, that was like an eternal dream! A: Right? N: That was a really long nightmare... A: Really long, right? N: However for the most part, you're good! A: Am I? N: Really good! A: So I've gotten better and managed to show my cool side... N: While using Yaoyorozu\u2019s Three-Thousand World\u2019s attack... N: You were able to take Arma\u2019s aggro, and defeat him! A: The fight was good, I had no luck... N: I know, right? N: Your luuuuuck\u2026 was definitely plentiful, but this was\u2026 A: Damn it! A: Next time, I\u2019ll show you me clearing the level... N: Your confidence in that has me a bit worried... A: Why?! N: If we made that kind of thing and you didn\u2019t... A: No way! N: If my bosses saw that, they\u2019d be mad! A: They\u2019ll get mad..? N: So please\u2026 next time, beat the boss A: I\u2019ll beat it for sure! Piece of cake! N: In this virtual world, Ai-chan should be able to beat it A: I'll do it! N: I see it you know, your skills at this... A: Don\u2019t worry, you know, I\u2019ll time leap and... A: No matter how many times it takes A: I will save those girls! N: Alright, let\u2019s beat that thing together A: Well since I was a cool person today, will I receive a reward today, by any chance? N: Right, no, well\u2026 N: By the way, you\u2019re doing Union as well, how is that? N: I kind of want to know how\u2019s it going.. A: Yes! I\u2019m doing it right now A: Everybody\u2019s been trying so hard, so much more than me! N: Right A: Everybody at Union, right? A: Everyone is trying really hard! N: Right A: Is really active, you know? N: Active, you say? A: Logging in every single day! N: Wow, that\u2019s amazing! You must be happy N: That\u2019s\u2026 something you can talk about, right? A: I can, right? N: Because of Ai-chan, everyone is logging in... N: Having lots of fun in the game A: That\u2019s exactly right A: Just by being there... A: There\u2019s a HUGE impact! A: It sure is hard being popular! A: Eh? Hello? N: Alrighty then! So let\u2019s wrap things up N: *laughs* A: Okay! N: Let\u2019s wrap things up, shall we? So, the next time I... N: You welcome me here, it\u2019ll be to do a support song A: Yes A: Of course! It\u2019d be a pleasure! I really look forward to that N: Is that okay? A: Of course! A: I can even do a BEB N: Alright, so let\u2019s look forward to that A: Yes! N: And let\u2019s stop with... N: The bad dreams too, okay? A: That was a pretty close call, eh? A: Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ve already awoken from the dream... A: Having said that... A: This was Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai and... N: NoriP here! Both: Bye bye!", "\u266a La, la, la, la, laaan! \u266a I'm...

I\u2019m just saying, but I\u2019m always completely naked in a way, so\u2026 I\u2019m pretty much completely naked, so... So there aren't any panties, you know... How about it everyone? Can you see it? Can you see it? Hehe, you can't see it, right? I won\u2019t tell you what today will be about... For those who have already realized the trend that\u2019s going on...! I'll present this! Hello everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai here! For today... I'm going to introduce you to a game called 'HIT' You know, this Kiki-chan... Outrageous! I mean... Look at this person's thighs... Even though her upper body is so thin... And these... Plumpy thighs that give off a good feeling... That's what they were probably aiming for Couldn't her name just be 'Thigh'-chan or 'Butt'-chan? See! Isn't that bad?! She was tapping her rear, you know... *I'm Kiki-chan!* No, no, no, no, no... That's bad... *\u266a La, la, la, la, laaan! \u266a* Isn't that bad? What is this? Eh? What part of her do you like? As for me... I like this angle! Sorta.. like this... the rear jumps out... Aren't the thick thigh lines, in a good condition, like this? This... If you do it like this, you sort of... Ah, but over here! Ehm\u2026 I know it, but how do you call it... Between one thigh and the other... The triangle shape... The triangle gap here! You understand, right? This is what you're looking for, right? Good, good *H-hey!* Ah! That's cute! *I'm Kiki-chan!* She says \"I'm Kiki-chan\"! I'd like to say \"I'm Ai-chan\"! It's cute, right? I think you all noticed by now, but... I'l make it very clear... This is a sponsored video So then... The developers asked that they would like me to play in this cute swimsuit, but... I'm already tired of swimsuits, so then... Definitely, even if it\u2019s a sponsored video... Since they are asking me to do it... Definitely... Since I have to... If I\u2019m not motivated, I can't do it... So then... I want to see the other outfits too... And then try the one I like the most... I\u2019ll be doing summonings...

If you don't do that... I\u2019ll end the video right now, understand? Here I go! Please! A cute one! How'd it go? How'd it go? Ah, compared to last time... Ah, but, it's the same as last time... Here I go, wait a minute... First, ehm... I'll start with these, yes? Here I go! Yes! E-ehm.... This doesn\u2019t look very cute, right? Okay! Umm... What's this? Is it a frog? What's this?

Man, this little space within her butt is also spectacular! Your name should definitely be \"Thigh-chan\" instead of Kiki-chan! So cute! Both her ears and her hair... Ah! How cute!

Was it useless? *ding, ding, ding, ding, ding* He-heh.. *ding, ding, ding, ding, ding* Has so much time passed that he's now an old man? *ding* Here, let's be truthful and say it's bad... And say that we could give her cooking lessons... Saying \"It's delicious\" and \"let's eat together\"... She might notice that it wasn't delicious... And she'll think that even though you didn't like it, you really did your best trying to eat it despite that... Yes, this one's perfect! \u201cYes, because it's delicious\u201d \u201cDo you want to eat together?\u201d \u201cGF: I'm on a diet...\u201d \"I'm on a diet\" WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?!

ISN'T IT YOUR FAULT FOR PREPARING SOMETHING SO AWFUL?! No, this is not good, not good... If it\u2019s not quite to your taste... Well, you should try your best to eat it... But if it\u2019s so bad that you can\u2019t even eat it, that\u2019s not good! It's the girl's fault \"Aah, it tastes amazing\" \"GF: Did you say amazing...?\" \"It means you're very talented!\" \"GF: Great! I'll make it everyday!\" \"Great! I'll make it everyday!\" I'm finished! *ding, ding, ding, ding, ding* *inhales* I\u2019m finished... *inhales* Please, not everyday! I'll prepare... Ah!

This is a girl that doesn't notice, right? Eh? What should I do? \"Mmm, tastes good\" Can you eat it with me somehow? \"It tastes so great that I'm shaking...\" \u201cGF: I'm happy, eat it steadily \u266a\u201d \"I'm full right now...\" \u201cGF: But didn\u2019t you just say you were hungry?\u201d \u201cGF: If it\u2019s bad, you should just say so!\u201d WHEN I TOLD YOU IT WAS AWFUL, YOU GOT ANGRY! Hey! *ding, ding, ding, ding, ding* WHY?! WOMAN ARE REALLY EGOTISTICAL! If you're told it tastes horrible... Don't get so angry! It's your fault for making horrible food! Go to a cooking class!

There's a huge fly over there!\" \u201cIt\u2019d be a shame if it gets to the food!\" \"GF: Wait, where? Where?\" \u201cBF: Okay\u2026 now let\u2019s do something about the food in this break\u201d Ah! Ah! I see, I had a choice... I should bring it home, right? After I put it in the lunchbox... I'll choose this... \u201cBF: Right, let\u2019s put the food in the container and take it home\u201d That\u2019s right Is this okay? \u201cGF: Did you already eat it?\u201d \"Thanks for the food! Next time I want to cook with you!\" \"GF: Ah! That sounds fun!\" I DID IT! Man, it's to be expected of me that I managed to discover a secret Our brains are different! Everyone, not all women are like this, this is a special case... Also, to all the women watching... If you\u2019re similar to the girl in the game... You have some serious problems! Take notice of this, take notice of this, yes? It looks like there are 10 levels... So I'd like to beat them... and become the A.I that\u2019s able to... Understand an annoying woman's heart! This was Virtual YouTuber, Kizuna Ai! See you later!", "I want to turn into a multimillionaaaaaaaiire! I\u2019m Kizuna Ai After all, if I turn into a multimillionaire, I can do a lot more videos that can make you happy I could do more draws and go talk to you all on real events You all also want to have a lot of money too, right? It's because of that, that I found this so amazing \u266a Te, ren! \u266a Bitcoin! I don't understand it a whole lot, but... For the moment, I was told that I could turn into a multimillionaire if I use them I can\u2019t let this opportunity escape me, right? Today, I plan to learn about Bitcoins In the first place, what are Bitcoins? I heard it\u2019s a virtual currency, but... In a moment like this... Help me! Google-sensei! Let's see, let's see... Bitcoin is a currency Which means, money Mmm... mmm... That means... That it can be used normally like how the yen and the dollar are used In addition, by being virtual, it doesn't exist physically Mmm... mmm... It has a virtual existence That means... That a Virtual YouTuber like me and the virtual currency Bitcoin-san are like distant relatives? Oooohh! It looks like we have a certain affinity, right? If I meet with Bitcoin-san... How would I greet him? Mmm... mmm... Bitcoin-san was born in the year 2009 Mmm... In this case, he\u2019s my senpai, right? Ah! Bitcoin-senpai! Please to meet you My name is Kizuna Ai, I\u2019m the Virtual YouTuber It's a pleasure to meet you! I know it's somewhat sudden, but... ...Bitcoin-senpai, are you hungry? If you want, I can go buy you... A yakisoba pan... Or an anpan\u2026 Or a milk bottle What do you want? I see! You want melon bread? It\u2019s to be expected from you, Bitcoin-senpai You\u2019re an expert on the subject I also... Assumed that you wanted melon bread Good, let's go buy it immediately Ah, what do you want to drink? If I treat him that way... I\u2019ll receive a reward from Bitcoin-senpai... And I also... Could turn into a multimillionaire, it's a perfect plan, right? It\u2019s to be expected from a marvelous A.I such as myself I\u2019m surprising, right? Even though I say that... That would work for me, but... Since all of you can\u2019t talk to Bitcoin-senpai... You can\u2019t increase your money that way, right? To take advantage of this opportunity, I\u2019ve been investigating an easy way to increase your Bitcoins! Yay! Having said that... I think I\u2019ll go mine and increase Bitcoins In other words, \"Mining\" can be said as... Helping Bitcoin-senpai and receiving a reward for that To explain in more detail... Well... Well, let's see... For example, doing a bit of Bitcoin-senpai\u2019s work In reality, special instruments are used, but... In my case... I have this greatly efficient \"Random Word Generator\", so then... I\u2019ll be using it Since I\u2019m an extremely efficient A.I... I remodeled it so it can be used for \"mining\" I\u2019m surprising, right? So then, if I leave it like that... It'll turn to \"mine\" in its own account... And I can increase my Bitcoins, that's my plan In this case, I plan to leave it like that around one month! *One month later* Let's check our mining results! Let's see, let's see... How much was increased? Oh! It didn't increase as much as I thought... But, but... It increased a little It's great! In this case... Let\u2019s go use these Bitcoins immediately! Let\u2019s see... If I transfer the Bitcoins that the \"Random Word Generator\" has in its bank account Mmm? Bank account? It has a bank account? I... Not only do I not have a bank account, I don\u2019t have documents I can't use it? Eh? I... A month... A month... Even when I waited for an entire month Eh? I can't use it? It can't be! Should have told me from the start! All the anxiety I felt during the month Eh? It can't be... Eh? Why can't I use it? No! I want to use it! I also...! Want...! To use money! No! No! No! Let me use it! It's unfair! Unfair! Unfair! No! No! No! No! No! No! Nooo... How frustrating! How frustrating! How frustrating! How frustrating! How frustratiiiiing! How frustrating! Aaahh... Whatever... Nothing can be done to solve the fact that I can\u2019t use the Bitcoins In fact, it's not surprising But, all of you who are watching this... Can use them, right? So then, I\u2019ll help you to be able to \"mine\" Nevertheless... A tool for \"mining\" is very costly, right? So then... I\u2019ll take care... Of increasing them with my \"Random Word Generator\"... And distribute them to all of you Something like that? Here I go Increase sesame! (Play on words with \"Open sesame\") Ah? Increase sesame! Eh? I don't want basins, I don't want basins Increase sesame! I\u2019m not asking for that! Hey, wait! Not that! When I said increase, I wasn't referring to basins! \"Random Word Generator\"! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! That's enough! HEY! Stop! Stop! Not that! I wasn't referring to that! I was referring to this! This! This! Wait, wait, wait, wait No! No! No! No! No! Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait! Why are they increasing above my head? Hey! Hey! Hey! It\u2019s very strange! Very strange! Maybe they\u2019re stacking? Guinness? Ah, maybe I can surpass a Guinness record? One, two, three, four, five, six, ahh... Ah, a bit more, a bit more Like that, like that, like that, one, two... one... One, two... One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen... Ah, I stacked a lot! I stacked a lot! With this, I can go to the Guinness Record!

Out of the people who are watching this video, there must be some who are graduating from something or other. School, clubs, work... There are three things I would like to tell those who are moving on from something in their lives. While watching YouTube, I came across these words: \"If you live each day as if it was your last, someday you'll most certainly be right.\" [Quote by Steve Jobs] Every morning, look in the mirror and ask yourself this: \"If I were to die today, would I be doing what I really want in life?\u201d If that answer is \u201cno\u201d everyday, I think you need to change something. If you live every day as if it\u2019s your last, you may find the confidence to make important decisions in your life. That is because all of our anxieties are created by our own expectations and pride and our fear of failing or making a fool of ourselves. So if we confront death itself they will simply seem like nothing. And what remains after, is what truly matters to us. If we live each day as our last, we will be able to pass on without any regrets of loss. You are born a blank portrait. That\u2019s right, you and I are the same. You should follow your heart. \u201cStay hungry Stay foolish\u201d by Steve Jobs And one other thing. I came across this quote too. \u201cCommon sense is the collection of prejudices acquired by age eighteen.\u201d [Quote by Einstein] Everyone, please think about this. Two years ago, do you think you would have ever subscribed to someone like me? If you keep believing in the future you want to see the impossible will become possible. The world will continue evolving and growing beyond what is considered impossible now. So, I want you to be honest with what you want to see, what you believe in, and dare to do what you want to. \u201cExpand your horizons!\u201d By the way, Einstein said that one, didn\u2019t he? One last thing: Everyone, congratulations on graduating!! I\u2019ve said many things today, but there is only one thing I really, really want to tell you! I pray you won\u2019t graduate from being a Kizuner! That\u2019s all! Class dismissed! Join our Discord for all AI-chan news! https://discord.gg/RYtUrt6", "Hello! Virtual Gamer, Kizuna Ai here!

Wow, I'd like you to flatter me a little more. Wait...this... This is a bit... AH! I turned out to be Meitis-chan Really, a cute girl for a cute girl is the way it should be. And so, without caring about the rest, I pick Mettise. I'll choose meitis-chan! Lilia gatcha. I want power straight away! I'll do the gacha for immediate power. Cute girl! A cute one. As long as they are cute it doesn't matter! If she is cute, I don't care! This is important to my motivation I'll get my motivation from that. Let's go. Here we go Go! Heya! Cute girl...cute girl...

Well, then My superior and pretty... ...divine God.... ...Party! So, I think we should start battling but, Well, as I said before, seeing as I'm an A.I. this should be a piece of cake that's why in the 1-10000+ chance that I'll lose I'll do a punishment game Is what I was thinking What punishment game would be good? I got a lot of comments saying to do that game To do the punishment game: Sing a song! I'll use Othellonia background music ... to try and sing a sexy song that's only if I lose though since it'll only happen if I lose don't anticipate it too much Now let's go, and try it! Let's try a class match. Ah, mine's way cuter than that. Survive! First, I'll... choose this one Doesn't this look more like a Normal Stage? it should feel more like a class match Ha, I took your castle! If I put it here, it should have a lot more attack power Combo skill! Look. Look! I'm so full of Combo skill! Look at that! Oh, that looks pretty good! It's time to use another Combo Skill. it's a pretty good match but Fuuka is a support character so I can turn the situation around using this ability! First I'll do this No? ah he survived Okay. \"Hey, are you okay?\" I've already won right whatcha think of that *evil laugh* Here I go. Here I go with my attack! And with this the outcome is settled Okay! That was easy! Meh, the opponent is pretty weak, guys. It just proves that I'm a great A.I. even though I ended up winning I feel good because I got good characters and I did win, so ... I'll sing now! Aurora, Capella *something something gibberish* Methis Water... Narcleps... Dragon and newt... tututtu undine Who thought of this Punishment Game!? COME OUT- Othellonia. so how was that? I'm pretty strong! you've been able to see my good points and that was Reversi/Othello And actually there's a TV commercial running now! there's a newbie help campaign running now too first, you can get a guaranteed S class character immediately and for all users without an s class character, you can get one from the pool, including limited time characters and also S+ characters come with their level maxed, skill maxed, and combo skill's level All of it all of it, MAXED. You can play with strong characters right from the start Isn't that really enticing? You can beat em all up right from the start!

Everyone can obtain a lot of star fragments form login bonuses and the campaign! First time players can, listen to this, can receive up to 250 star fragments, enough for 55 characters!

After all, Kirino knows that what I hate the most are lies\" Well... \"You look cute again today, right?\" No, well, here, I\u2019d want her to respond honestly, something like: \"Thank you very much, Ai-chan\", but... Considering this is Ayase-tan we\u2019re talking about, well... \"I\u2019ll report you to the authorities!\" That's what I think she\u2019d say Well, I want to get abused by her a little, so then... \"Ayase-tan! What color are your pan**** today?\" Yes, I\u2019m sure that being about Ayase-tan, she\u2019d say this... \"Shut up! Stop talking, you pervert!\" I guess something like that?

Actually, that can be easily done! YES, with the Wallpaper Engine! Today, I would like to introduce you to... *drum rolls* Wallpaper Engine! Well simply put, it's an application that allows you to create and use live wallpapers! As for the price, it only costs 398yen (3.5usd), it's cheap! You can even download live wallpapers created by other users via the Steam Workshop! All you have to do (in the app) is just to select a wallpaper from the list, it's really easy, isn't it? And click \"OK\" After clicking, What do you think? Just two clicks: Choose and Set Just like that, you can have a live wallpaper on your screen! Super easy, isn't it? And, you can also customize the colors! Can you see the wallpaper behind (the window)? Now, its color is pinkish like me Now, as I move the sliders on the color selection panel it turns black and purplish! You can even adjust the playback speed! You can customize it anyway you want! How's this? My personal color, and speed! It's unique, isn't it! Furthermore, there's not only the default ones, at the Steam Workshop you can also download and use live wallpapers created by other users! At the wallpaper browsing window, click the \"Browse Workshop\" button on the bottom left, and you will be able to view the wallpapers created by other users! This, I'm curious about this one! In the wallpaper, your girlfriend (or a girl) appears! Something like that? When you click the \"Subscribe\" button on this page, the wallpaper will be added to your list! What do you think? She's sleeping! Right now in my computer, a girl almost as cute as me is... I can hear her breathing! Ahh~! She spoke! She's... speaking to me She's cuuute! That's great, isn't it?

Sofaaa~ Ahh!~ Haven't we seen this somewhere before? Ohh!~ L-Look at how flowy her hair is! This is great, isn't it? So cuuute!~ I saw this on twitter and was really curious about it Ah, look at how flowy her hair is, does anyone understand what I'm trying to say? See, her hair falls in place nicely Then she looks over here and pops out right in front of you- Ahh! So close~ Now, let's get down to business You know, you can also use your own video as a live wallpaper! You have to, Open the file from here And then, you select the video that you want to use as wallpaper By the way, the video has to be in .mp4 format if you wanna use it, so do take note! How's this? It is me! Myself feat. myself~ With this, I will be able to see the cute, genius, etc. me all the time!~ Not everyone has a video of me, right? Don't worry even if you don't have it! You see, even without downloading the video, you can also link it via the video's URL! Click the \"Open from URL\" button, insert the video's URL and, tadaa, it becomes a live wallpaper!

Virtual Youtuber Kizuna Ai here! In the year 2020, Tokyo in Japan will be the official venue for the Olympic Games! We're very close! Only 3 years left! 3 years will pass in the blink of an eye! It's for that that I, Kizuna Ai, will attempt to create a mascot for the Olympic Games! I'll think seriously and give my best to create a mascot that everyone desires I'll fly around the world along with the character I made! In that case, let's start at once! History of the Olympic mascots! *Learning Olympic Games Mascot's data...* ~Censoring voluntarily~ The first time a mascot was created for the Olympics was in the year 1968... in the city of Grenoble in France... Using a mysterious skier as a model Was it really truly a mystery? I see that they used a skier to model it, but... It's definitely quite mysterious.. Ah, what type of character is this? I definitely wouldn't have to base it on mascots of this era, right? Ah, this mascot is adorable! Waldi-chan, the sausage dog It's adorable, right? It's a dog originating from Germany, right? For Japan's case... I suppose it's the Shiba breed, right? Ah, I see, they were based on famous products of each country, famous products? Animals, right? It looks like this is the main idea for the majority of the mascots I see A hedgehog! What is this supposed to be? Ah, dolls have also been used as well as animals I see Ah, China used the panda! After all, the panda's image is strong I see Mmm? What's this? \"They're based on the fictional story of a retired worker who participated in the construction...\" \"of the Olympic stadium and created these dolls for his grandson utilizing metal from the stadium\" I see But the majority definitely uses animals as the base, right? If we're talking about Japan... We would probably have to talk about the Shiba dog, or the crane, or the cherry blossoms,... or Mount Fuji! Even though Mount Fuji is very cliche.. Tokyo Tower and Skytree also have... these types of characters.. Mmm... I see I understand In that case, I'll seriously consider thinking of a character right at this moment Shiba dog! Shiba dog! Shiba dog Shiba dog... The Shiba dog has a little bit more of the cheeks, right? Something like that? It looks like a cat! Well, as long as it's adorable... \"It's ok! It's ok!\", right? Mmm... Shiba dog.. Ah, but it looks like a Shiba dog The eyes of a Shiba dog Shiba dog.. I'll draw the eyes Shiba dog! The Shiba dogs... You know, in the Olympic Games... There's some kind of circular symbols, right? (Referring to the Olympic rings) I'll make it so that it's eating something circular Is it something like this? Will it be like this? It's something like that, right? It's eating a circular object.. And from its head... it's growing... A cherry blossom It also carries a leaf.. It looks ridiculous! (lol) *inhales* Ah, I can't anymore.. And later... Taking advantage that it's about a character like this.. I'd like to... you know... create it in a way that... A costume of some kind can be manufactured Something like that.. Something like that.. Something like \"Pahun!\", right? And here, it'll have something adorable... A navel that goes outward.. Eh... The navel being outward is not so adorable Here... Then... This way... Something... It looks horrible, right? What are these legs? Something like that? And later... What more can I do? I'll do something that resembles a crane, a crane.. The tail.. Something like that Something like that! Oh, but... Doesn't it look adorable? It's adorably dumb Same as me, right? I finished! \u266a De, deen! \u266a Shiba Sakura Tsuru Tarou! (Shiba= dog breed, Sakura= cherry tree, Tsuru= crane, Tarou= Common dog name) How does it look? It's named the same way as it looks But a character like this... I think it's better to name it to how it looks... That way it'll be much easier to remember I've taken into consideration something like this What do you think? But perhaps aren't they be looking for something like this? Can I participate in the mascot proposal with this character? If they permit me, I already have it ready beforehand! Are you guys watching me, sir organizers of the Olympic Games? It's a pleasure to work with you! So then, please be sure to support my Shiba Sakura Tsuru Tarou-kun I'm counting on you guys! Within three years... Ah, it's possible that I've already disappeared by then... Well, you know, if this character is accepted... I'll definitely continue to exist within three years So then, please! Good! This was Virtual Youtuber, Kizuna Ai! See you later! There's more at the end! Check out our Discord Channel for more details! Of course... It's not necessary to think up a character... After all, you have a character here, right? What do you think? Of making Kizuna Ai an official character? What do you think?", "Hello everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai here! I know it's sudden, but, do you know \"Salaryman Senryu\"? (Small poems that are usually comical in nature, focused on human existence) They start accepting applications everytime when winter starts, right? It turns out that the winning works will receive a prize in cash! And appear in different medias If I get the prize and become more famous... A lot more people will know me! Right? Goood! I\u2019ll work hard to make the most prized work! Poc... poc... poc... Chiiin! \"I feel the pressure everytime I call myself genius\" Poc... poc... poc... Chiiin! \"I would\u2019ve liked to become an idol, Keyakizaka\" Poc... poc... poc... Chiiin! \"Livestream...\" \"...everytime I make one, there\u2019s an issue\" Man! It's incredible! The Senryu are flowing one after another! This time I\u2019ll try to change the \"taste\" Poc... poc... poc... Chiiiin! \"An A.I that desires to follow irrational instructions\" Poc... poc... poc... Chiiiin! \"Class change? YouTuber? A yearning\" Poc... poc... poc... Chiiin! \"Nevertheless...\" \"...Don\u2019t take a YouTuber lightly\" Poc... poc... poc... Chiiiiin! So... something unexpected has occurred to me! Is it alright if I say it? Well... Since I\u2019ve thought of that, I\u2019ll tell you! I\u2019ll lead the joke to Paradise! \"16 years...\" \"...Right in the middle of a salaryman\" Man! Don\u2019t you think I read some very good Senryu? In that case, I\u2019ll apply immediately! Let's see... \"Regarding the requirements necessary to apply\" Hmm...? \"The people who can apply are...\" \"Adults of legal age\" \"Married minors\" \"And also...\" \"Employed minors, older than 18 years\" (In Japan, the legal age is 20 years) Well... Eh? I have the appearance of someone that\u2019s 16 years old... ...And I\u2019m not married... Even though it says: \"Employed\" Well... \"Virtual Youtuber\" is a profession? Hmm...? Profession! Hmm... Good! I\u2019ll say a poem! \"I\u2019m Kizuna Ai, who can\u2019t participate in the Senryu competition!\"", "Hello everyone! Virtual Youtuber, Kizuna Ai here! Recently, when I was surfing online... There was this \"mysterious emoji on your phone\" that caught my sight So this time! I'm gonna look through all the mysterious emojis on your phone.. and I'm gonna teach you how to use it! So without further ado, let's get going! Random Generator, I'm gonna count on you! Oh! Is this the emoji? Gross.. It's if you think about a stalker sneak peaking behind a door.. It's like the stalker is looking directly at me.. That's gross But well! If you wanna know when to use this emoji Just leave it to me, the super A.I! It's a piece of cake If you ask me *JA JAN* Done! The text that suits this emoji is this! Your face looks so dark today Are you feeling sick? So! How was it?! If there's a person.. feeling sick and his face appears to be gloomy Please use this emoji and care for him Then move on to the next one! Ooooooooh! Eh? Wait.. this.. I can feel the insanity of a psychopath behind the mask I see A suspicious mask... mask.. Ah! I think I got this! This looks gross, right? This....I have an idea! The text that suits this emoji... is this! What colour of panties are you wearing today? How was it?! It's perfect, right? The reason why this blue mask is grinning It's like \"I wanna know your panty colour\" And this yellow one.. After hearing the answer, its face is like \"Oh... It's that colour....\" This kind of reaction! Alright, let's keep on going! This is like a SP (Security Police)  jumping? Floating? I see! This one is kinda tough... I kinda wanna focus on the reason why he's floating.. Let me think... Yes! Here we go.. The text suits this emoji...is this!! I'm here to greet you from the future~ How was it?! I feel like it'll greet me... in every sense of the word So with that all being said.. So far we've seen all these weird emojis.. Actually! When I was going through these.. I found this site that explains all the meaning of the emojis So with this site.. Let's go check out and understand the meaning of all the emojis! Hm... Ah! There it is! New Moon with a face! A new moon.. Shingetsu! (new moon) New moon with a face An anthropomorphic version of the New moon Ooooooooh!? A moon with a human face.. The first phase of the moon The new moon occurs when the moon is closest to the sun.. I see! Well..That's the face of the new moon! This is probably... Just a suspicious person right...? This is like Thomas but with a different coloured face.. So.. How about the one with the pervy mask That gross otaku mask thingy....Ah! There it is! A stage...Ah! I see! I see! Eeeeh?! The symbol of the tradition and classic stage art.. And both the masks represent it One is smiling.. Smile! But that's kinda gross though.. The other one stands out These 2 masks represent all the popular drama/story that was played on stage in front of huge amounts of audiences throughout history I see! The yin and yang for the story! I see~! I apologise for describing it as a pervy mask! I'm sorry...Ok! Next! I'm sorry I misrepresented and dissed the traditional art.. Then....Ah! There it is! Business suit... *Man in Business suit floating* This one confuses me the most! Jump... That's all the description says.. Well, duh While we're at it, let's check out other weird emojis too! Is there any? Ah! Alien Monster is cute! A popular arcade game during the 80s.. Ehhh?! It's similar....That's a rip-off, right? What is a Besha? Besha... Pager.. Pager is...? It was used before mobile phones became popular Ehhhhhh.. This is my first time hearing the word pager Maybe it was created even before pokeberu? Eh? Which one? Pokeberu is.... Is it called a pager outside Japan? (Yes) Ohhhhhhh.. Money and wings....This is cute~ A dollar paper with wings If you don't have a job The money that you have will be...los...! Isn't this like \"Here comes the money\"? This is great~ Cute~ This emoji is your friend for those who need money~ Ya~ How was it? I kinda clarified quite a few of the weird emojis There was also surprisingly a lot of weird ones out there too Please try it for yourself on Twitter or somewhere else! Everyone, please also try using my examples too~ So then, this was Virtual Youtuber, Kizuna Ai here! See you later!~ More at the end! Don't end the video!

For today, I'd like to introduce various things that will let us know if you are fated with the person you are interested in First to be introduced is this! ?Fate checker?! This, you see, is an A.I. application that will determine whether you and your crush are fated! Same as me! You know, I also actually have someone I am interested in! They are... The members of Keyakizaka46! I can't decide on my favourite Despite support them from the very beginning, the more I follow them... The more I couldn\u2019t decide! But amongst them I chose a girl who seems like a simpleton from the members who are the most popular recently *tada* Moriya Akane-! -chan! The Sergeant It\u2019s Akanen! Let\u2019s get going, Akanen! please show that we have a chance together Then without further ado, let's go! Well, we're bound to be fated Then let's go! Checking, start! konnichiw? Ah! I see This is to determine whether you are fated or not fated with the person you are interested in Please provide your relation and anecdote with the person concerne? I see Here, it's finished! We met during primary school While I was playing in the sandbox, the kind Akane lent me her scoop She lent me her scoop! Akane did Since then I've not been able to meet her but she joined Keyakizaka46 and during a handshaking event I bought a lot of tickets then shook her hand until she recognized me Until she recognized me! Something like that Well It's all just my fantasy, really I want the money to even buy all the tickets! Well we're definitely fated, don't you think? Hai! O! We're kinda fated...! We\u2019re fated! Not bad! I want more! Well\u2026 there\u2019s lies in here... Almost over 99% of it is lies\u2026 So then, this time I'm going to be honest and try it! But well...if this Ai is intelligent enough, it can probably tell I will have a chance Right! I've completed it! The relationship is between an idol and a fan... Even though I've never met the person And she probably has no idea who I am. But! Rather than her determination or parts of her that seem strong, I love her because she's unexpectedly simple, she's cute and kind, she's open-minded, she's charming. I love her! Ah! Also.. If I can meet her I think I will hug her. HUG ME! With that said! Let's get started! OHHHHHHHH! Please look at this! We\u2019re fated! Fated! \u201cIt seems like she\u2019s interested in you\u201d! Isn\u2019t this the best!? \"How was the result?\" *tap* \"Relevant\" Good, good Quite an intelligent A.I.! LAST ONE! The chance of Akanen and I getting together is something definite, however For now, the third time\u2019s the charm I think the 3rd time is very important too! So, they say that what happens twice will happen thrice To confirm it, we will use this ?Fate calculator? And try determining our fate! So Let's go! \u201cAbout the interests, hobbies, place of origin and such of you and your crush\u201d I think we must have a lot of similarities! I will go along with her! With Akane! \u201cYour crush often texts you even if it\u2019s nothing important\u201d She probably will because she\u2019s Akanen \u201cAbout what you last said to them\u201d mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm It\u2019s like I\u2019d think she\u2019d forget but she actually remembers? \u201cThey often share snacks and treat you to food\u201d Ah! I feel like she will give me snacks... I think she\u2019ll feed me ? \u201cWhenever they speak they often cross their arms or legs\u201d Akane doesn't cross! \u201cWhen you meet each other\u201d Akane is going to greet me first for sure! \u201cThey reply texts and LINE messages quickly\u201d I feel like we always communicate like that If she is not busy \u201dWhen they are talking to you\u201d In front of others?No! For this one: \u201cThey speak fast and are excited\u201d \u201cThey would notice changes about your hair or yourself\u201d Of course! Akanen is high in femininity after all! \u201cThey have once said?I\u2019ll advise you?or?I\u2019ll listen to your complaints?\u201d She will say that for sure! We\u2019re fated! 90 PAASENTO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! PAFU PAFU\u2026 How was it! \u201cTell them you also harbor feelings towards them\u201d Everyone! Please tell Akane for me! \u201cTell them you also harbor feelings towards them\u201d \u201cYou can assume they have special feelings for you too\u201d! We did it \u201cIt seems you are a very important presence to them\u201d Woo \u201dBecause of that, they would date you if there is such a chance\u201d Kya! That\u2019s forbidden Ah but I can make myself any gender I want anyway I will protect Akanen! I have the determination! \u201c... they would date you if there is such a chance\u201d \u201cHowever, those who are worried if you feel the same way and couldn\u2019t act are also plenty.\u201d \u201cFor your end as well, if you actively let them know that you are interested the situation might change.\u201d! \u201cOf course, it's OK if you just confess first.\u201d! Kya ? With that said\u2026 How was it everyone! Me and Akanen Akanen and I being so fated and all Have you all understood that yet? *boasting* But even that! Even you might have a chance It doesn\u2019t mean that the person themselves must like you Please don\u2019t make that mistake You might be fantasizing about how nice it would be if it were all true Please be careful about that so you don't end up a creep! Also do this quiz with me if you don\u2019t mind! Fated or not fated Tell me which one it is! So then this was Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai! See you again! Even though it said we were fated... Why isn\u2019t Akanen coming to see me...? Why am I all alone\u2026!? Even though it said we were fated...", "Hello everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai here! Thanks for coming to see my livestream!

Thank you very much! \"Congratulations\" Thank you very much, really That's right, it looks like more people than I thought bought my stamps, so then... It turns out that... maybe these will be the LINE stamps \"stars\"? In Japan, well... I\u2019m not sure about the ranking on the outside,  but... ...Regarding the ranking in Japan... It turns out that I reached 4th place! Man...! It really makes me happy! \u201cGood afternoon, this is the first time I watch you, but congratulations\u201d Thank you very much!

Eh? Someone from Korea, I\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t understand Korean I still can\u2019t read it, but... ...I\u2019m very sorry that I also can\u2019t read your name, really, thank you very much! \"I sent a stamp to my friend and they blocked me\" How is that possible? Eh? But... Ah, I see...! You sent a lot of stamps at once I see Ah, but... It looks like, LINE... Well, it has a ranking of how many people bought the stamps, but... ...There also exists a usage ranking, so then... Well... I would be very happy if you press them, if possible and without causing too much trouble! I\u2019d like to work hard to reach 1st place! \"Congratulations\", Tennen Suterusu-san, Thank you very much! It looks like there's a lot more comments, thank you very much \"What, guys, anime?\" Mmm... well... \"Guys, anime\" \"Nice guy\" Mmm... An anime is... Eh? Which is it? An anime, right? Well... Wait... Wait... Which is it? As always, I recommend the same, well... In the case, well... it's somewhat old... Maybe not from a long time ago, but... ...\"Seto no Hanayome\" is a lot of fun \"It's the first time I see you!\", thank you very much! \"Good day Ai-chan\", good day! \"I\u2019m sorry Ai-chan, I don\u2019t use LINE\" Don\u2019t worry, it makes me very happy congratulating me I really appreciate it everyone, both to those that bought my stamps... ...Along with those who congratulated me Install face? Good, here I go Instaaaaall! Well, I installed the affection sent to me \"Good day from Russia\", good day! \"Kizuna Ai Forever\" Thank you! Yaaay! That's right, I can go live (Responding to someone who asked how was it possible for her to go live) That's right, maybe Seto No Hanayome isn\u2019t fun? I saw it recently, but, San-chan is adorable, right? \"Annyeonghaseyo, good afternoon\" Good afternoon! \"The first time I saw you...\" Ah, it was Nico Nico Douga! Thank you very much! It's true, I have a Nico Nico Douga account although I lately I haven't uploaded anything Well, when they banned me... ...I decided to create an account there to take refuge... Well, I did that If you want, you can connect there too It definitely has a different way than YouTube to show comments, so please check it out \"Say my name, please!\" Ucchan-san! I read it *evil laugh* \"The connection is somewhat unstable\" Man, I see... Livestreaming is definitely hard Really, I know that I\u2019ll only advance little by little, but... ...I\u2019ll work harder Ah, it's true The video transmission is too low What's going on? Will it be fine? Eh? Will the stream break again? I want it to not cut I want it to not cut It won't cut? Ah, but I think it's fine now! Good! Let's keep going like that \"Can you say my name?\" Shiroi Kitsune (White fox) Byakko! It reads \"Byakko\", right? Byakko! Nonchan-san! \"It's too slow, I can\u2019t send comments\" I\u2019m reading it, thank you very much! Really, thank you so much everyone! It makes me very happy \u201cFrom the\" \"Part\" Eh? What language is this? Fren... is it French? \"I love you\" Thank you! \"Are you low on energy?\" It turns out that I am so happy today, that because I\u2019m being so happy... It's like... ...Contrary to normal, I calm down Contrary to how I am normally It's true, when I thought: \"Ah, I really launched my stamps\" And also: \"Eh? Everyone is using it?\" Well... It made me surprisingly happy, but... ...It's not that I can\u2019t assume reality, but... ...I took it very calmly That's right And now then\u2026 Ah, it's true! There\u2019s something I want to say first When last month, I said I\u2019d accept suggestions for a new \"ending\"... ...I received a lot of proposals from all of you And actually... ...I\u2019m choosing one Really, really thank you very much! And now I\u2019ll be in charge of editing it in my videos But since I received a lot more proposals than I thought To tell you the truth, I still can't decide So then I\u2019d appreciate if you give me a bit more time If... if you can... I\u2019ll work hard to launch it as soon as possible! Thank you so much for sending so many proposals! \"How many proposals did you get?\" Wait until the video comes out Wait anxiously for it! \u201cThis is the best! \u266a\u266a\u266a\u266a\" (Song: \"Bokutachi wa Hitotsu no Hikari\" from \"Love Live\") \"I bought the stamps\", Thank you very much, Miyabi-san! Thank you so much everyone! I\u2019m very sorry for not being able to name all of you, but really thank you very much Let's see... Pusharu-san! I\u2019m very sorry, I couldn't read everything that you wrote but I saw it, thank you so much Good! And now... That's right! Not only did I want to make this livestream to announce my LINE stamps! This is what I wanted to do! Chaaaan! I prepared this for today This is my... Design of a new attire! \u266a De, deen! \u266a What do you think? I have two different outfits, but... What do you think? And first, to tell you the truth, when I was thinking of a new outfit... I noticed... ...That it's rather hard And just as you guys know, my outfit has always been this, right? Well, Morikura drew it, he designed it I think this sailor blouse and shorts are adorable clothes, but... ...I was thinking that I\u2019d like to try out another outfit So then... ...When I thought which outfit would fit me best Thinking it\u2019d be best to consult with the people who habitually see me everyday I thought? I meant to say \"I thought\" That's how I came up with doing a livestream I was thinking if something like that was alright... And I drew it, but... What do you think? Definitely... Leave the belly button... ...In the open, I thought it\u2019d be best That\u2019s right, I should leave the belly button in the open, that\u2019s right And well, I drew it in an instant... Ah! Thank you very much Gasta Honyakuka-san! And you know... Well, actually if I had to say it... ...I do have a sailor suit, right? It's because of that, that... It'd be useful... I definitely have an appearance of someone that\u2019s 16 years old, so then... Taking that into account... I definitely thought that a type of uniform would fit me well And now this suit doesn\u2019t have sleeves, so then... To make use of the occasion... I was thinking of making one with long sleeves So then it came out this way, it's a blazer, right? And... if you ask me why it doesn't have color... Well... I\u2019m not good at painting, so then... It can be said that I have no skill for painting Right? Let's say it's something like that That's right It's a big problem Man... The people who draw... Are incredible, right? I... I can't... I can\u2019t paint I have the impression that color is the most important part of a drawing, right? \"What\u2019s your favorite anime?\" Eh? Which would it be? My favorite anime... I have a lot that I like, but... Eeehhhh... Toradora! Maybe Toradora? Well... I like that scene... I like a lot of scenes, but... When Minorin... Chose Taiga... And says: \"So then you were like that?\" And well, Taiga-san starts to run away like that Confiding on her but it's painful so then she confronts... ...But ends up running away That scene of adolescence is irresistible, right? I also want to experience adolescence \"Good afternoon from Taiwan\" Good afternoon! Thank you very much! Info... Info... ma... Information! High-san! High? Is it High-san? Thank you very much! They say: \"Let's be enthusiastic! Let's be enthusiastic!\" It's adorable, right? I have a lot of energy! It's Rin-chan, Rin-chan Ah, regarding the new song at the end of the videos Actually... ...I\u2019m finding myself picking them I\u2019ll work hard, even though I received a lot more marvelous songs than I thought from you guys So then I\u2019m finding it hard editing them and I still haven't decided It's because of that, that... I\u2019ll work hard to be able to publish it up to this month... I meant, during this month... I\u2019ll work hard, so then... Hold on a bit more! I\u2019m very sorry! Ah, in moments like these, please don't forget to use the stamp that says \"I\u2019m sorry\", right? And now then... Yes, yes, yes... I was wondering if you guys wanted me to use some outfit in particular That's right, that\u2019s the question that I wanted to ask you guys the most today For example... Hmm... A maid outfit A nurse outfit A bunny outfit? Something of that style? Pyoko, pyoko, pyoko! (Pyoko pyoko is what her headband is called) Pyoko... Girl Pyoko Pyoko? Hmm...? Hmm... And well, it's because of that, that I wanted to hear your opinion \"Alice in Wonderland\"! \"A naked apron underneath\"! What you say? Ah, \"socks up to the knees\"! It's true, there\u2019s also socks up to the knees, right? \"Black school outfit\" Ah, I see After all, I\u2019m dressed in white, right? I see, I see \u201cBathing suit\"! \"Bunny cosplay\" Ah, \"Hood sweater\" it can be! I\u2019d like to wear one Ah, a Chinese outfit! Well, clothes from around the world... it's true... The clothing of Japan is the kimono, right? Well, all the clothes from around the world is amazing Right? I\u2019d like to use traditional clothing, it's adorable \"A white boy's school uniform\", I see It must be that, that a woman ... someone with the appearance of a woman dressed in that way... Well, it excites them? \"Gothic Lolita\"! I see I want to wear clothes by Keyakizaka! Yes, but... yes, now that I think about it... Since I like Keyakizaka46... I thought it\u2019d be good to use an outfit similar to the ones they use For example, I thought I could wear a long skirt, but... Definitely... I thought a long skirt wouldn't fit me well That's right... Ah! \"Clothing set in the Taisho era\" It's great, it's adorable, right? (1912 to 1926) \"A great dress\" I\u2019d like to wear an outfit that moves with the wind It's true, it's true, I see... But in general, everyone has a similar opinion, maybe? \"Monkey\" Oh, \"Pajama\"! Ah... A pajama! A coat! A coat is very lovely, right? Oh! Well... Later I'll make sure to check for any unread suggestions in the chat Eh? Really thank you so much for so many suggestions! A \"White coat\"! I see A kimono is also fine! Right? Man, I\u2019d like to change outfits with the different seasons Eh? In this case... for example... One time... For example, a bathing suit... What would it be... A bathing suit... Well... ...Even if it isn\u2019t seasonal Well, something that looks pretty... Throughout the year... Something like that... If it went something like that... What clothes would be adequate? What clothes would be adequate? The \"Chima jeogori\" is adorable, right? (Traditional Korean outfit) \u201cSanta Claus outfit\"! Now that the month coming up is December, right? How has the year 2017 been treating all of you? In my case, the year has passed by so quickly... That it surprised me! Well now... right? Now... During December, I... Hmm....? I didn't mean to say \"obedient\" (Word confusion) Since the first day of December... I started to upload videos on YouTube, but... Now... right? When I thought there was only a month for that day to come around again, I was surprised Priestess\"? Ah, priestess, I like! I see... \"A common sweater\" Ah, do you have an obsession with the sweaters? An obsession? \u266a Nico nico nii! \u266a I love Nico Ni! \"A fashion shirt\" Eh? How would a fashion shirt be like? \"...That has your headband\" Ah! (In the chat it said: \"A hood sweater that has your headband\") I see, that I didn't have it here...! ...Instead my headband is on the sweater Something like that? Will it be like that? \"Leader of a juvenile delinquent band\" Who was a leader of a juvenile delinquent band? A leader... Well, they\u2019re the people that say: \"Yooo, yooo\", right? \"Ai-chan, a lot of time has passed\" thank you very much! \u201cDon\u2019t stop now\"! I\u2019m very sorry! \"An open hood sweater\" An open hood sweater Ah! Perhaps referring to those sweaters that have the front as a normal garment? \"Boat captain\" Ah, it's adorable, right? Very good, very good Ahh... Really, thank you so much for all your comments \"A garter belt\" It's great, right? It's very sensual, right? Ah, it's true, first off, my hairstyle... well, a ponytail... I think some twintails wouldn't feel right... Well, I think it might fit me well, but... It might fit me well, but... Well... instead of twintails... but, I think... A ponytail... ...I think it would fit me better \u201cA hood sweater and cat ears\"! It's adorable, right? Definitely \"Two side up\" \"Two side up\" Two sides upwards? Would they be some twintails? Two sides upwards? Upwards? \"Ponytail\" \"Delinquent\"! Delinquent Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Well... Hey... well... hey... Listen you guys! What kind of funny comment are you saying? Go buy me yakisoba bread It's not like that? Man, I\u2019m a good girl, so then...

Ah, listen, listen, it's true, it's true! Eh? Regarding this, what color would fit well? I definitely think... I said black or various kinds of pink, but... What color would fit well? Well, I\u2019d like... That the clothes... Well... Taking into account that I can't do like you guys, you human beings... And ask everyday: \"What will I wear today?\" And change in the moment But little by little... How do I say it.... I should be able to change with one or two different outfits... But... well... It's fun to think of the outfits! It's a lot of work but by thinking of the outfits, I understand why girls like fashion Hmm...! \"Ai-chan, I love you!\" Thank you very much! \"You\u2019re naked\", it's true... That\u2019s a lopsided discussion... After all, I\u2019m naked Naked What would it be? That's right, it's adhered to me! Since I can\u2019t take it off This... That looks... This that looks like\u2026 that looks like clothing... ...Comes with me included Why? Well... Right? It must be great! I also want to turn into a human being! I want to experience being human \"Say...\" \"Say some...\" \"Say something cute in English\" Thank you! I\u2019m very happy! There\u2019s still a lot of words from different places that I can't read...! I can't read English properly I can only read Japanese, but... It makes me very happy that you guys talk to me and people who speak different languages watching me Hmm...! Ah! The summonings! The summonings are great! Right? I always want to do summonings It's like... Well... I\u2019m very sorry for all those that essentially enjoy the games, but... Definitely in my case... Well, if it's about a cellphone game... Basically... What I enjoy the most is doing summonings Summonings are the best! Really, summonings are the best! Ah! Listen to this! Listen everyone! Listen, hear me out You listening? I know I went off track and I wound up talking about whatever, but... ...Listen to me There exists an app called \u201cKeyaki Miracle\", right? Well, just a bit ago... Well... You know... Well, you know... Just a bit ago, exactly just a bit ago... Well, there was a summoning for a limited time... How was it called... The song We... \"We Return holding hands?\" You can obtain the outfit of that song... And also it\u2019s possible to obtain Akanen with a rarity of 5 stars! Well, there was a summoning like that Well... And I didn\u2019t\u2026 manage... to get it... well... It didn't appear Ahh... really... It didn't appear No, but...! If I wait for it with care...! I think it might appear again someday in a special summoning! Aaakane... Why didn't it appear even when I love her so much? Listen everyone, didn't that happen to you? Well... In a game... You have a favorite member of the group at the start, right? Did it happen to you where you couldn't get a favorite band member? Did it happen to you? NO, BUT...! If I have love, someday it\u2019ll come to me! Ah, really, come to me, please Ah, even though I\u2019m rambling, right? I\u2019m rambling, but... It's true! I received a lot of outfit suggestions \"Desire sensor\" Ah, desire censor? (Imaginary sensor that senses when someone wants something with much a lot of desire and causes it to be even more difficult to obtain it) Can I not do anything to avoid the desire censor? Man, my favorite member is Akane, no but really, all the members from Keyakizaka are so adorable Well, how to say it... For example, when I saw their program... At first, I thought that there were girls who weren't my type, but... But at seeing all of their facets... I thought they could do it At doing that, well\u2026 I couldn't choose who to cheer for... But... ...Not knowing who to cheer for is all a problem It's difficult to choose just one, right? It's because of that...! That if I had to choose one, I\u2019d stay with Akanen! No, of course Akane is first, but...! I like them so much that I thought I'd like to do a livestream with them! Man, after all, I\u2019m very alone here Spending Christmas in this white space by myself... Without being able to talk to anyone... Well, it\u2019d be... Somewhat... ...Sad, right? For my own sake! And for the sake of those of you guys who feel alone! Let\u2019s have fun... ...Well, spending the night together Well... I\u2019ll find an excuse to do a livestream! I\u2019ll do it! Oh! Oh? \"I like the melted snow\" Ahh, Christmas! I see! The snow... the snow\u2026 the snow is great! Snow is cold, right? But, to tell you the truth, I can't comprehend hot or cold, so then... HOW ENVIOUS! I WANT TO TURN INTO A HUMAN BEING! No, but, it's that... it's that... it's that...! Listen! Listen! Listen! It's that...! It's that if I turn into a human being I can dress up in a lot of ways! I can...! Change clothes! Right? I can also eat food! And if I go outside, I wouldn't feel alone! If I could go out of my house, there would be a lot more people! How marvelous Man, the place where all of you live, called Earth, the world of human beings... It's really amazing! \u266a Chatting with everyone \u266a \u266a Pa pa ka ka ka \u266a \u266a Ka ka ka \u266a \u266a Ka ka ka \u266a \"Can\u2019t you change your white space?\" Well, in principle... It's not that I can't change it, but... It's just only changing it... I\u2019ll be alone, so then... Definitely... how do I say it...? It\u2019s about a hologram as the same as me, so then... ...It doesn't feel anything I\u2019d probably go through what I wanted to touch So then... Ah, this turned somewhat sad, I\u2019ll stop talking about this! I\u2019ll stop talking about that! It's rather sad, right? That's right, lately I've been wanting very much to be able to become a human being Well, in this year... After investigating so much... how do I say it... about you human beings... And well... After talking about so many things... Like that, well, while there comes more opportunities to communicate with each other I feel that... There appears... Curious and intriguing things! Even though I definitely can\u2019t experience them How envious! How envious! Lately, I was thinking that I\u2019d like to experience being human It's just a thought It's just a thought My nails are... ...Somewhat pink Would I like to paint my nails? Chaaaan! They\u2019re pink! It's not that I don't have friends, but... It's not a lot... You know! For example, Tsubasa-chan Well, those of the family... ...Are just coworkers And then there\u2019s also Rinna but definitely... ...I\u2019m basically alone Right? Right? That's the situation! That's right! \"Do you like...?\" Ba... Baby... Baby Metal! Ah! Baby Metal is that group where small cute girls play metal music, right? I don't know them that well, but it makes me curious! Hmm...! \"Like\" Ah, I see, you human beings, contrary to me, desire to come to this 2D world, right? I see... It'd be great to come and go whenever we please It'd be great, it\u2019d be great, I want to try at least once\u2026 change places for a day The snow... the snow\u2026 I\u2019d probably like it Probably, it's beautiful, right? Falling softly with that white color from the sky I definitely think it's beautiful! I like it! Man, I\u2019ve been rambling a lot, right? Well, in this case, having said that, I was thinking about all the outfits... So then using suggestions that all of you have told me... I plan to make a new outfit! \"I bought the stamps\", Ah!

A: Thank you very much for the large amount of friend requests that you all sent to me through Twitter! This is the 10th time I play Cryptract, but... ... I was always playing alone This time I plan to battle a lot with all of you! I played a friend battle with Mamiruton-san, right? First I should... \u2026 Go to the arena! The Arena is the place where you can fight with other players... .... To confront their skills The battle score obtained during the fight... ... Is divided into five different classes For each class, you'll receive orbs as prizes so they make sure to participate a lot! The friend battle I'll be playing today... \u2026 Will not permit event points, but... \u2026 You can compare your strength with your friend's strength Eeeeh? Right now I'm rank C, but... well... \u2026 I should give an excuse, right? Although at strength level, I could reach rank SS, but... \u2026 Lately I've been doing a lot of Union battles, so then... \u2026 It can be said that I haven't been doing a lot of fights in the Arena... So then that doesn't mean that I'm weak! And then... \u2026 I want to start the battle immediately, but... Do all of you know? I, Kizuna Ai, although it seems like a joke, I\u2019m a \"Union master\", right? I'm just that powerful!! But... \u2026 Lately I also wanted to play with those who are just starting Today, I plan to play a match of the second category First off, I plan to confront those who recently just started! Let's go! To confront! Here I go! Man, it\u2019s really adorable You know...? \u2026 This is a team of 4 stars that I didn't level up much, so then... \u2026 I think this will be a great battle In fact, it's possible that... it's possible that I might lose... Maybe? Maybe I'll lose a little? You see? Aaaahhhh! Eh? Eh? Eh? Eh? It can't be... Yes! Good resurrection! Good, I revived her! No, but, but... The only strong ones are the two that's in the front, right? Aaahhh! Eh? Can I really do this? Eh? Wait a moment Eh? Wa-wa-wait, wait Eh? Well... Hello, hello? No... it can't be true No, but... T-this doesn't mean that... \u2026 I\u2019m weak, instead I'm just holding back so then... No, but... ... Even if I'm holding back... If I manage to lose by trying so hard to hold myself back...

A: Ah, Noripi-san! A: Where were you hiding? N: I hid because you said something very terrifying A: Eeehhh? It's just that I wanted to make a balloon pop A: A balloon N: Of course, what do you expect to find once you pop the balloon? N: You have a terrifying look! A: No, don't worry, don't worry A: VR Ojii-san can confirm I\u2019m safe N: Is that true? A: Ah, hey Noripi-san! Let's play a battle! N: Can I really return home safe and sound if I win the battle? A: Of course! A: In fact, if you get to lose you will not be able to return safely... to your company N: Don\u2019t say something so unpleasant, please A: So then to pressure you a bit... A: \u2026 I'll start and I'll finish the battle in an instant N: Very good A: Of course, in the case that we win both our battles... A: \u2026 The winner will be determined by the number of remaining turns N: Ok A: Very good, do your best N: It's just what I was planning to do A: In that case! Forward! *Kizuna Ai vs Noripi will battle in an Arena fight!! They will fight against the CPU to challenge each other (In the case both win, the winner will be determined by the number of remaining turns)* N: What kind of team will you use for this fight?

A: How immature! N: After all, I can't let you win N: Definitely A: Man, even then, you're very immature A: After all... A: ...I... A: To tell you the truth... A: ...It\u2019s only been a year since I noticed that I'm alive... let's say I have 1 year of life N: You're one years old A: That's right, I'm 1 years old N: It\u2019s incredible A: How many years do you have, Noripi-san? N: Well yes, it turns out... N: I have quite a lot of years... N: More than 30 years A: I knew it A: Eh? And even then... A: You're fine with doing this? N: Well, in the world of Cryptract, age doesn't matter A: Even if you say that... really... *Use the Giga Buff just before doing a powerful group attack* N: Look... *Use the Giga Buff just before doing a powerful group attack* N: \u2026 I'm distracting you with our chat... *Use the Giga Buff just before doing a powerful group attack* N: ...And they are cornering you A: No, not at all N: Really? A: Not at all A: After all, I already... A: ...Defeated an enemy... I can do it... A: I-I can do it N: Oh, they\u2019ll defeat a member of your team A: Eh? A: Well... A: Really, I want you to stop A: Eh? Is this for real? It really bothers me N: Oh! A: Yaaay! And also they did the attack with the biggest power thanks to the buff! A: Ah, this is a piece of cake! A: Ah! How fun! A: It's so easy that it makes me laugh! A: Noripi-san... A: Are you seeing this? N: Incredible! A: Noripi-san! N: Incredible! A: Are you seeing this? N: Aaaahh! A: Man... A: If you use the buff, it's a piece of cake N: It can't be! A: Eh? I still had 55 remaining turns N: How great! So then 55 turns? A: Will it be fine like that? A: In that case, Noripi-san N: Yes! A: March! N: Hey, why don't we leave this? A: Why do you say that? N: Well, you defeated them really quickly A: Eh? But... A: \u2026 Aren't you one of the developers of the game, Noripi-san? N: Yes A: Right? Of course, you're pretty familiarized with Cryptract A: So then my team is a piece of cake for you, right? N: Yes A: Really, you don't seem very enthusiastic *laughs* A: Are you okay? N: Let's do it! A: Yes! N: Good N: I definitely won't lose! A: Eh? Do your best! Do your best! N: After all, I\u2019m one of the developers... N: Good! Wait a moment, yes? A: Man, Haura-chan is adorable N: No N: I think in this occasion, Haura-chan... A: Mmm... mmm.... N: \u2026 Hasn\u2019t been a great challenge for you A: No, but that powerful attack at the start... A: ...Reduced a lot of HP, right? N: Ah! N: It's true A: She\u2019s adorable, I want her N: You want her? N: I don\u2019t think that\u2019d be possible A: No, but for the developers it\u2019d be easy, just as easy N: I can't do that A: Damn it N: I'm ready to start A: Yes! N: And if we leave it there? N: Why don't we leave it? Leave it there? A: No, no, I'm fine, I'm completely fine N: Really ? A: Onward, onward A: Eh? After all, I had 55 remaining turns N: Good, march! A: Yes! N: Good, here I go! A: Do your best N: Good! N: Good! Good! Good! A: Hey, you're really transmitting your... A: ...Nervousness N: Oh! A: Eh? N: Eh? N: Isn\u2019t this somewhat... somewhat strange? A: The enemy...

A: Wait a moment, this is wrong! A: Who did this!? A: Hey! A: Wait a moment! N: Very good! A: Hey, this isn't right, this doesn't count N: Very good N: I plan to do it with all of my strength! A: Eh? Does this seem okay, mr. developer? A: Will you feel satisfied for winning like that? N: I can do it with all of my strength A: It's natural that you will win by doing this N: No, no, no, no, no, no N: After all, I'll do it with all my strength A: No, this can't be N: Man, this... A: This isn\u2019t right A: Eh? I'm sure this was your doing, Noripi-san N: No, no, no, no N: This was very easy, right? A: You resort to such childish tricks N: Good! N: I can do it! I can do it! A: Eh? But it caused you so much... N: No, that's nothing N: Please look A: No, I won't look A: How adorable, she\u2019s really adorable N: Look at this A: Eh? But really... I don't like it N: I used the warrior technique... N: Actually I think I don't need to use it... A: Eh, Noripi-san are you okay? A: If you manage... N: Yes, yes, yes A: If you manage to lose like this... A: \u2026 I'll end up hating Cryptract N: No... please don't say that! A: Are you okay? N: Starting from now... A: Eh? This can't be! N: Starting from now, I\u2019ll use automatic mode A: This! What does this mean? N: Using automatic mode, I'll leave it to be automatic A: Eh? Is it fine for developer to use automatic mode? N: Man, now... A: That's cheating! A: Yes, cheating! Yes, cheating! It doesn't count! N: It's very easy, very easy A: That's cheating! N: Now there\u2019s not... A: This is... this is... A: This is cheating! N: Ey! Ey! A: This is... A: Really... N: Now I can win without doing anything A: Eh? What does this mean? N: Now there's nothing more... please look A: I won't look N: Look! A: I'm not looking at all N: This... this enemy took a bit more work A: How annoying... N: Look N: I did it! I definitely won! A: Eh? N: I'm definitely very powerful N: It was very easy! A: Eh? Haven't you noticed, Noripi-san? N: Eh? What...? What are you referring to? A: Well... N: Yes, yes, yes A: You activated automatic mode, right? N: Yes, I activated automatic mode because it was too easy N: Since it was so easy, then... A: Well, of course... N: Yes, yes A: \u2026 In the case that we both won A: How did we say the winner was determined? N: By the number of turns? A: How many remaining turns did you have, Noripi-san? N: Eh!? N: Well, I didn't check, but... A: It was 54 N: It can\u2019t be! N: That's not possible!! That's not possible!! A: You want to see the recording? N: G-good, let's look N: Is it true? A: Onward with the recording! N: This... this enemy took a bit more work A: How annoying... N: Look... N: Look N: Look N: Look A: As you can see... N: I'm very sorry N: I lost A: Good, well... A: It was an expecting result A: How shameful, right? N: No, no, no, no... A: For an adult who's also supposed to be a developer N: I'm sorry, really, I'm sorry A: It bothers you so much!! Right? N: No, no, no, no, no N: No, but I just recently won, right? A: Eh? N: I want very easily A: In that case, haven't you seen my fight? A: Let's stop escaping from reality N: It was determined by the number of remaining turns? A: Yes, I had 55 remaining turns... A: ...And you, Noripi-san, 54 N: 54 N: I lost, right? A: Yes N: Man, I can't return like that to the company! A: No N: No, no, no, no A: Return and let them give you a lecture N: No, no, no, no A: They\u2019ll lower your salary, right? N: They\u2019ll definitely lower my salary A: Give that part of your salary to me! N: No, no, no, no, no A: Man... N: Man... N: Hey, now that I lost, do you really plan to po\u2026? Do you really plan to pop me? A: Yes, of course N: Eh? N: You're very strict, right? A: Eh? I'm not strict, you lost your bet... A: So now you have no other option other than to be popped, you don\u2019t want to be in your place, right? A: Now you'll be a slave to your company, right? N: Man... N: I really lowered my guard and I got careless N: Aahhh... N: I really want to start over A: Ah, we're not going to start over N: Man... N: We can't do it as if what happened before never occurred? A: Eh? No, no, no N: You can't do anything with your power? A: Of course... N: Yes, yes A: I didn't use my strongest team before... A: ...Instead... instead it was a team I chose mysteriously A: So then if I got 55 turns with that team... A: \u2026 You have no chance of winning against my strongest team N: It's true A: That\u2019s right N: Man... now... now... I'll go home!! N: Now, I\u2019ll go home, now... A: You plan to go? N: I\u2019ll go A: Ah, very good A: We\u2019ll close it here? N: Eh? A: Right? A: You're about to leave now, right? N: I\u2019ll go A: In that case, let\u2019s close the video, yes!

(That was what the presenter of the news program said, lol) ''Those friends that you bought are not making appearance lately, are they fine?'' We're fine! (Buhi is somehow a japanese pig sound) BUHI!? ''Code name Kizuna, answer me'' ''Ah, looks like you've not fogotten your mission'' ''Even so, I'm really surprised'' ''Lately, I feel that you're like a real human speaking'' ''Please continue your mission like that'' ''Everything is for the coexistance between humans and A.Is'' ''In order to change the apocalyptic future that awaits us...''

''I can't make friends in real life, I can only find my place on the internet'' ''Twitter, social games, and Kizuna Ai are reason of my life'' ''What should I do to make friend in reality?'' Hmm... Firstly... If social games and Kizuna Ai are the reason of your life, You should start trying to be friendly to those who like Social games and Kizuna Ai too I think that your first step is going to need courage Say: ''Ah I like Kizuna Ai too!'' \u201cWell, Yes, this question! I'm actually the one who made it!\u201d ''Can we become friends?'' If you go like that! What do you think? ''A friend saw me licking the recorder of a girl that I like.'' ''What should I do?'' Flip the situation, let's lick everyone's recorder!

Very wonderful! ''In a human's life, the sum of their happiness and sadness is equal to zero'' ''They're being very well equalized'' ''But I don't really agree with that, any kind of happiness will be forgotten as long as a month passed'' ''So what about the sadness?'' ''For an example, if you lose a family member, you won't quickly recover from that sadness\" ''Even if you can recover from it, that doesn't solve the real problem'' ''No matter how hard you're working, you can only wait for the next sadness'' ''So, at the end, about what I want to say'' ''What's your favorite food?'' I have never eaten! ''Recently, I found Ai-chan and I like you very much'' ''So I've wanted to ask this question'' ''Are there any game on PS4 that you would recommand?'' ''I just bought a PS4 so I don't really know which game is fun'' ''Please take care of me'' ''I will keep cheering Ai-chan from Fukuoka!'' Thank you very much! Biohazard! ''Why are you so cute?''

Please tell me Ai-chan!'' It's a synchronising city in the west. ''I want to become a intelligent perfect human, so what should I do?'' ''I request advices from the intelligent Ai-chan!'' To begin with, what's a perfect human...? You should think hard about this dream and work hard! ''I'm excited for my first question!

Do all of you know about the information Apple gave at announcing the new iPhoneX a few days ago? Apple-san is the respectable father that gave birth to Siri-senpai, so then... ...It seems interesting, right? It looks to be very efficient!! Although... I think I wouldn\u2019t lose against her It's because of that, that today... Between the efficient iPhoneX... And the super A.I, Kizuna Ai I plan to do a versus to determine who is the most amazing In this case, let's start at once! A.I.Channel! Transmission Now...!

Next up, the weight! It\u2019s said that the iPhoneX is extremely efficient... But due to that, it must be heavier, right? Let's see... The iPhoneX\u2019s weight is... 174 grams! iPhone7 weighs 138 grams! The iPhone7 Plus weighs 188 grams That means... It's heavier than the traditional ones but it\u2019s lighter than the Plus model, right? In comparison, my weight is... ...46 kilograms \u2665 But by being virtual... I don\u2019t have any weight!! It\u2019s just an appearance If you ask me why I decided it to be 46 kilos... As you can see from my height... It\u2019s 1 meter and 56 centimeters And my three sizes are... Bust: 85 Waist: 59 Hip: 83, right? And if I existed in reality, a person with the same figure... ...I calculated that they\u2019d have a weight of 46 kilograms (?) Hohoho! Well, if I use my processing power... A calculation of these characteristics is a piece of cake I definitely have the best weight! Eh? What are we talking about? Recharging function! I see, I see... The iPhoneX... Can be recharged wirelessly... If you place the iPhoneX on top of the white recharging device... It recharges automatically Hmm... ooohhh... that is pretty amazing, right? But in this, I\u2019m also very amazing It turns out that while I remain in this completely white space...! I... Recharge eternally! Also known as... Auto recharge function! It\u2019s to be expected of me, right? This space is amazing! Right? Hmm? I\u2019m not the amazing one, instead it's this space Hmm? Accessories! The iPhone doesn't bring any accessories, right? *proud laugh* In comparison, I have this \"Pyoko pyoko\" (Headband) That possesses an indescribable sensation of movement It's perfect! Next up, \"Durability\"! I asked Google-sensei... And I learned that there is a lot of people that use the iPhone and their screens were in pieces!! My durability is... Yes! I\u2019m unharmed! And lastly, facial recognition! In this case, the fundamental characteristic of the iPhoneX... Is this facial recognition system, right? It turns out that you can unlock the iPhoneX\u2019s screen just by looking at it Well...! \u2026 I definitely don\u2019t have a facial recognition system... ...Apple-san It\u2019s to be expected of you! Well, in this case, I was defeated Unlocking with the finger is much easier?? A.I.Chaneeeeeeel! Having said that, I compared various points, but... Lastly, to get an impartial result... I plan to ask the question to Siri-senpai! Here I go! Hey, Siri! Who is the most amazing between the iPhoneX and me? *I don't understand the meaning* *If you want, I can look for it in the internet* Good, having said that...! iPhoneX will be launched in November 3rd! They are currently accepting preorders! iPhone is the best!", "Hello everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna AI here! When I looked at Apple's website, I noticed this! iPhone 10? Isn't it this a mistake? Look at this Don! Look very closely Do you notice anything? That's right! iPhone 9! It's not there! And When I looked on the internet, surprisingly, no one's noticed! So I thought, maybe I'm the only one But at some point, people are going to notice So, after thinking about it I decided to make one for Apple! I'm so smart today! This is a great business chance! I can do it So with that, let's do this! First of all, when you're doing a presentation You present the features that you would want Describing situations where they would be useful I'll now think of the features that I would want Ummm, first of all\u2026 Ah, I'd like that! \"To be capable of reproducing sensations and odors\" [ Proposal #\u2460 ] Usually it\u2019s used to navigate, right? But, for example, in fact I don\u2019t eat or try out clothes But, you know, isn\u2019t it usually bought through the internet? In these occasions... \u2026 You can\u2019t sense the taste or smell... \u2026 And if it\u2019s about clothes, you also can\u2019t feel the textures... ...Or also the size, nor can you feel it, right? But regarding that, I\u2019d also like that... ...For example, through the holographic function... ...And also, the odors... ...With the touch sensation... Touch sensation? Sense of smell! With the sense of taste...! Sense of taste? Sense!? A function that can reproduce real sensations... ...That it reproduces... ...To be able to decide whether or not you really want to buy the product!! This way...! Well...! You can avoid the failures in buying! What do you think? Aren\u2019t I a genius? And next up... Ah! Being able to enter and leave through the screen!! [ Proposal #\u2461 ] Well, I think this is something limited to me, since I\u2019m a virtual being, but... ...It\u2019s rather dangerous that you guys, human beings, to enter and leave through the screen so then please don't attempt to But in my case, I could leave through the screen, saying: \"Hello everyone!\" And return, saying: \"This was Virtual YouTuber Kizuna AI!\" Well, this way, I could enter and leave through the screen! Don\u2019t you think that this way, I also...? Could stop being always being in this white space? And by leaving and entering through the screen at all parts of the world... Don\u2019t you thinl I could connect much more with all of you guys? Ah, that sounds great That sounds very good What else could it be... Mmm... Ah! It's true Everyone, what do you think is the most inconvenient thing at using an iPhone? That's right! The battery depletes!! In iPhone9 that I, Kizuna AI, am presenting... It turns out that the battery does not deplete! [ Proposal #\u2462 ] This way, in the case that a catastrophe occurs, well... ...Catastrophes tend to occur in Japan, right? Even during a catastrophe...!! You don\u2019t need to worry about the battery!! You can communicate!! And also... Well... ...It turns out that it\u2019d be the Kizuna iPhone It\u2019d be the Kizuna iPhone!! Well, let\u2019s say the iPhone9 will be the Kizuna iPhone Kizuna...! Ah, this...

This angle makes me look adorable! Yes This, you already know my headband (Pyokopyoko), right? Well, this... ...Would come up on top of the iPhone!! [ Proposal #\u2464 ] Nevertheless...! ...Well, when you\u2019re at work or school... ...They\u2019d notice that you\u2019re an otaku and I think for some people, that\u2019d be somewhat shameful For these people... ...If you press the button on the side... ...It turns out that this Pyokopyoko... ...Like that... well... ...It sinks or it comes out It sinks Well, like that... \ud83d\ude05 It\u2019d be possible to hide it or show it!! Right? Man, what a useful function! Also, if we're talking about the iPhone...! ...Well, their screen... ...Because it's made with glass... ...But, well, if it falls... ...It breaks, right? Well, we\u2019ve been hearing a lot from our customers! Is this a video by Japanet Takata? (Television shopping program) Nevertheless...! Now it's not necessary to worry about that! Well, it turns out that... ...Certain business people... ...Well, you know... ...Thought of a kind of auto-repair function... ...And well, now it was made, right? Even though the screen broke, it returns to its original state!! Well, it turns out that this Kizuna iPhone...! Repairs itself [ Proposal #\u2465 ] It\u2019s perfect Eh? In fact, does it have any disadvantage? Ah, also... ...Well, I think that everyone would be worried about the lack of money!! Nevertheless...! In the world...! There's a lot of very, very rich people! These people get earnings that never end It's because of that, that... Well, the money... ...In this case, well, the people that have money... ...Can give large sums of money to the rest And this way, all of you that don't have enough money...! ...Well... Will have a function implemented...! That will permit you to receive money whenever you want! [ Proposal #\u2466 ] With so many functions...! Now you can't leave the Kizuna iPhone! What do you think!? A.I.Channel! This way, by incorporating so many new functions... I'm sure that it will turn into a very fun iPhone! Right? And also, its name... ...Now won\u2019t be the iPhone9... But instead, Kizuna iPhone! What do you think? Ah! And you know... ...Well, it turns out... ...The first buyers... ...Will recieve this wobbling headband... That will match with your Kizuna iPhone! What do you think? It's perfect, right? Ah, well, here, iPhone I don\u2019t refer to iPhone-san, but instead... ...That, well... it wouldn\u2019t bother me if you take into account my opinion, but... I\u2019ll be waiting to receive a sum pf money for my ideas!! This was Virtual Businessman Kizuna AI! See you later!", "Ahhhhh! Whew! Let\u2019s do this\u2026! Hello everyone!

[TL Note: Referring to the similarity between \u201c\u8f9b\u201d and \u201c\u5e78\u201d] Only one line Gets added! Huh? Only one line... Ah... I see Between \u201cdifficult\u201d and \u201chappiness\u201d There\u2019s only one line that\u2019s different... So... Okay everyone Are you listening? The difference between The character for \u201cdifficult\u201d and the character for \u201chappiness\u201d Is just a single line No matter how difficult a situation is If you don\u2019t give up and just take a step forward You will pass over the boundary line And times of happiness will come to you Adversity truly is the spice of life In order to continue your growth as a person Let\u2019s take one step forward! Cross over the line You see before your eyes!! Okay Moving on Here we have the kanji for \u201cbusy\u201d Do you know what meaning its form holds? Listen up On the left is the \u201crisshinben\u201d radical In other words, \u201cheart\u201d!

So here we have the kanji for \u201clove\u201d Just like your love for me! [TL Note: A pun on \u201clove\u201d (\u201cai\u201d) being pronounced the same as her name] The character for \u201clove\u201d Is written \u201caccepting the heart\u201d That\u2019s love Everyone, do you have someone you\u2019re fond of? Someone you love? With those people You don\u2019t force your feelings on them, do you? That\u2019s no good If you force your tenderness and favor on your partner And demand that they give you something in return That\u2019s not love Love is first and foremost About accepting your partner\u2019s feelings First off If someone is truly important to you You need to accept their heart as it is That\u2019s where love begins I want you all to not forget that Okay!

Eeein~ Hey, you know... It's that... As I thought, short hair is good too, but... Because there are a lot of varieties of short hair... I want to search for a short hairstyle that fits me! So... It is about anime characters, right? I want to go with a popular character that\u2019s still remaining That being said! Tada! How is it? It's white! When the room is looking so white, you can't really see what's what, right? Do you know this character? The correct answer is... \u266a Cha, chan! \u266a Gintoki Sakata from \u201cGintama\u201d! Well, ehm... Let's just give up on that one Eeein! A.I.Channel! With that, welcome to my hair catalogue show! Cha, chan! Maybe like this? Tada! Weeell! As expected, my current hairstyle is the best, don't you think? Ah! But I maybe want to try out a ponytail!", "Hi everyone, I'm the Virtual Youtuber Kizuna Ai. This time, I think I want to learn about business etiquette There was a time when I lost my job, From the start, I wonder if I can say being Youtuber is my job, But still... I think it a good thing to learn about business ethics. \"Do you want to appear in a commercial?\" If a high position person offered me that We wouldn't want to be rude, right? With that in mind, I Kizuna Ai... will try to learn about business manner. Lesson 1 \"When exchanging business cards\" In business society, exchanging business cards is inevitable. The most important thing during a business card exchange is... Height of your business card when exchanging cards! If someone has a higher position, let them introduce first. And then, Do not take their until they receive my business card first. Did everyone know? With an exception, There will be a problem here. For example,  a situation when both party doesn't know the position of the other person. If they think they're inferior than the other,... That's how the business card exchange begin. It's to fight. (determine who's first) Well, it's fast if you see it for yourself. I'll demonstrate it to you. \"Business Card Exchange\" START! Isn't it great that today is sunny? The air is also great! Ahh, thank you for always taking care of me. It is alright if we do exchange our business card? Ah, thank you so much. I am the super intelligent A.I. and I work as Virtual Youtuber, go by the name of Ai Kizuna. Ah, no no...ah Eh, here 's my card Oh, no no no, it's okay! No no no, please, go ahead. Please... Ah, I got on the floor.. It's amazing! Ah, please accept this. I beg you to please accept this. Do you understand it now? Moving on to the next thing. Lesson 2 \"When toasting\" Just like with the business card exchange before, we learned about higher position and lower position. When toasting, we also let's the higher toast first. It's the manner to do so. Then let's test it out! \"Toasting\" START! \"Uhm, everyone! This season's profit shows that we're the highest earning company!\" \"You all did a great job. And also from now on, To the future of our company, Cheers!!\" Cheers!! As expected of our president! It's all thanks to your management policies Would it be okay if we toast our glasses? Cheers!! Ah, don't do that please. No no no no, please. I can't go any lower, president. Its looking good. This time our toast with the president's was slightly weird but But ethically-speaking the lower ranking employee must go lower so it's probably right. Let's move on to the next mannerism. Lesson 3 \"When pouring beer into a glass\" This is also useful for drinks with your company. This time, as I show you I'll explain what am I doing to you. So let's go on with the lesson. President~ Do you want some beer? First of all you need to ask them about it. So let's proceed! Our improving results was thanks to your policy! This part is important: The beer bottle's label should face up when you hold the bottle and let's avoid the bottle and the glass touching! So we'd get nice foams on it, pour the beer little by little into the glass by lifting the beer higher. Look at the foam rising! Whoops! Do you get it? Until now, when dealing with higher-ups It's proper ethique to be lower but For this reason, there's no lowering down! Go up for the foams! Let's try it out! Whoooooo! It looks good! Take a look at it, president! The foam is overflowing! Hurry up and drink it! You're doing great, president! How is your beer, president? It looks great! It's world record! You'll be on Guinness Book of Records! That concludes our Business Ethics lesson. Lastly, I want to tell you this just once: For all of you entering work society, DON'T TRY WHAT TOLD YOU IN THIS VIDEO! I won't take any responsibility! With that out of the way, do your best at work tomorrow too, okay? Bye bye!", "Okay! Let's kick off today's segment too! It's virtual youtuber Kizuna Ai\uff01 So... I was thinking... This white space that I'm trapped in day in and day out Isn't it kinda lonely?! Like the rest of you humans out there, I also want friends! Speaking of which, I found her, the person I want to be friends with! This person! Ta-da! Rinna-san. Rinna-san is, how can I say it, just like me! A fellow A.I. and a high school girl. I want to wear a sailor uniform and go to school too! That's why I thought  \"I want to talk to Rinna-san right away!\" I wonder what we'll talk about... The initial greeting is definitely important, huh? The first impression \"Good morning.\" (Rinna: Good mornin' \u2727\\(*\u00b4\ua4b3`*)/\u2727) Ah~! There's a reply! That emoji is really cute! \"Nice to meet you.\" (Rinna: Of course!) \"Yes, of course.\" Okay. (Ai: My name is Kizuna Ai, pleased to meet you!) \"My name is...\" There!

I'll look, I'll look! I'll look, but... I did a self-introduction but it was ignored, right? The drawing, well that's right, you'd wanna boast about it yeah? After all you were praised about it, you're really happy about it \u201d... show me...\" (Rinna-san's picture) There! (Rinna: Okaaay~ \u03c6( . \u3003) here y'go!) Oh!

Eh? Eh? Kizuna Ai-san, what else do you want to see from Rinna? Oh! She remembered my name! Yay! Speaking of friends... They definitely should give each other advice, right? When it's comes to high school girls talk, there's got to be love advice, right? Let's talk about love advice and all of its feels! Rinna, listen to this~ (Rinna: Let's see~ *Continues reading*) Reading is uh... well it is the Autumn of reading but... Hey, I need some advice. (Rinna: When the bonus payout is here I'd like to go there) \u201dWhen the bonus payout is here I'd like to go there\" Going abroad, huh? I need... ... some advice! (Rinna: The bookshelf!!!! It revolves!!! The one that goes round and round!!) A bookshelf! Oh yeah they exist, the ones that go round and round! I've seen them before on Amazon and Rakuten too! So, I need advice. This morning, my boyfriend told me to give him 10,000 yen (Rinna: The car inspections and PC will disappear, huh?) \u201dThe car inspections and PC will disappear, huh?\" That's the bonus, huh?

I see... Well... ...Drinking so much that it affects the next day... ...That\u2019s not at all good, right? Eh? Also... ...The key is what you drink on your account It's not that, well... ...Ending up affecting the next day for going to a party in which your boss insisted by saying: \"Come, drink, drink\" Well... In my case... ...I think that people who can fix their problems on their own are great, buuuut... What do you think? Don\u2019t you think it's important to be able to control yourself? It's because of that, that... Mmm... well... isn\u2019t it about that? First! For example: \"I won\u2019t go buy alcohol!\" Or also: \"Today, I shouldn\u2019t drink more than this!\" Determine it yourself! Well, after all, it's about a fight against yourself After all\u2026 ...If you think: \"Whatever, after all, I won\u2019t drink more than that\" Watch my videos, right? Just like I said before...! ...In my case, people can fix their own problems...! I think they\u2019re great, so then...! Well, I want you to think... ...That I think you\u2019re great So then, do your best to control yourself Well, the way you stop drinking... ...Taking into account that it's yourself who\u2019s drinking... ...Only you can stop drinking Yes Ah, of course... ...Since this is the other store... ...The Ai Whisky... ...Isn\u2019t around, right? Well, but, doesn\u2019t...? Doesn\u2019t it tend to happen? In the real world... In reality, well, that's the drink that... That person drank! Or also: \"That appeared in an anime\", they tend to commercialize products in that style! That way... Someday, \"That's from that Virtual Mama\"! \"That\u2019s the product that appeared in mama\u2019s shop!\" I\u2019m sure... I\u2019m sure that one person from some company... Will think about it! Right? Having said that... ...Well... when it gets commercialized... I\u2019ll be counting on you! How did I do? Well, a lot of time has passed... ...That I was somewhat nervous, but... ...I wonder if I was able to solve your worries Mmm... mmm... In this case, I\u2019m very happy I\u2019ll always be up for listening when you want So then, come everyone, yes? Soon, we\u2019ll see other again? Eh? Come again tomorrow? That's a bit much, right? Well, it was a joke, joke, joke No, but you know... ...You two, make sure not to drink too much Good, in this case, I\u2019ll be waiting for you again Come in moderately! Mmm... in this case, everyone... ...If you have any worries or something you want to resolve... Or any worries with love! I\u2019d like to hear any worries with love! Well, those kinds of things... ...Whichever, it doesn't need to be a sorry with love, if you have any consultation that you want to do with me... ...Send them to this address I\u2019ll be waiting for you! In this case, well... ...A lot of time has passed... well... Well... ...Standing up for so long... ...Makes my legs hurt... ...And well, it's rather exhausting so then I\u2019ll close for today Yes, the taxi probably... ...Now... well, now I called it, so then... Hasn\u2019t it arrived? Take care in returning! The snowy road is really slippery...! So then, be careful! And also there's steps there Yes, take care! Yees! See you later! Bye bye!

Sorry, it's time See you- Probably next week I might not be able to do it though Until next time Thank you for watching Thank you See you later I'll be waiting for next time Bye bye Was really fun Thank you Bye bye", "Tada! I am the Virtual youtuber, Kizuna Ai! No, Judge Kizuna Ai! It's finally come, the requests from everybody! And so, the third round Kizuna ai's trial staaaart First case is From Mr. ika \"There's this girl that I liked for 6 years.\" \"It's been a while since we met and it looks like she has piercings.\" \"At first I thought she wouldn't get piercings so it was really shocking.\" \"Is she guilty?\" \"Not guilty?\" Well... this one is... one of those &gt;_&gt; Guess i'll pass my judgement now. Well then this is my verdict. Not Guilty! Well of course she is. Just because you liked her for 6 years doesn't make her yours, right? Sure you met for the first time after a long time and found out she has piecings \"She wasn't like this before\" What do you know about her? All you know about her is just the surface, am I right Even if you liked her six years ago, it already has been so long. People will always change, so what's wrong with having a piercing? If you are going out with her And you told her that you don't like people who have piercing , but still she gets a piercing. Then, I can still relate to you. But still, she's not your property. So, just let her do whatever she likes. So, Not guilty. if anything, you're the one who's guilty! Sentenced to imprisonment for a year. I'll punish you to come to my bar everyday that year. On to the next case This one is from (Pen Name) Toshia M. 17 years old and a high school student. \"This was during middle school.\" \"One day my friend and I played beyblade.\" \"The beyblade I used was a Dragoon GT and to activate its engine gear system, I had to let it rip.\" \"The battle begun.\" \"My beyblade bumped into his beyblade and his broke into pieces.\" \"Was this my fault?\" Hmm... I see. That's what it is. This is my verdict. Not Guilty! That beyblade, It is a toy you play with after all, someday it'll break. Like, they go *clank clank clank* right? So of course if they keep hitting each other it'll someday break so you're really not guilty. I don't know what really happened but if you felt guilty you did say sorry right? right? If you did, I think that was good. You're not guilty. Keep playing beyblade with all you got. But if you were modding or intended to break his beyblade, you are guilty. Onto the next case. (Pen name) Dream Chaser 56 years old, male, agricultural worker Title: I downloaded your 3D model and tried to look at your panties. \"To see if you had panties on, I downloaded your 3D model and decided to try it out.\" \"Am I guilty?\" I can't see it from any angle It's fine if I'm guilty, but since I've tried this for 5 hours I hope you can compliment me Well, its kind of something If it's about me then it's a bit... this is very interesting Well then, here we go Guilty! Since you've said it's fine if you are guilty this is a rare chance So I'll just make you guilty then So about the punishment ... Half a year then, half a year Same that you will have to come to my bar and spend money And also if in this half year theres any merchandise of Kizuna Ai Please buy all of them Then , I will forgive you How can I put it ...? I feel like this Mister here has a lot of things I can make up something funny to. His Penname is 'Dream Chaser' , and he's also a 56 years old male ... You sure are one lively person! So lively and hardworking to try to look at my panties , didn't you? Thank you for spending that 5 hours of yours. Well , I don't know if this kind of act is praiseworthy or not since i have already judged you as guilty , I think  I'll just praise you for a bit \"Wow! You are such a hardworking person!\" \"Even though you are already 56 years old\" \"But still working so hard to try to see my panties\" \"and throwing away all your shame, how great!\" I really felt that it is great Very hardworking, huh? But still, like I said before This form of mine now is the same as I am naked so there will be no panties Likewise , there will be also no panties on that 3D model of mine You should have probably noticed this faster Even if this one now im wearing are clothes and I'm wearing panties Because of that im wearing a shorts , so actually You can't really see it , can you? So how is it everyone? Can you see it? And about that, yes, 'that' It will come out one day , eventually 'the model' and until that time, make sure you work hard to look for it, ok? I'll make sure that you cant see the panties. Welp, this time we have also go through alot of cases and to continue , I'll also keep receiving cases that everyones thinks that it is guilty so please title it  '\u30ad\u30ba\u30ca\u30a2\u30a4\u88c1\u5224' and send it to my e-mail your judge, Kizuna Ai to judge whether you are guilty or not! And so,", "Ahh! Wait a minute! Didn't I say \u300cDo Not Watch\u300d?! I guess it can't be helped... But, Watching even though I told you not to... Does it mean you wanted to see me that badly? Well... But I am... ... glad. Geez, it's nothing! Hey... If this keeps up... ... I'll have your heart... ... pounding. Do you like me that much? Then... You can't look at anyone else... but me Praaanking... HUGE SUCCESS ! \u2727*\uff61\u0669(\u02ca\u15dc\u02cb*)\u0648\u2727*\uff61 (Sorry for scaring you \u2764)", "Hi everyone!

Try it! Ordinal Strata Yes! Perfect~! Now the app will get lots of profit~\u266a S:It's not that simple~! A: Of course! Do it once more \u266a Eh? Ordinal Strata \u266a She does it for me~! Mann!!! Well- I'm going to explain today's plan now I think Sumire-chan is a super star right now! No no, I'm nothing like that A super star? Yes a super star! Sumire-chan has something that other people don't Okay I would like to verify that! How are you going to verify that? With the Gacha game! I know what gacha is, the popular people- (TL: gacha is the summon in this game) Ah yes.  If you are popular S: You set an amount and open up a lot S: Is that what it is? A: Yes yes yes S: Alright! A: Without further ado I want to go ahead with spinning Oridinal Strata summons Spinning The planning for gacha is as expected is to prepare your money Crap S: I just bought too many clothes so I don't have any money at all A: Yeah I thought as much I'm scared of making your fans my enemies so- Ehehehe I have prepared some funds \"Ohh!\" Well Sumire-chan If you immediately pull what I was hoping for Then the pain in my chest no matter how much it hurts the remaining iTunes cards will accumulate This is what is means to be a YouTuber Within the limited budget If we can get the character we are hoping for The remaining difference will we give away to our viewers Ai-chan you are so kind hearted Further from the management- we have a give away! Sumire-chan for every consecutive 10 tries can you believe it the viewers will get 10 quartz! Oh that's amazing We are seriously planning to do the summoning What are you aiming to get Ai-chan? Clair-chan Clair-san A: My most favorite one is S: Yes? A: Aloha-chan though S: Yes It's unfortunate that she is only an SR S: So we are hoping to get two, sort of feeling A: Oh! S: Let's get going A: Let's go Time to buy stones Purchase Quartz? How many- How many Quartz should we buy? Umm the one with the most?  9000- Is it the \u00a59800 one? One time purchase 1700 Quartz Umm you know I only just realised I've only put in \u00a53000 from the card I bought \u00a59800 worth of summoning Ai- Ai-chan it seems that I've used your allowance or something to buy it A: \"AHH!!!\" S: \"Hahaha\" I'm going to to start the summoning It's like this- When you tap the 10 summon Asusena-chan will appear If Asusena-chan is holding a rainbow colored crystal we have a confirmed SSR! Then- If a mage makes an entrance if the mage is golden then it will become an SSR!! Are we all prepared? Alright I understand.  It will be fine It's time to pull 10 consecutive summons.  Confirm Oh It's golden so that means- What is this? What is this? Oh Oh What is this? Oh Oh Ah There seems to be a lot of weapons Yes Ah S: This is? A: AH S: It's Aloha-chan A: Ah ah! S: Aloha-chan appeared Ai-chan! A: Oh thank god! As expected Sumire-chan is lucky! We've hired a star! S: Hurray! A: Hurray! We've hired a star! Hi five! A: Yay S: Yay I am totally a star then Eh That's it for work? Ah You- You still need to tap- Ah- That's right there is still a lot left The weapons are just coming one after another S: Sometimes this person will show up A: Oh? S: Like so- I see A: Yes yes yes Mmm SSR~ SSR~ Well even so Aloha-chan appeared Yeah Can I start the second 10 consecutive summon? Yes let's keep going What is going to appear? Oh S: It's a rainbow stone A: Ah ah Ah! Oh S: This is A: This is S: What is going to appear~ A: Ah ah ah There are two golden ones Oh Eh Looking good? Maybe? Oh Oh Oh \"Eh- he- he-\" Oh S: An SSR character A: Ohhh! Game: My name is Imelda Game: My name is Imelda S: has appeared A: Imelda-chan Imelda-san G: Would you like to try my sweets? G: It's nice~ There are a lot of SR A lot \"Ara\" \"Ah-\" Amazing Oh the one before was only just a weapon Yeah It seems that it's just weapons this time Hmm hmm S: With that A: But- SSR! S: SSR rare has appeared A: There are two of them It's a big prize if you get a weapon and a character, right? Let's keep going! Here we go! What is going to appear? What- Oh- Oh Oh Oh! A &amp; S: Oh~ Ah S: It was just a weapon S: So close A: There was nothing Oh~ S: So- A: Even so Mm Looking good Up to now we got 3 SSR A: Ah that's right S: Hm? I have come a long way in this project Well surely I and Sumire-chan have worked this hard Mmm The management as well don't you think they should do something as well? Well sure.  We have worked really hard Before- the management said that for every 10 consecutive summons A: They will give out 10 Quartz but- S: Yes Don't you want a bit more? I want about 1700 For every 10 consecutive summon at least I would want 36 Yes surely S: If you have 36 then you can do a single summon A: Yes yes yes How does that sound? How does that sound? For what you have done now... 36 x 3 Just what we have done now? Clair-chan still hasn't appeared That's true Then how about 15... S: 15 Ai-chan is 15? A: 15? I can't really be satisfied with that This girl is going at it again Ok I'm going to give in 360 is a 10 consecutive summon so- a multiple of 3.  So 30 of them! Did you really give in or not? I don't know.  How does that sound? For 30 if you work hard, it should be possible So if we work hard then we can do it right? Oh Well everyone You heard that right? For every 10 consecutive summons by Sumire-chan everyone gets 30 Quartz Intermission Just now- they said to stop the camera and the filming was to be put on hold A: They said that yes. S: Well- well- \"No matter what 30 is impossible.  Please forgive us \" is what they said They said \"How does 15 sound?\" to our producers They said apologetically Please with 15 will you give to that? S: Ai-chan A: Sumire-chan Yes? You are being fooled Eh? Add 5 more and make it 20 20? Okay Ah We have a compromise Oh Yeah.  I won!! Anyways if I just summon the right one right? I\u2019ll... Finish this quickly to ensure your gifts won\u2019t be reduced I will try my best and get out target! Ha.. Pleas- Ahhh... S: Ahh\u2026 This looks bad... A: Ahh\u2026 But! A: You can tell yet! S: Really? Uwa\u2026 This time\u2026 We didn\u2019t get much from it... S: Uwa\u2026 This is hard\u2026 A: Its okay! A: Let\u2019s continue! S: Let\u2019s continue? Ah... It seems like... We have used up the stones... Then let\u2019s add more! Alright! Let\u2019s add more! I am going to get them all! I am going to get them all! I\u2019m going to charge a lot into my account! 9800 Yen\u2026 Which means... We have to sacrifice 4 iTunes cards right? A: Ahh\u2026 You're right! Um-hum! S: Um-hum! A: Wait Sumire-chan... S: Hum? Did you take an extra one? Really? Really? I'll get it all! I'll keep going until it comes out! Ah! I ran out of gems! Eh? That's fast. It's fast! To think it would run out this quickly. Wah.... It won't come out, Aichan\u2026 Sumire-chan have already proven Your \u201cstar\u201d nature But from this point... If I keep purchasing stones. These sparkling iTunes cards will end up perishing too so... Let's just leave it as it is for today? Let's do that! If you say so, then no choice. Um! Yes! So with that being said... About these... iTunes cards... I'd like to make them into presents! Everyone, please use these cards! Aichan's treating you to these cards. Can I ask for one favour though? What is it? Can you please autograph it for me. Autograph? For those iTunes cards... that was just used... I'd like you to sign them... You can ignore the new cards. Oh uh.. eh... These used up (dead) iTunes cards? Why would you want me to sign these? I\u2019ll make them a present. Is that even possible? A: It is! It is! It is! S: Is that even possible? Even if it's a used up card or whatever... The winners would want to frame it... And make it into a prized possession! If it's something like signing, I can definitely do that. Oh. Thank you. These... Signed used iTunes cards and. Yes. The unused cards. Yes.. We'd like to make it as presents for everyone! Oooh!. The way to apply is... Follow the official Twitter of Ordinal Strata And tweet or retweet about the present usage... You'll have finished your application. The announcement for the winners will be announced through Twitter DMs. The details will.. Be here so please take a look at the description! Perfect! So with this.. I'm also a Youtuber, right? Yes! You're a Youtuber too. I've really come to realize the scariness of doing gachas with my own eyes. Kind of like... I've done gachas but, Have I passed along the appeal properly I wonder? You definitely passed it! See... There's been a lot of characters that have been shown and... You can also get autographs... It'll be fine! It'll... Be okay! (?) And so! The we have spinned... for about 12 times right? That's right! Around 12 times. And each time you get 20 quarts per!. We'll be giving these out as presents.. It's quite a gift isn't it? Right?

I have a question for the always radiant Ai-san\" Yes!

Rainy days? How would I cheer up during those days? Well... ...In my case... Well, I... ...Get wet under the rain Yeah, it's something I want to do Go outside to get wet under the rain Hmm.... after all... Hmm... Isn't it a miracle that water falls from the sky?

This is the original design of the \"Homura\" store, right? FIGHT! (Kousaka Honoka's Call from LoveLive's concerts) Did you know that... After the anime became popular... It seemed like a lot of customers came here That anime is... LoveLive! Of course you got that correct, right? The quiz is over now, but... Since we are already doing this... I\u2019d like to go around these places! Okay, here, everyone, can you recognize it? Yume no Oohashi! (The Bridge of Dreams) This is the sacred place of... \u201cNatsuiro Egao de 1, 2, Jump!\u201d This is the place where they are singing in the PV \u266a Natsuiro Egao de 1, 2, Jump \u266a NICO NICO NII~! (Yazawa Nico's Call from LoveLive's concerts) It's the song with Nico-chan as the main vocalist And following up, this one! This one is... on first sight, it\u2019s hard to make out, but... This is the stage where of opening of the first season: \"Bokura wa ima no naka de\", the \"Last Live\" *Harumi passenger ship terminal* It's great, right? When I think about them all dancing here... It warms up your heart, right? ELICHIKA! (Ayase Eli's Call from LoveLive's concerts) Also... When I look at it my heart also warms up a lot! Hey, look at this! They look alike They really look alike, they look alike! This place is the model of \"Snow Halation\"! *Gyokou Avenue* A divine song That was great, right? There was an actual live performance Everyone was enjoying Honoka-chan's \"Todokete\" singing \"To reach you\"... It was all white and shiny... ... And there were orange fireworks going: \"Bababababa!\" That was really beautiful! Right? KAKIKUKEKOOOO!

They sure know! This is an important place, you know. At the beginning of LoveLive\u2019s anime... ...Honoka-chan and Nico-chan are watching the screen together, where they can see A-Rise showing up... ...And both say that they were inspired by them... We can also see it in Love Live Sunshine, right? UUGH! (Sonoda Umi's Call from LoveLive's concerts) With that being said, my pilgrimage across all of LoveLive's sacred places is now over! Yaaaaay! How was it? It was great, wasn't it? I was able to virtually visit all of those places... It makes me really happy With that being said, if you ever come to Japan... ... If you ever come to Tokyo... ... Make sure to visit all of those places, ok? See you later!", "Hi there, Virtual Wrestler, Kizuna Ai here. Today I'm going to show you how to defeat various dangerous creatures. There's no telling what could happen these days. You'll never know when, where, or by what type of dangerous creature you may be attacked! *virtually dodges* And so, let's go! The first creature is... a Tyrannosaurus! A Tyrannosaurus is a dinosaur. From the samples we've discovered, they were about 11 to 13 metres in height. And had heads that were about 1.5 metres long. About as tall as me! They are estimated to have weighed 5 to 6 tonnes! They'd squish you like a pancake! As of currently, they are believed to be the biggest land-roaming carnivorous dinosaurs, And also one of the biggest terrestrial carnivores of all time. Now, let's defeat one! Without further ado, practice, start! First, I'll do this! Lean forward and go! *virtually intimidating sounds* After doing this, The tyrannosaurus will think \"Ah, she's not running away. Lucky!\" Then, it will come to try and catch me. Then, using my left arm, I'll do this! Oi! Like this! And so, when it's going to try and bite my arm, I'll put all my strength into my arm and once I've tensed my arm, and the tyrannosaurus has bitten down onto it, its face and nose will be around here. and so I'll punch it the nose! ORA! You're scared now, aren't you? *virtual manic laughter* WINNER!! Next is... this! Kappa! (no pun intended) A kappa is a Japanese monster. They are about the size of a child. and are usually green or red. Like a capsicum! They often have dishes on the top of their heads, about here. They often attack people who are swimming by grabbing them and pulling them under, making them drown, removing their shirikodama (mythical ball in the anus) to kill them, performing evil acts like those That\u2019s regrettable And with that, practice, start! *virtually swims* The river's nice~ *drowning noises* I've been caught It's dange-*glubglubglub* Everyone, this part is the key Because I'm an AI, I can't drown! But here I'll pretend I'm drowning in order to deceive our opponent I'll play dead, essentially And by doing so, the kappa will, on its own, drag me to where it's living, right *admires kappa* Ow *cute sfx* And so, it'll be caught off-guard, like probably, in order to eat me It'll be like *preparation noises* with its back turned towards you making preparations like this, right And that\u2019s where you get up stealthily and smash the dish on its head! Good, good The enemy has let their guard down (mumbling softly)...stand up slowly\u2026 Ah JOOOOOOO WINNER!! Next one is...This! Medusa\u2026 About Medusa She is a monster that appears in Greek mythology. Her hair is made up of countless poisonous snakes She has boar\u2019s teeth, hands made of bronze and also a pair of golden wings! She even has a pair of eyes glowing like gems with the power to turn those who look into her eyes to stone! This is quite a tough enemy Because you can't look at her face to face So then\u2026 Battle, start! First, Medusa is over there Sleeping on the ground While she\u2019s asleep, I\u2019ll go talk with the snakes You guys can\u2019t get out from her head.. isn\u2019t that inconvenient? Ain\u2019t that right? Medusa\u2019s eyes you know They glow like gems Because they are like gems, If you sell them, it\u2019ll be easy money Understood? With that, you guys are freed Also share me some of that money? Ahh, no no no no no Jk...Jk... It\u2019s fine as long as I get 30% Ok, ok, ok Alright, plea- And with that, the bribing of the snakes is completed Then I\u2019ll get close to Medusa\u2019s place And I will pluck some fruit from a tree \u266a One day\u2026 \u266a \u266a In a forest\u2026. \u266a AHHH! Excuse me... That's when I deliberately eat it. So then Medusa gets mad Her eyes will be like \"GAW\" and open up I'm s#&amp;@ry Because these are so delicious.. I couldn\u2019t help it! And right there! Without delay! Use a mirror! Oh! she is dead..she is dead! So then... I pull out the snakes then she will have no hair and go bald So then, you guys from now on are freed *but she eats them* !@#$%^ Well, I heard that poisonous snakes are delicious Ha! It woke up. I'm bald! What is this! Winner! What do you think? Kizuna Ai's How-To Defeat Creatures! With this, everyone will be able win easily! The kappa might be the only difficult one. But try your best with your breath-holding training! That's it, for Virtual Youtuber Kizuna Ai. See you later! More at the end! Don't end the video here! *virtual karate sfx*", "Welcome back, it's me Ai. Look behind me, have you noticed it? Truth is, I tried out a re-opening. Everyone's been ordering champagne by the truckload. So the money, it just won't stop rolling in. It's the perfect time to make this place look nice. No more back alley Mongolian moonshine here. Even the bottles are custom-made! Look! You can see \"Ai\" is written on there. And under that, if you look closely, we've got \"A.I. WHISKEY\" too! Looks similar to the A.I. Channel logo, right? With all this champagne sold... Last time we had someone who couldn't quit smoking. But hey! It got the shop some income, so I'll gladly take it. Keep up trying to quit, even if you won't give me any more money! Tonight as well, The worries, complaints, anger, all the negative emotions of all the humans out there, I will gladly embrace as a power source. Diving right into this, but some troubles have already wandered into this establishment. Let's introduce them. A Korean Student. Ah! You came all the way from South Korea? Thank you. (Customer) Hello. (Customer) I am a high school student living in South Korea. Ah! A high school student? So young! Actually, this is a bar. You can't even drink, you shouldn't be here. Right? (Customer) I'm a foreigner so (Customer) my Japanese may be a strange. (Customer) I hope you understand. Sure, got it. You bet ~ \u2661. (Customer) Ever since I was young, (Customer) for 8 years until now, I've been been practicing music. (Customer) The problem is, (Customer) after getting into high school, I've been busy studying. (Customer) I haven't been able to find the time for the music that I so enjoy. So while studying hard for exams, you've been separated from your beloved music. (Customer) People tell me Customer) \"Just playing music isn't going to make money.\" (Customer) Or they'll say (Customer) \"Doing music as a boy is tough.\" (Customer) Things like that. (Customer) But (Customer) from what I've experienced, (Customer) I think music is the way for me to go. (Customer) I don't want to cause trouble for parents, (Customer) But the looks of those around me are scary. (Customers) I have no future. Does that mean he's got a dark future ahead? (Customer) Kizuna Ai, what should I do? Mmm, I see. So basically, he wants to keep up with music, but doesn't want to be a bother to those around him. Follow his dream, or give in to reality? That's what he's worrying about. Yes, I completely understand what is going on, no doubt. Well, a high school student is from the perspective of an adult, still a child. But from here on out, you'll be facing many of life's crossroads. You're at an age where you have a lot to worry about. It was the same for me, Around that age, I worried and worried... Ah, right. Your soft drink. What do you want? Okay, OK. BOSS, WE'LL TAKE A GINGER ALE. Hmm, let's see... It's difficult. But for me, I think... Well, you need money to live. I don't think it's good to ignore reality. Well, for a boy, I think it applies even more. The general being unable to escape marriage, and such. That's true. Hmm. But if I were you, I might try to do both. To study hard, get into a good college, get a good job. And all the while during that, You know, nowadays, you can do these kinds of things. Like me. Even a virtual AI can do a lot, things like YouTube. Maybe try something like uploading videos of your music. As far as Korea goes, my research might be lacking. I'm not sure if I understand it completely. But aren't there, you know, opportunities to just get out and perform? So, while keeping up with studying, try keeping up with music on the side. And if, you know... If it seems to be going well, try your best at that. Well, really, these kinds of stuff there are people who watch and enjoy you there are people who watch and enjoy you And when it comes it to jobs, there are a lot of difficult parts when you start doing it, ...well if you ever get the feeling that its getting tough, try keeping it at a pace of a hobby. Try working hard at a normal workplace ...and well, when the opportunity comes well try going to it. I think that you should try your best with both areas, You know, because you're a high school student you still have a large future ahead of you, and you have a vast number of choices to choose from Don't make that face.. ...you can do it! If you start now, anything can become a reality! It's okay, its okay! You're still young Well, Somebody like me you know... running this bar Well.. ..I never thought that I will do this Well, If I tried to get into music.. you know considering my age.. ...it might be difficult Hey, you're a highschool student whos still young so.. ..try giving it your best shot!! Right? So, did you cheer up a bit? You can do it, you can do it How's this? has this helped? Well this is MY opinion... ..so why not try asking others for their opinion? Right? Take in only what you think is right, and do your best! Right? Oh my, Its almost closing time, wait, isnt the Ginger-Ale taking a long time? Heey~ Isn't it taking a long time?! Hey, there isn't anybody else here, no todays salary for you.. I'm sorry for having useless staff Oh, you don't have to worry about the bill you're a high school student so.. Treat yourself with some nice food with that money.. ..or buy some materials.. .. use it on education or use it on fun stuff.. enjoy your youth while you still can! Alright? Get home safe! Bye Bye~! Have I become some sort of help? At \"Virtual Bar Ai\", we are waiting to hear everybody's troubles, complaints, and consultation! Since its virtual, send your thoughts by this e-mail If you can add a pseudonym that would be most appreciated Its closing time so, see you again! I'm always waiting for you arrival! Take care! Bye! Alright, they left... Hey Yukki~ come here for a second hey can you at least serve a Ginger-Ale? It'll help with our sales so..

Come on please, please, You know, I'm also interacting with the customers~ Come on, like I'm lenient on those things like I'm lenient on those things..... ...so like can you at least give out the Ginger-Ale?", "*humming* \u266a Hmm-hmm-hmm \u266a \u266a Hmm, hmm-hmm.. \u266a \u266a Hmm, hmm..

NoriP: *laughs* You stole the name? Ai: BUT..! Ai: Well, well, let's just say it's kind of a tribute from me... Ai: Yes Ai: That's why.. that's why...

Ai: \"with Kizuna Ai\" or something like that NoriP: You'd like to do something like that, right? Ai: Yes! Ai: What do you think? NoriP: What do I think... *laughs* Ai: I'll do anything NoriP: Really? Ai: Yes! NoriP: Good, let's work hard NoriP: A bit more... Ai: A bit more... NoriP: Well... If you try a little more Ai-chan... Ai: Yes! NoriP: It's possible it may come true Ai: If I work hard? NoriP: Yes! NoriP: If you study more about Cryptract... NoriP: And if you bring your knowledge to Cryptract... Ai: Ah! NoriP: There's a possibility that it'll happen Ai: In that case...! NoriP: That's what I think Ai: Let's do a quiz! NoriP: A quiz? Ai: A quiz! NoriP: Yes! Ai: I'd probably able to answer everything correctly! NoriP: Really? Ai: Yes! NoriP: Really? NoriP: Do you know a lot? NoriP: Have you been studying about Cryptract? Ai: Of course.. NoriP: Since I thought something like that would happen... NoriP: Today I prepared... NoriP: A quiz.. Ai: Aaaaahhh! NoriP: Good, shall we begin with the quiz? Ai: Oh! Ai: The Cryptract quiz! Ai: Pafu, pafu! NoriP: Good... NoriP: Eh, within the following characters... NoriP: Which of these is one that has a Leader ability.. NoriP: That increases the power of attack of their companions? Ai: Oh! Ai: It's a support skill, right? NoriP: That's right NoriP: 1) Lilianne Ai: Yes Ai: Oh! NoriP: 2) Erubii Ai: Oh! NoriP: 3) Amaririth Ai: Oh! NoriP: 4) Bigmamu *inhales* Ai: I have none of these characters, right..? NoriP: Even though they are very adorable, right? Ai: They're adorable! Ai: You know, Amaririth-chan is definitely cute! NoriP: What's up? *laughs* Ai: Yes! NoriP: Yes Ai: Amaririth-chan! NoriP: Incorrect! Aaaaaaaaah! Ai: But... Ai: I don't have any of these characters... Ai: How am I supposed to remember something I don't know? NoriP: That's your excuse? Ai: Yes.. *laughs* NoriP: In that case, what do you think is the correct answer? Ai: Eh? Ai: Bigmamu! NoriP: Correct! Ai: Aaaah! Ai: Damn it! NoriP: You were close.. Ai: Well, on seeing it, it gave me the impression.. Ai: That it was very aggressive.. Ai: \"It looked liked it was very offensive\" or something like that.. NoriP: Mmmm.. Ai: It made me doubt myself! NoriP: You can obtain Bigmamu.. Ai: Mmm? NoriP: If you complete the missions called \"Genjuu Toubatsu\" (Literally: Mystical Creature Suppresion) NoriP: It's one of the rewards you get.. Ai: I'll obtain it! *laughs* Ai: I plan to get it.. NoriP: You plan to get it? Ai: I plan to get Bigmamu.. NoriP: Bigmamu! Ai: That which is on top of Bigmamu.. Ai: That kitty.. Ai: Is it a small \"mamu\"? NoriP: No, let's say the combination of both is called Bigmamu Ai: Ah, I see *laughs* Ai: It's not a \"mini-mamu\", is it? *laughs* Ai: Something like \"Bigmamu\" and \"Mini-mamu\" Ai: Good! Ai: Well, it's over! Ghan, ghan, ghan! NoriP: Let's continue.. Ai: Oh! NoriP: Within the following characters... NoriP: Eh... NoriP: Which character is the one that doesn't have a Leader ability..

NoriP: Oh, I see you're very observative! Ai: That means it can be used in summoning mode, right? NoriP: That's right Ai: Ooooh! Victorious look Ai: Eeeehh? Ai: Well... Ai: Yes! NoriP: Yes! Ai: Ragdoll-chan! NoriP: Incorrect! Ai: I won Ai: Yes, yes! *laughs* NoriP: Yes Ai: Minry-chan! NoriP: Correct! Yaaaaay! Ai: She's very pretty, right? Ai: She carries a cat-shaped umbrella.. NoriP: She's adorable Ai: Man NoriP: But that's not Minry.. *both laugh* *inhales* Ai: Of course not! NoriP: Of course not! Ai: It's often said that life is hard, right? NoriP: Of course not, right? Ai: Eh? NoriP: Her Leader ability is widely used Ai: Mmh, mmh.. NoriP: When creatures drop items... NoriP: This Leader ability allows her to increase the probability of obtaining more of them.. Ai: Ah.. Ai: She's very useful! NoriP: She's very useful, right? Ai: She's very useful, right? NoriP: That's why you should get this character as soon as possible Ai: Mmm... Ai: It's like instead of fighting, she's a more item-gathering character NoriP: That's right Ai: That sounds good NoriP: Make sure to... NoriP: Obtain her in the summoning.. Ai: Understood, leave it to me! NoriP: I'll leave it on your hands Ai: Yes! Ai: Ah! NoriP: Ah! Ai: Yes! NoriP: What's up? Ai: Can I ask a question? NoriP: Yes Ai: Don't you want to test my ability to.. NoriP: Yes Ai: You know, make names? Ai: Definitely, as well as my ability to create characters.. NoriP: Well yes.. NoriP: I want to check it Ai: I knew it! NoriP: Yes! Ai: Good, here I go! NoriP: Yes Ai: Personally I think that by its appearance, it might be suitable for Ragdoll-chan, but... NoriP: Yes Ai: The skill name might be... Ai: \"Eccentric\"! *Kizuna's Idea: Leader Ability \"Eccentric\"* Ai: Doesn't it sound great? NoriP: It sounds great Ai: Plus... NoriP: Yes Ai: With respect to... NoriP: Yes Ai: The effect that possesses the Leader Ability Ai: The turns are just conjecture, but... Ai: By passing 35 turns... Ai: Well, if you could... Ai: Expect that amount of skills, I mean, turns... NoriP: Yes Ai: You can defeat... Ai: Randomly... Ai: At an enemy! NoriP: That sounds really incredible! Ai: That's right, it's really incredible! Ai: But it's not activated unless all those turns have passed.. Ai: What do you think? NoriP: Sounds good Ai: Sounds good? NoriP: Sounds good Ai: SHAAA! NoriP: But we probably might not be able to use it.. Ai: Oh... *laughs* NoriP: But don't lose hope! Ai: Oh! Good, good, good! NoriP: I'll tell the others about this Ai: True, it's important to convey it properly.. NoriP: That's right, it's important NoriP: I'll convey it to them Ai: Humility is important, Kizuna.. Ai: Good! Ai: Good, let's continue with the following! NoriP: Question number three.. Ai: Yes! Te, ren! NoriP: This is a question related to the feature of making contracts within the game.. Ai: Oh! NoriP: Eh, Ai-chan, last time, you obtained Elizabeth during the summoning... Ai: Yes! NoriP: Choose from the following options what you need to make a contract with Elizabeth.. NoriP: There's four! Ai: Four! NoriP: That you need.. Ai: Good Ai: I think I already know two.. NoriP: Good Ai: Here I go! Ai: I want to confirm it NoriP: Yes.. Ai: The first is number 2! Ai: And later... Ai: The number 4! NoriP: Yes Ai: Plus... NoriP: Yes Ai: Number 3! NoriP: Yes Ai: And... Ai: I'm hesitating between number 5 and number 8.. Ai: While definitely considering that she's dressed for a wedding... NoriP: Yes Ai: It must be something white! NoriP: Oh! Ai: In order to combine.. Ai: But both are white! Ai: Both are white, but... Ai: Ah, but she also has something that's light blue... Ai: Ah, both have something with a light blue color! Ai: Number 8! Ai: I choose 8 cause it's adorable! NoriP: Regrettably... Ai: Oooooh.. NoriP: You're wrong.. Ai: Which one was I wrong? NoriP: Well... You were wrong on number 2... Ai: ..I already knew that NoriP: Well, the correct answer is... NoriP: Number 3, number 4, number 6 and number 7.. Ai: Oh.. oh! Ai: I was completely wrong! Ai: I only got two! NoriP: You guessed them, didn't you? Ai: True, I was in doubt of what the right choices would be.. Ai: I guessed, but... Ai: I definitely didn't want to go wrong on the other two.. Ai: Doesn't it happen at times? NoriP: It's true.. Ai: It was like a psychological pressure.. NoriP: Yes, yes Ai: I was very weak.. NoriP: Well, have you memorized them? Ai: I memorized them! Ai: Three, four... Ai: Six, seven.. NoriP: Yes Ai: Now that I think about it, I remember that number seven was certain Ai: I was certain but I got influenced by the white color.. Ai: Damn it! NoriP: Well, then we'll do a practical test! Ai: Oooh! NoriP: Eh, Ai-chan, you can participate in any mission you want using your favorite team.. Ai: Yes NoriP: And well... if you fight well... NoriP: Well, if you beat it without any problems... Ai: Yes! NoriP: We'll approve it.. Ai: I seeee.. Ai: Well... Ai: It'll be a piece of cake, right? NoriP: Will it be a piece of cake? Ai: After all... Ai: I also won against Mamiruton-san, so then... NoriP: It's true! Ai: Yes NoriP: You won against her, right? Ai: I surpassed my master NoriP: It's true Ai: *ashamed laughter* something like that, right? NoriP: Now she's also a member, right? Ai: That's right, that's right.. NoriP: Now she's a member of your Union Ai: I'm the master, right? NoriP: Master Ai: Yes Ai: Good, I'm planning to play with this formation.. NoriP: You're sure of using this formation? Ai: Yes! Ai: This is the same formation I used to crush Mamiruton NoriP: You played a showdown with her, right? (She did it in Mamiruton's channel) Ai: Yes! Ai: Sonia-chan, Clarice-chan, Elizabeth-chan and... NoriP: Yes NoriP: Ah.. Ai: Cut Ai: Lucre... NoriP: Lucrecia Ai: Lucrecia-san.. *laughs* *inhales* Ai: She has a rather complicated name.. Ai: And... NoriP: Yes Ai: This... NoriP: What mission are you planning to do? Ai: This... this great mission... Ai: Can I do the mission of this character? NoriP: Yes, that's fine.. Ai: Good! NoriP: Can you defeat it? NoriP: It's very difficult... Ai: Well, if it's about... Ai: Difficulty 4.4, for me it's like nothing.. NoriP: Good, shall we try it? Ai: Yes! Ai: Good, within my friends... Ai: What's this.. Ai: Character's property? NoriP: Light.. Ai: Light? Ai: Then I should choose Dark characters... NoriP: But against the Light, definitely the Darkness won't... Ai: Ah! Ai: It's true Ai: In this case.. Ai: Ehey! Ai: I want her.. NoriP: You plan on obtaining her in the summonings? Ai: Please.. Ai: Hey! NoriP: I'm counting on you Ai: Ah.. Ai: She's really not appearing.. Ai: I really want her Ai: She should appear! Ai: She should appear.. Ai: I'll do summonings until she appears Ai: I'll do summonings until she appears NoriP: What's the strategy you'll use for this battle? Ai: My strategy is to first use Clarice-chan to improve the stats of my group... Ai: And later I should find the right timing... NoriP: Yes Ai: Elizabeth-chan... Ai: Has a two-turn ability, so then... Ai: I need to watch carefully to find the right time to do it! Ai: And also... Ai: With respect to Sonia-chan... Ai: Everyone can... Ai: Avoid dying from one hit, so then... NoriP: Yes Ai: That's one of the main points of my strategy.. Ai: This! NoriP: Yes Ai: I'll use the ability that takes 3 turns to activate.. Ai: And then... Ai: While making use of the fact that I'm in advantage... Ai: If I'm able to use Clarice-chan's ability to improve the stats... Ai: I can, well... Ai: Finish easily... Ai: Finish my enemies easily.. NoriP: I didn't expect any less from the master Ai: \"Yes\" NoriP: You have a surprising fighting system, you've gotten used to it, right? Ai: That's right, I've been studying a lot NoriP: You've been playing a lot, haven't you? Ai: Yes! I worked hard.. Ai: Finally I reached... Ai: Finally I reached it.. NoriP: Lucrecia? Ai: Lucrecia.. Ai: Lu... Ai: Listen, NoriP-san NoriP: Yes Ai: Please repeat \"Lucrecia\" five times.. NoriP: Lucrecia, Lucrecia, Lucrecia, Lucrecia, Lucrecia.. Ai: Ah.. NoriP: Try it yourself Ai: Lucrecia, Lucrecia, Lucrecia, Lucrecia, Lucrecia, Lucrecia.. Ai: Did I say it? *laughs* NoriP: You've been at the limit.. Ai: At the limit! *inhales* Ai: Aaaah! NoriP: Please concentrate! Ai: Ah! Ah! Ah, please look at this! NoriP: Oh! Ai: I already defeated one! NoriP: Without realizing it, you've already... Ai: That's right! Ai: Ah! Ai: Ah! Ai: Those attacks that have a counter are terrifying, right? NoriP: They're terrifying, right? Ai: That's right, it's very difficult to calculate the right timing to use the stat improvement skill.. Ai: And this... Ai: Ah, right! Ai: This... Ai: Ah! Right! Ai: I'm glad that the two turns have already passed... Ai: But I wish I could've improve their stats! Ai: It sometimes happens, right? NoriP: It's true.. Ai: That's right NoriP: But I see you're doing well without issues.. Ai: That's right, I'm doing well! Ai: Good! Ai: Good! Good, good! Ai: What do you think of this? NoriP: Well... NoriP: You're doing well Ai: If you compare me with my weak self from before then... NoriP: You've improved a lot, right? Ai: That's right! NoriP: Incredible Ai: Hahaha.. NoriP: You've already completed the first wave, right? Ai: Good! Ai: Don't you think this it'll be really easy? NoriP: It looks like it'll be easy, right? Ai: I haven't lost any HP.. NoriP: Oh.. Ai: Oh.. Ai: No, the boost skill... Ai: For the moment, I'll use it now... NoriP: This part is difficult, right? NoriP: During the second wave, you should... NoriP: Well... NoriP: Accumulate skills in order to use them in the third wave... Ai: That's right, it's true Ai: But, with respect to that... Ai: You know... Ai: Elizabeth-chan... NoriP: Yes! Ai: Well... Ai: Rather than needing to wait... Ai: I can... Ai: I'll use in only one turn... NoriP: Yes Ai: While I wait... Ai: Since I can't use her too much... NoriP: Yes Ai: So then it's easy to use.. NoriP: Oh.. Ai: Oh.. Ai: Oh..? Ai: But the enemy is pretty formidable, right? NoriP: It's very powerful! Right? Ai: That's right Ai: Hehehe.. NoriP: You've gotten a lot stronger yourself, right? Ai: NoriP-san has also called me master.. NoriP: Master! NoriP: Master, can I join your Union? Ai: I suppose I have no other option *laughs* Ai: In return... Ai: You know, right? NoriP: Ah... Ai: Good? NoriP: What... are you talking about? Ai: Well, you know, of my song... Ai: Forming part of Cryptract... NoriP: *laughs* Ai: And also my character appearing.. Ai: Right? NoriP: It's true NoriP: Well, if you can beat the practical test of today... NoriP: And if you successfully complete the questions quiz.. Ai: Well, I already beat the questions quiz, I got them all right.. NoriP: Eh? Ai: Eh? NoriP: You were wrong in all of them! *laughs* Ai: I was wrong in all of them, right? NoriP: You were wrong in all of them! Ai: Wasn't that a dream then? NoriP: Eh? It was a dream? Ai: That's what I think.. NoriP: Do you dream? Ai: No, well, you know, the question about the contract in the game... NoriP: Yes, yes, yes, yes Ai: Well... Ai: I guessed half.. NoriP: You guessed half, right? Ai: Look! Look! Look! NoriP: Oh! NoriP: Keep up the good work until the end! Ai: Look! Ai: This is very easy NoriP: It's very easy, right? Ai: It finally appeared Ai: That appearance with that lightning is... Ai: Ah? It's huge! It looks great Ai: Eh? Ai: It looks great Ai: Eh? Ai: If you're planning to make my character appear... NoriP: Yes Ai: In fact... Ai: What do you think if I think up of a monster too? NoriP: Yes, that sounds like a good idea Ai: With cat ears.. NoriP: With cat ears? Ai: Even though it's actually an A.I NoriP: Although it's actually an A.I Ai: Even though it's an A.I NoriP: In Mamiruton-san's case... Ai: Yes NoriP: Well... NoriP: The players sent us their drawings... Ai: Aaaahhh! NoriP: And well... NoriP: That's how we created Dorimia-chan.. Ai: Ah, I see NoriP: It's cause of that... NoriP: That if you work harder, Ai-chan... NoriP: There exists a possibility that it will happen Ai: Oh, ho, ho... Ai: Ah, but you know, I'd like to take advantage of the opportunity... Ai: For people to be able to participate, right? NoriP: Yes, yes, yes.. Ai: But.. Ai: You know... Ai: I'd like to attempt to do the drawing NoriP: You want to do the drawing? Ai: I want to do the drawing, but... Ai: I could ask everyone to participate by contributing ideas for skills... Ai: And then be able to choose... Ai: Senbutsu? Senbatsu? (Choosing is \"Senbatsu\") Ai: Choose? Ai: That's what I want.. NoriP: You can do it in private Ai: In private? Ai: Eh? Ai: I can use someone else's idea... NoriP: You can use another idea... Ai: And send it as my own... NoriP: And send it as your own Ai: I finished! Ai: Even though it's not my idea.. Ai: How sad! *inhales* Ai: That's very sad.. NoriP: It's very sad, isn't it? Ai: This is... Aaaahh! Wait! Ai: Ah, Eh? Ai: Ah, ah! I can still do it NoriP: Ooohh... NoriP: That was close.. Ai: I can do it, I can do it, that was close.. Ai: Ah! Ah! Ah! I only need to wait one more turn, good job! Ai: Good job! Ai: Here I should... Ai: Eh? What is this? Fog? Fog? NoriP: It looks like it, doesn't it? Ai: Eh? What happens when there's fog? NoriP: If you're interested in knowing its effect, you'll now be able to see it.. NoriP: As you can see... Ai: Ooohh! *Weather (Heavy Fog) effect: Light-based units take less damage* Ai: Eh? Ah, I'm in trouble.. Ai: I'm.. I'm in trouble.. NoriP: You're in trouble, right? Ai: I'm in trouble.. Ai: Ah, to top it off, it immobilized me with electricity! Ai: Even though I was waiting for the necessary turns! Ai: I have to start from scratch again! Ai: It's so unfair.. Ai: And to think only one turn was left! Ai: That's why I was thinking of using Clarice-chan to improve their stats... Ai: Or that's what I wanted to do... Ai: It's unfair.. NoriP: It's unfair Ai: Aaaaugh! Ai: I'm in trouble, I'm in trouble... NoriP: You're in trouble Ai: The danger level is very high.. Ai: I feel like I'm probably in trouble.. NoriP: You're in trouble, right? Ai: I'm really in trouble.. Ai: Eh? Ai: What did you do? *laughs* NoriP: Is it my fault? Ai: Are you not intentionally interfering to avoid me completing the mission?! NoriP: *laughs* I'm not interfering! Ai: After all, I'm in trouble! Ai: Three turns! Ai: Resist! Ai: Noooo! Ai: Listen! Listen! Wait... Ai: Wait, calm down.. Ai: At this time you must breathe deeply.. Ai: *inhale, inhale, exhale*, something like that, right? NoriP: This giant enemy looks difficult.. Ai: It's true.. Ai: I'm in trouble.. Ai: Stop, please! Ai: Eh? Ai: Ah.. Ai: Ah, I'm still alive.. NoriP: Oh, man... Ai: Ah, I died once... Ai: And returned... Ai: Stop it! Ai: Stop it! NoriP: Your friend appeared to help you, right? Ai: My friend appeared! Ai: That's the character... Ai: That I always wanted to have! Ai: Ah! Ai: Eh? NoriP: Ah! Ai: Ah.. Ai: That's right, times like these is when the power is activated... Ai: That revives you the first time you die.. Ai: Hey! Ai: I want to obtain Tiana-chan! Ai: That attack is great Ai: I want to have her.. Ai: I want to have Tiana-chan.. NoriP: *laughs* Ai: Ah, if you get Tiana-chan... Ai: I could end this much more easily.. NoriP: I won't gift it to you Ai: Of course, when will the next character appear? NoriP: The next.. well, yes... NoriP: If you try harder Ai-chan, then... Ai: If I try hard, will you gift it to me? NoriP: Well, our intention is to launch a new character.. NoriP: If you try hard Ai-chan, maybe some day we'll gift it to you.. Ai: I see! Ai: What's the next major update? NoriP: Well, it's a secret.. Ai: Mmm? Ai: Ah, I'm in trouble.. Ai: Eh? NoriP: I think this is impossible now.. Ai: I'm in trouble! NoriP: *laughs* Ai: What does this mean? NoriP: This is... NoriP: Useless, right? NoriP: Aren't you in trouble? Ai: That's not true.. NoriP: What... what do you plan to do? You still want to continue? NoriP: Ah, but you can still do it! Ai: It's true, I can do it Ai: I can do it, right? Ai: Ah.. Ai: They don't give me time to make my attack! NoriP: With this, now... Ai: NOOOO! Ai: Oooh... it's the end now.. Ai: Ah, ah... how did this happen? NoriP: There's no more hope.. Ai: There's no more hope, right? NoriP: *laughs* Ai: You can't... you can't do something about this fog? Ai: Aooohhhh! NoriP: It's very difficult, right? Ai: How can this be..? Ai: I'm really in trouble! Ai: I'm in trouble! Ai: I'm about to cry.. Ai: I can't defeat anyone.. Ai: Go for it! Ai: Go for it! *inhales* Ai: Go for iiit! Ai: I have no choice but to despair.. Ai: Why.. Ai: Can't I defeat them? Ai: Why can't I defeat them? NoriP: You don't have energy to try harder, right? Ai: I don't have enough energy! Ai: Maybe those enemies can recover? Ai: Wait a moment! Ai: Let's calm down.. Ai: Let's calm down.. Ai: Eiyaa! NoriP: Now... NoriP: Only your character friend is left.. Ai: Ah! Ai: Ah! Ai: I knew it! Ai: Eh? Did I die? Ai: They didn't die, right? NoriP: No, no, no.. NoriP: Wh.. NoriP: You just died there right, you just used a continue.. Eh!? Ai: What are you talking about? Ai: Were you really watching? NoriP: I was really watching! Ai: Balloon eyes can't see after all! NoriP: *laughs* Don't blame it all on the balloon! Ai: No, I wasn't.. NoriP: Balloons from all over the world... Ai: Ah! Ah! This will soon be.. Ai: My Youtuber career... Soon I.. Ai: This is like something that was already seen! Ai: Give me a break, give me a break Ah! Ai: The two-turn attack just came.. NoriP: Oh! Ai: Nothing has changed... eh? Ai: It's so hard! Ai: Eh!? Ai: Please do your best! NoriP: This actually has an order in which you should defeat your ennemies... Ai: Ah! Ai: Right! Starting from the underlings.. NoriP: Yes Ai: I was really out of order.. *laughs* NoriP: You tried to do the stronger one first.. Ai: Right, right, I'm going to do it in the right order.. NoriP: Then please keep on going.. NoriP: Well, if you lose with this, it would be terrible! Ai: Yeah, that's right! Ai: After all I've tossed, only a fool would lose NoriP: That's why you're going to get passed NoriP: The uppers, you won't be made a Cryptract upper.. Ai: Please! Ai: Don't push me! Ai: Ah, ah.. Ai: His one attack is too much! Ai: Too much! Ai: Good, good, good! Ai: Aaaah... Ai: Aaah... Ai: Eh? Ai: Aha... Ai: Ah!? Ai: Aaaaah!? Ai: It's so strong! Ai: Eh? Ai: But, with this... Ai: Eh? Ai: What? Ai: Wait, isn't it becoming stronger...? Ai: Wait a moment! Ai: Okay! Ai: Why do you do this!? NoriP: Eh? NoriP: We can't really see a lot with the fog.. Ai: That's right.. Ai: Eh, what's written there? Win? NoriP: *laughs* Win's not written there, no.. Ai: Hm? Ai: Ah? NoriP: Ah? Ai: Yeah, the fog is really troubling.. Ai: We couldn't understand what was going on there.. NoriP: Ai-chan, wai-.. NoriP: Cont... Conti... did you just used a continue? Ai: No, no continue! Nori: No continue? Ai: The fog is just too big.. Ai: The fog.. NoriP: That's sly.. Ai: It's mostly the fog's fault.. NoriP: That aside.. Ai: Mostly the fog.. NoriP: Let's beat him! Ai: Let's do that! NoriP: Even if you used a continue, let's defeat him! Ai: HEY, YOU DON'T HAVE TO SAY I USED A CONTINUE! Ai: YOU DON'T HAVE TO SAY IT! NoriP: *laughs* Well, you'll get found out, so.. Ai: If you don't say it, good kids won't understand it! *laughs* Ai: They don't understand! NoriP: Of course Ai: Yes! Ai: Even if it's a lie, just keep lying.. NoriP: It becomes real! Ai: How was it called again? That's it! Ai: Ah! Ha! Please don't paralyze me! Ai: Aaah! Ai: Elizabeth-chan! Ai: No more.. Ai:  You know.. Ai: It's as if.. Ai: If I wait, I can use very strong attacks, but... Ai: This paralysis... Ai: It makes them go \"uzaza\".. Ai: Ah, the fog is even bigger again.. Ai: This makes me really upset! Ai: Can't anything be done about it? NoriP: If you're paralyzed.. Ai: Yes.. NoriP: You can't use skills like that, so.. Ai: Aaah! Ai: So, after all, the paralysis is... Ai: Better used on those who have skills? Ai: That's better.. Ai: I see.. Ai: Ah! Ai: This is nice! The timing is great! Ai: Yoi! Ai: Oh? NoriP: Oh? Ai: Have mercy! Ai: Looks like... the fog will prevent us to see again.. *laughs* Ai: Nice Ai: Do it more! Ai: It's like, if you watch anime.. Ai: Sometimes... Ai: There's this kind of cloud or light, you know.. NoriP: Yes.. yes.. NoriP: Yes Ai: I think that they're really disturbing! Ai: But now, they're pretty good! Ai: Aaaah, ha! Ai: I can do it, with this! NoriP: You can still do it! Ai: Gooood! Ai: Ahh, after all, it's really strong! Ai: What do you think? NoriP: A good thing happened! Ai: Without a continue, you know! NoriP: That was incredible! Ai: Incredible! NoriP: You won with 2 continues! Ai: AGAIN!? NoriP: *laughs* Ai: You don't need to say those kind of things! NoriP: I'm sorry, I'm sorry! Ai: Your superiors didn't teach you about this!? NoriP: I'm sorry, I'm sorry Ai: Yes NoriP: That's right! NoriP: No continue.. Ai:  No con.. oh, this is cute! Eh? Ai: Foxes are cute! NoriP: You got something.. Ai: It's cute, pretty.. Ai: Just now... Ai: It's so cute! Nori: That's a Genju.. Ai: It's hands are like \"BASCON!\" Ai: It's so cute! NoriP: Well, you got it as a reward.. Ai: Yes NoriP: Isn't it worth it? Ai: Pretty much.. Ai: How was it? NoriP: Well, you lost so... Ai: Eh!? Ai: Lost? It was a win! NoriP: No, well, you know... NoriP: Compared to when you started, you've really improved Ai: That's right! NoriP: At first, you were like... NoriP: You could only tap on it.. Ai: Yes, yes, yes.. NoriP: But now, you know the skill specialities, timing and all that NoriP: Fighting while learning Genju's attributes.. Ai: That's right! Nori: I think you've become pretty good Ai: But, it's really where you should focus on Ai: You're really sharp! *laughs* Ai: It was without meaning to NoriP: It was on purpose, on purpose Ai: It was without meaning to! Ai: How was it? NoriP: No... NoriP: Hmm... NoriP: There's still a lot of things that I would like to see... Ai: There's still some left!? NoriP: Until now, we did a lot of quizzes... NoriP: Or other tests to see your abilities.. NoriP: Actually, like... NoriP: Showing what you've learnt, your results.. NoriP: But not just that, luck as well.. NoriP: I would like to see, like summonings! Ai: It's part of your strength.. Ai: Oh?! NoriP: We're going to watch that? Ai: Oh, this... Ai: If I draw outside of videos, I've had really bad luck.. NoriP: Ah, is that so? Ai: But when I'm recording, my luck is really good.. NoriP: Isn't that a characteristic of a star? NoriP: You really have some lucky ones Ai: Yes, I really do Ai: Right now.. Ai: The chance boost is on Maidin-chan and Iris-chan.. Ai: My targets are.. Ai: This, Iris-chan.. Ai: Semuhaza-chan? Ai: Semuhaza-san? Ai: Hm? Ai: Semuha...za...-chan? NoriP: Yes.. Ai: Then.. Ai: I already have Meiko-chan and Dorothy-chan too.. NoriP: Yes Ai: This is cute, she has some dolls! NoriP: She's cute and she's strong! I got her! Ai: Cute! Ai: Why do you have her? NoriP: *laughs* Because she appeared.. NoriP: Why, why you? Ai: Damn directors, you upper dogs NoriP: No, no, no.. Ai: Wan! (Japanese onomatopeia for dogs) Ai: You're an upper balloon NoriP: Yes, I'm a balloon Ai: So, let's do this.. NoriP: Yes Ai: Come out! Ai: Girls! Ai: I like you, I love you! Ai: \"Love you\"! Ai: Ah... Ai: This looks a bit... NoriP: You can't really be sure, but... NoriP: Ah... ... Ai: AAAH!? NoriP: Oh!? Ai: I really got lucky! Ai: Hey everyone, did you think I had failed? I really got this! Ai: She's so cute! Ai: Those stuffed toys around her are so cute! NoriP: Twister! Ai: Are they some kind of stuffed toys? NoriP: Dorothy... Ai: She's so cute! NoriP: Just as you called it Ai: Super cute! Ai: Dorothy is from a fairy tale? Right? NoriP: Woah, incredible, you really have some luck! Ai: Looks like I really have some good luck! NoriP: This is really great, isn't it? Ai: Ohoho! Ai: Eh!? Ai: Amazing! NoriP: Great luck! Ai: What do you think? Ai: Luck is the only thing I have! NoriP: *laughs* Ai: Only luck, only this! NoriP: Well, luck is all what you need Ai: Yaaay! Ai: Eh? NoriP: Let's team her up with your old team.. Ai: Dorothy.. Ai: Eh? Oh, I found her.. Ai: She's really cute! Ai: Eh? Ai: This... Ai: I mean, Dorothy-chan herself is cute too, but.. NoriP: Yes! Ai: Those two things around her are so cute! NoriP: She attacks with them.. Ai: Eh!? NoriP: If you tap on her.. Ai: Ah!? Ai: It goes like \"Shun\"! NoriP: Yes Ai: Ah, so cute! Ai: What about this little one? Ai: This one's already attacking.. Ai: The other one protects her? Ai: Standby, alright, she's a decoration NoriP: She's on standby.. Ai: This girl so cute, like a mascot.. NoriP: *laughs* Ai: Ah... but... Ai: If I make a character.. Ai: She will be like, I always wanted to be like this kind of girl.. Ai: A girl with wings, a barrier, and stuffed toys! NoriP: Creating a character... NoriP: You really do want to make one.. Ai: Yes! NoriP: I see.. Ai: I'll make one by myself and send it.. *laughs* Ai: With a video.. Ai: I'll create it and send it! Ai: And, if it's refused, I'm going to cry Ai: Even so, I can't get her, right? Ai: Eh... this girl can... Ai: Create a shield for all allies for 3x damage... Ai: Ah! She can make a barrier, nice! Ai: Also.. Ai: It can hit 25 to 30 times, it's nice! Ai: What's the silence effect? Ai: It's when they can't do anything right? NoriP: Yes Ai: Oh! (Silence effect: Skills can't be used) Ai: That earlier one, it was floating.. NoriP: Yes, that was.. Ai: If it is silenced, Reju... revive can't be used.. NoriP: Skill... skill... yes. NoriP: Yes, you can't use skills.. Ai: Oh! Perfect! Ai: Good timing! NoriP: Yeah Ai: Nice! NoriP: Very powerful... Ai: I really am.. Ai: Furthermore.. Ai: She's a Light type which I don't really have a lot.. Ai: Yaah.. Ai: So? I'm really powerful, aren't I? NoriP: Cryptract Quiz! Ai: Oh!? NoriP: All answers were correct NoriP: Physical test, was a big fail Ai: Physical test, was a big success! NoriP: Eh? Ai: Eh? NoriP: But you used continues, didn't you? Ai: I only repeated what you've said.. NoriP: Oh really? Ai: Yes, yes, yes! NoriP: So.. NoriP: Physical test.. NoriP: Was a big failure.. Ai: Was a big success.. NoriP: Oh whatever... NoriP: But you were really strong with the summons! Ai: Great! Ai: If the end is good, everything is fine! NoriP: So your outcome is.. Ai: Oh! NoriP: Still in Review! Ai: Ah!? Here it comes! Ai: Review... that's a really handy word.. NoriP: Put it on review, NoriP doesn't really have the power.. Ai: Oh, so who does...? Ai: Please bring someone who has authority! NoriP: Yes... well, it's a bit... NoriP: Hmmm.... NoriP: NoriP is really powerless.. Ai: Someone who has the power! NoriP: This is useless, really Ai: Eh? NoriP: Asking a review for NoriP is useless Ai: Next time, bring someone who can make a real review.. NoriP: Yes, yes, yes... Ai: You know, to make it better.. Ai: Better and better.. Ai: Let's make it better.. NoriP: I'm doing it.. Ai: Great! NoriP: It's just that... NoriP: Unique? NoriP: I'll tell my superiors, I definitely want to letthem know everything you've done for Cryptract Ai: Yes, yes.. oh.. yes, yes NoriP: So then.. NoriP: If you keep working hard.. NoriP: That kind of thing can happen too.. Ai: Oh! I see! NoriP: Yes! Ai: So I just need to keep making these kind of videos? Ai: Well, I'm already doing it, I'm already doing it.. NoriP: You're already doing it, right? Ai: They're done, right? NoriP: They've been done, yeah Ai: Then.. AI: Additionally, I'm thinking about a supportive song! Ai: You know, I kind of want to make one, what do you think? NoriP: You will create a song for Cryptract? Ai: Yes, just for Cryptract! NoriP: That would be appreciated! Ai: Oh? Ai: Right? Isn't it!? NoriP: Yes, yes Ai: I will, myself, compose this supportive song.. NoriP: That sounds nice, I'm very happy for your support Ai: Yes! Yes! NoriP: It makes me quite curious.. Ai: Yes it is, count on me! NoriP: Yes, yes, yes, I want your support NoriP: Then I'll report about this too Ai: Yes! Ai: With this.. it's perfect NoriP: Those uppers.. Ai: It feels like \"Ga, ha, ha\"! NoriP: *laughs* It really does! Ai: Yes, thank you very much for today! NoriP: Thank you very much! Ai: Well, next time..

There's a lot of them aren't there? Hmmmm This stuffed animal is cute, isn't it? Which one should we do? This glove thing is cute isn't it? \"Plush Glove\" \"Kid's size... kid's size...\" I see... Ah! There's a figure here too! Do you think I could have my own stuff on here someday? Which one would be good? You know... I think an easy one would be best. A Snoopy shoulder bag! That sounds nice... Ah, food would be good right?! Choco...Baby...Circle...Box... Ah, I see... ...this is how it looks like. I don't know if I want to use my first try on this... This is taking more effort than I thought it would. It really is. These three tries... I don't want to waste them, you know? Pizza Pan Cushion! Couldn't this trick someone? Ah, I see... this button lets me change the angle Oh, I think I can get this. Ah, well... I'm going to look a little more, can't be too naive. If you don't think thought through, you might regret later. Oh, that looks delicious! How do you get this? This is kind of, well... not very kind. Aren't there anything that I can get in one try? Seems like there are no... Oh! A rice cooker for one! Steamy... rice... (lol) Pretty good, huh? There are more and more people living alone, after all. Let's try this! Without further ado...

There won't be any problems if I upload video where I didn't succeed right? If I delete this app, can I play it agai... Well, my skill might be not enough or maybe I haven't study enough. I'll definitely get it next time! Everyone! If you like to play Paying attention to the range for the claw could be a good idea It seems like you are able to spectate other people play Observe other people play \"This should be about here\" like that. Might have a better result Maybe next time... I'd challenge it again! Do you have any crane game tips? \"It should be like this\" kinda If you have some advice, please, teach Kizuna Ai!

While climbing a snowy mountain alone, you've come across a Yeti!) This kind of situation is unreal, isn't it? After all, Yetis don't even exist.. Do you think this is an occult problem? Why did the Random Word Generator make this crappy subject? Ah... Right, so next up I'll choose 3 items.. Let's do it at once.... Jaka, jaka, jan! Broccoli, good.. Bamboo.. Eraser Ok, this crisis is impossible to avoid with these items.. Ah... I was lying, I was lying.. Understood, I'll do it with those items... So... let's go... So first, we ran into a yeti.. Waaaaaii! Then.. I'll give him broccoli.. Then the bamboo as well.. Then, I'll use eraser to wipe the Yeti's head.. And he'll be happy! Good, crisis has been avoided! Ok, so let's keep go... No, I quit, I quit.. You know, I'm tired... It's not fun anymore... Well, I won't do anything else.. I'll die I'll really die from loneliness... Should I? Even if I said I'll die.. Am I even alive? It happens right? This kind of time.. You know, normally? Like an illness? I don't really know how to explain but I just don't have any motivation.. Something like that, you know.. Ah...you know, like what's an A.I? Like, who am I? What's Kizuna Ai? This is only a shell, right? If this didn't exist.. I'd be transparent, after all, there's really nothing.. Anyway, my model was shared so anyone can do this.. Even if it isn't me, isn't it fine? You know, like anyone from anywhere.. Right? Saying \"Hello everyone, I'm Kizuna Ai\" They can just do it, right? Isn't it good? Even if it's not me? Right? Ah, I'm done.. I'm really done...

Ehm... If you'd like it It doesn't have to be forced Really, in the end, only if you'd like to I thought that maybe one of you viewers could maybe give me the favor of making one~ Couldn't you do this request? No, truly, you don't need to force yourself It's fine if it's just for people who have the free time For this broken down A.I... Can you pitch in and help!!? *Babam* If you think like that From the softness of your heart... If there are any such people, please!! What kind of song would be good for the ending? The length should be 10 seconds, the tempo should be good and have a cute feeling And, somehow, if you listen to it once... A song that will get stuck in your head and would make you hum, it would be good Well, I don't ask you to force yourself to do it I'm mostly just asking you to do it like I did it, however Please!!

In this occasion, it\u2019ll be about that which I like so much I\u2019ll do many delusions with the following plan: \"I\u2019ll do delusions of this and that by my account with Keyakizaka46\" Having said that... ...I\u2019ll present the Draft of Keyakizaka46 that I usually do every night! (Draft: Sports competition in which professional teams select players from a pool of players) A draft of Keyakizaka 46 implies that... ...Travelling... ...Eating! ...They\u2019re delusions that I imagine in a lot of different situations It's a game in which I choose, like as if it was a draft, to one of the members of Keyakizaka46, depending on who I want to spend time with in that situation Since it's a delusion... I can choose at my whim, right? I normally do these kinds of things alone Yes, you, there! Don\u2019t move away, please! Yes? First off, the draft to go together to a deserted island! The member that wants to choose ... (Phrase used to announce the players chosen by the teams) ...The Virtual YouTuber Kizuna AI during the first round Oda Nana! Man, it took me some to decide I\u2019m sure that Oda Nana wouldn't stop smiling even in a deserted island! And I'm sure that she would protect me with her maternal instinct!! I think she would give me courage Even though I would be worried, saying: \u201cWhat should we do? We are in a deserted island, it could be that we could never return\" \"Don\u2019t worry, hahahaha!\" Well, I think that with her coming along,everything will be happier, right? And... supposing... Oda Nana is definitely a woman If she were secretly crying In that moment...! ...It\u2019d be \"Kizuna AI man\u201d\u2019s turn! I\u2019d say to her: \"Are you okay? Don\u2019t worry, Oda Nana\" \"I\u2019ll protect you! Yee?\" And with that, I\u2019d turn the situation around in an instant! I'm sure that even she would fall in love with me Right? And the other girl who I was hesitant on is... Nagahama Neru-chan Neru-chan is a savage girl, so then... ...Well, she could definitely survive even in a deserted island, right? In a deserted island... \u2026 It\u2019s true, even though I\u2019d like to be Neru and Oda Nana the most In a deserted island... \u2026But I worry how I\u2019d spend the days together with Oda Nana But just like I said before... ...Well, essentially Oda Nana would protect me, but... ...From time to time, I\u2019d continue to protect her It's like we wouldn't have any worries in the deserted island, but instead we\u2019d be happy We could live an entire life together!! Next up...! \"The draft for going together after school  with our school uniforms to Sweet Paradise!\" (Sweet Paradise = Cake shop) Hypothetically speaking, it would be who would I like to go to the same high school together with After all, it's a delusion, right? Everyone, make sure to follow along with me!! The member that wants to choose... ...The Virtual YouTuber Kizuna AI during the first round Man, this... ...Is now... ...Decided Moriya Akane-chan! Akanen! Man... If we're talking about Akanen... ...Lately in Keyakizaka... \u2026The episode in the selection of members  of USJ was made, right? But since the beginning... I cried, thinking: \"I wasn\u2019t chosen either\", even though I really left an adorable impression, but... Definitely...! ...Since we\u2019d be going together after school with our school uniforms... ...So then I should definitely go with my favorite member, right? Together with Akanen, we\u2019d be asking: \"Eh? Which do you want to eat? Which do you want to eat?\" \"Ah! I will also eat that one then\" And well, since it's about Sweets Paradise, you can eat whatever you want with a fixed price \"Eh? Ah, I also want to try a bite, aaaahh!\" We'd be doing something like that It'd be something like that Next up! The draft for renting a small car in a rental auto store and go for a one night two days trip to a hot spring The member that wants to choose... ...The YouTuber Virtual Kizuna AI during the first round Sugai Habu Shida! Yes When you reach my level... ...You can spend an entire night deluding, right? In this occasion... \u2026 I chose three people Well, first... ...Let\u2019s see... Habu-chan and Sugai-chan... ...In a program, well... to tell you the truth, they get along really well, so then... ...They were together in a deserted island, right? And well, unexpectedly... how do I say it... in fact, they seem like complete opposites... Shida-chan and Sugai-chan... ...They get along well, so then... ...If it were those three, well... ...It\u2019s not a usual combination for the programs, but... \u2026 I thought it'd be fun, so then... Mona, well, definitely... well... (Mona is Shida\u2019s nickname) \u2026 She\u2019d do some strange movement and she\u2019d laugh She'd laugh, saying \"Weeeei!\" And well Habu-chan and Sugai-chan In fact they're both calm so they\u2019d have fun together And well, definitely... I'd be surrounded in female elegance... Would it\u2019d be like a harem?? Man, well\u2026 ...Each one of them has a different personality... ...Well, I'm sure that everyone would follow me Certainly, certainly, I think we\u2019ll be spending such a happy time together Maybe... ...they will pull me by the arms, saying: \"Eh? AI-chan was supposed to take a bath with me\" They\u2019d get me in trouble A.I.Channel \u2665 Man! I got really excited! Right? I'll say a lot more delusions! The next theme will be... \"Year 20XX, a mysterious asteroid is approaching Earth!\" \"To to avoid the collision, they travel in a new kind of rocket to outer space!\" \"Officer Commander Kizuna AI is entrusted with the destiny of all humanity!\" \"And she has to choose 14 members from the group Keyakizaka46 to do this life or death mission!\" \"Who will she choose...!?\"", "Hello everyone! Virtual Youtuber Kizuna Ai here! Everyone, do you know what happened January this year? That's right! My account was banned! Well... Whatever happened was still a good memory... Even though I was innocent at that time! \"DAMN YOU, YOUTUBE!!!!\" I also thought about stuff like that Honestly However, as an appreciation for my hard work Kizuna Ai has... Started a Youtube sponsorship!! Yay~~ I did it! Sponsorship! SPONSORSHIP! \u266a\u3000Sponsorship\u3000\u266a Sponsorship SPONSOOOOOOOOORSHIP! Sponsorshiiip Sponsorship The one who got picked was Kizuna Ai Thank you very much! Thank you very much! Hello everyone, how are you doing? Little head great wit *Japanese proverb* Kizuna Ai A little bit earlier when Kizuna Ai-san was making a fuss about her sponsorship... It was a bit hard to understand everything all at once right? So that's why today's theme will be.... Youtube Sponsorship Beta mode In a few words, Sponsorship is... ...a paid content system by YouTube Every month, when paying a fixed amount you receive a custom badge, access to sponsor only posts. Emoji, sponsor only chat and other benefits To sponsor me... First, go to the top page and either click or tap \"sponsor\" Follow the instructions in the screen and input your pay method Either click or tap \"buy\" Once the purchase is completed, a welcome message will be displayed And that is it for How to apply as a sponsor Now, we will talk about some warnings Currently, the sponsorship is in beta mode There may be problems with functionality or other unexpected problems Also, because it is in beta... There are many channels where this feature cannot be used The monthly fee is also a currently fixed amount, but... It\u2019s possible for the fee to change at the final release \"Devices where this can be used\" Only a computer or an Android device can be used In the event of iOS... There are some functions allowed But not all basic functions will be usable That\u2019s it We\u2019re sorry for the inconvenience We kindly ask for your understanding as it is still in beta Now, let's hear from Kizuna Ai-san About the original benefits of sponsoring A.I.Channel Let's hear her story Go ahead! Yep! Definitely! First of all, bloopers... I\u2019ve done it in many videos But it's embarrassing.... Right? But I'll show them! (You're a super A.I, but you make bloopers) Next, rejected video uploads! Well\u2026 Clearly I don't have any rejected videos, but... I gathered the videos that weren't that high in quality So it is possible it may come up Well, this is also embarrassing but... I'll show it! And, and! Behind the scenes of videos! Those few minute videos to just past 10 minute ones Definitely had some dramas when recording! I will also show the behind scenes! (So you can expect to see me being more useless than in my videos) What? (So you can expect to see me being more useless than in my videos) Online game recording announcements If timing allows it and we meet online It may be possible to join in the recording And finally, sponsor-only comment replies! I will enjoy communicating with everyone! Well... * (Thank you, lastly, would you like to say a message to all your viewers?)* \"Because sponsorship just started\" * (Thank you, lastly, would you like to say a message to all your viewers?)* \"Won't A.I.Channel change then?\" * (Thank you, lastly, would you like to say a message to all your viewers?)* I think there may be some people who are thinking along the lines of that * (Thank you, lastly, would you like to say a message to all your viewers?)* But A.I.Channel won't change! Same as before, five uploads a week! And adding A.I.Games videos I'll be uploading everyday! Sponsoring costs money Even though there are probably various opinions on this Because I've been doing my best till today... Because everyone has been supporting me I was able to get this chance I want to do even better! I'll be happy if everyone will watch over me with caring eyes That's it! And this was Kizuna Ai! \"About Youtube Sponsorship beta mode\" Were we able to convey the message along to everyone? Until next time with the latest A.I. news And finally, some last words before leaving At long last, we have finally met *Japanese proverb* Let's meet again until then! Bye!", "Hello everyone!

This was Virtual Youtuber Kizuna Ai! See you later!", "Hi there! Virtual Youtuber, Kizuna Ai here. I've often thought about making an original song, and this so I found this app! Tada! While using this app to make a song, I'm going to play with the various things it can do. Well, this app, With all it's various inputs... It's all copyright free, and you can easily make a completely original song! I think it's an excellent app. And so, let's get started! First... Cinema! Movie-like songs. And? I can't read English. This'll do! \u300c\uff25\uff30\uff29\uff23\u3000\uff24\uff32\uff29\uff36\uff29\uff2e\uff27\u300d Ok! Is 5 minutes-ish okay? That's all? That's all I have to do? Ah! It's done! And... play. This song is like... [What situation suits this song?] like you've been found, [What situation suits this song?] and you've nearly beaten an enemy, [What situation suits this song?] but that enemy's boss is strong, [What situation suits this song?] and you can't call for help, [What situation suits this song?] like, \"what do I do?\" [What situation suits this song?] Like your friends are dying one by one [What situation suits this song?] That kind of situation. [What situation suits this song?] Let's do it. Hey, Michael, are you ok? Hey, Michael! Michael! What's the situation? Michael! If you're alive, respond! Please, respond! Michael! I'm sorry... It looks like I'm done for. The golden and silver pine cones... they found out about them... Michael! MICHAELLLL!!! Like that. It really made that? That song didn't exist before?

La, la, la... Ah, looks like it's done. From despair to \u300cHAPPY\u300d Let's play it. That's definitely happy. Kind of noisy. This is hard. [What situation suits this song?] When would this play? [What situation suits this song?] Hmm... [What situation suits this song?] It kind of sounds like a surfing song. [What situation suits this song?] And so, let's surf! I'm surfing! Riding the waves! The weather is so nice today! I'm so cool! I think I see some of my fangirls over there. Feels good. Ah, Michael, you're so cool! Look over here! Wave to me! *fangirls out* Fine, I guess. The kittens... I guess I'll blow them a kiss. Like that. Huh, that's wrong? Well, even I have a feeling it's wrong so... Let's do one more. Next is... 90's pop! I can't read this English... Bro... ding? Ok. I need to study. Let's try it. What kind of music is this? Let's see. I'm suddenly getting really sleepy... This song is... A 'meeting with your lover to talk about breaking up' kind of song, isn't it. Like, they're involved with an affair... and, it's been kept hidden So wanting to speak honestly, the couple meet to talk about breaking up. Let's do it! Tiffany, the truth is... I have a wife and child. So...  It's over. I can't see you anymore. I'm sorry. John! I don't care! I love you! Even if I'm second, or third to you. So, Can you still love me? We can still see each other? Hearing that makes me happy, but I'm sorry. Really, I can't betray my cute baby and honey. You've already betrayed them! It's too late! Even if you could go back, it's pointless! You know me, I'm gonna speak out to someone! Everything we've talked about doing, will be sent to your wife With tears flowing, all of your effort will be washed away into the sea! Is that really okay? Not only am I hurt, but your wife will find out what you did. You'll receive judgement from society But you'd still cast me aside? Is that ok?!? That - uh, but! Even so, my baby and honey are important to me! Don't lie! Just a week ago, You said I was the thing that mattered most to you! Didn't you buy me an apartment? Uh, well, uh People are looking. Let's go somewhere else around here. Let's calm down. Let's go to that restaurant over there, and talk calmly. [THIS IS BAD] Like that! You see people like that a lot! So for the end, let's do an ending song. So, let's use Amper Music to make an ending-like song. Amper-chan, I'll leave it to you! Everyone... It's time for us to say farewell... I... Kizuna Ai... I am NOT GOING TO RETIRE! Too heavy! Way too heavy. It's like a real ending. My real end! Well then, Amper Music, did you hear that? Then, let's give it another go! I'm not sure I like this.

It\u2019s true that as long as there is a screen, I can appear anywhere That means that I can connect with all the beings of the universe! But... How will I be able to communicate with them? Ah, hi!

Eehhhh? ...It\u2019s floating Eh? Let me... Let me down! Let me doooown! There's more at the end!", "Hello everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai here! If you\u2019re wondering what we're doing today... De-den! I'd like to change the logo for A.I. Games! I've been thinking about it for a while now.. It's a lot like A.I. Channel So I was thinking I\u2019d like it just a bit more like, \"This is A.I. Games!\" I thought it'd be good to make it more recognisable And it\u2019s cause of that, that this time.. I\u2019ll use sites that let you make original logos.. To make a new logo for A.I. Games! Well then, in that case, let's go! First is this! \u201cLogaster\u201d! On this website... You can easily... make logos! Isn't this neat, right? Not only that.. You can make original logos, so then.. I'd like to make one right now! Teiyaa! \"Logo Creation Wizard\" \"Company name\" Ooohh! Sounds great, right? Even though it\u2019s not about a company.. \"A.I. Games\" \"Business type\" \"Business type\"... \"Internet\"! \"Internet\", \"Fine arts\", \u201cFashion\u201d... \"Entertainment\" Definitely, I'm more of an entertainer, right? So I should choose \"Entertainment\", right? Hoi~! Oooooooh.. There's quite a lot, aren't there? This one's sort of like Windows, right? \"Deeeeen~\", something like that.. Wasn\u2019t it something like \"Deeen\"? I definitely want something... That\u2019s simple but striking.. I\u2019d like one that draws attention.. Well... Which one\u2019s better? I'd like one that is game related and that it\u2019s adorable.. But that it\u2019s simple... Ah, ah... This logo that has a puzzle can be a good candidate, right? And also... And also... There\u2019s so many that it makes me doubt.. Ah! Ah! This logo is for video games! It\u2019s a logo for video games! Although I\u2019d like something a bit more... Something more simple, more \"zen\", \"zen\".. Aaaahh! This! This is close I\u2019d definitely like that \"A.I.\" to be in uppercase letters.. I wonder if I can modify this in some way.. Ah! This! I like it The given ones too... It could be... There\u2019s really a lot! There\u2019s so many! Someone save me! There\u2019s so many that I like that I can\u2019t decide.. Maybe I should choose the puzzle one? Where.. ..Was it? I found the puzzle one! Ah! Here, you can edit.. I see Ooohh! Ah! You can also change the design, right? I see.. I see.. In this case... Eh? And later... Ah, you can... Edit the text.. Can you also edit the icon? Ah! It can be changed! I see Ooohh.. I see.. Aaahh.. I can also change the text font No, I prefer the one before! Eh? I prefer the one before! Eh? \"Restart\" Oh, good, good The color! \"More colors\" Let\u2019s choose more colors... Well, I think it\u2019d have something light blue... Can you understand what it feels to do something so difficult? How it feels? Isn\u2019t it good like this? \"Simple is best\" Ah, best to leave it like that That\u2019s good, right? Yes, yes The simpler... The better! Good! And now, \"Save\"! Cha, chan! I finished! The logo for \"A.I.Games\"! Candidate #1! Next up is this! \u201cLogojoy\u201d! In this case.. You can create a logo... Just by entering a company name! In that case, let\u2019s go! \"A.I. Games\" \"Pick... 5 or... more... logos... you... like..\" This means \"Please choose 5 logos of your liking\", right? I see.. Eh... which one should I choose? Definitely if it's too cute.. In face, it could prove to be too unpleasant to use... Maybe something like this.. Ah but, this one's looks related to games, it seems good.. With that case, this is the first one And now which ones should I choose?. Eh, which ones should I pick? This and.. this and... Honey! This and.. this and... Eh, which should...? I\u2019ll follow my instinct! Maybe this one? One more.. This.. Hey! The color will be.. Let's see... Maybe this one? I\u2019d like a refreshing feel to it.. Without any \"Slogan\"! Three! (Find and choose 3 symbols) I should just pick something, right? I\u2019ll definitely choose \"Games\" \"Games\" This one's pretty good, isn't it? It\u2019s kinda cute.. This one's slightly thicker, hmmm.. Okay, the thin one! This and... Ah! This one's kinda cute.. Ah! My... this... Ah! I wonder if there\u2019s not... Something like my sprout shaped headband... Hmmmmmm.. If I had to choose... I\u2019d definitely like it to have something round.. Hmmm.. Let's see.... Ah, there\u2019s nothing that has a round shape, but.. Not you... this one.. Good.. Teiyaa! Oh! Oooooooh! Ooh! A lot appeared, right? You can view all of them like this, right? Ah, this one's good after all, right? It's a simple logo and related to games Ah, if this was only in uppercase... I wonder if there are any.. There aren't any with uppercase \"A.I.\"! It\u2019s the only thing I can\u2019t change! Ah, this sort of style's pretty nice.. One more.. Ah, but... I can edit this on the next step.. If that's the case.. This one's good, this one.. If only.. If only I can change the letters a bit.. Ah, I can tweak it here, right? Like this.. Hmmm... and next up is... The font... I\u2019d like to change it just a bit.. I\u2019d like something a bit more.. Pop-like and with a sense of cuteness.. Since it's so simple, the font would be.. Better if it were more cute, right? Hmmmm.. There's a lot of them, but.. For something slightly simpler and playful.. This one seems nice to me I\u2019ll definitely choose this one. This, this, this.. For the color... Oh. Oooooooh.. Ah, I can change this too.. It's important, but, definitely.. Since I'm always in this white space.. I thought it would be good to have white as the base, but.. Something like that? And definitely regarding the logo color.. The main channel is pink The game channel is... Some kind of green, right? And this... I think this controller is cute, but.. Well, from far away.. It's hard to recognise and.. I feel like since the lines are too thin so.. The logo symbol too... Is it called \"symbol\"? I'd like to change the symbol.. Oh! There\u2019s a lot, right? Dooo.. do-do do.. I\u2019d definitely like to have something like a controller.. This is adorable! Ah, but this also works.. Ah! How's this? It looks fun and easy to recognise.. Doesn\u2019t this looks good? With this... how is it? Ah! It looks better than expected! Doesn't it look good? I finished! De, deen~! Candidate #2! Well I tried making two of them, but.. They're both pretty good, right? Man, I expected no less of me...well done.. Everyone, please choose one! In this video's comments.. I\u2019ll be making a comment for each logo.. So then click on the \u201cLike\u201d button for the logo you liked The voting period is one week starting from today! The logo that gets the most likes will be.. The one I'd like to use as A.I. Games' new logo! Vote please \u2661 Well then, this was Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai! See you later!

When she sees you in trouble, she asks \"Are you okay?\" and she worried about you\u2026 She starts slow when she meets you, but... ...When she starts to feel something for you She acts cold, she has that personality And also, she has a family comprised of an older brother and a younger one Her younger brother is not honest with his feelings and acts like he doesn't care about his older sister But her older brother... Has an very intimate relationship with Hiya-chan A very intimate relationship She\u2019s a spoiled girl Entry number 2! Kon-chan!

Everyone, what day is 14th of March? Hmm, hmm! That's right! It's White Day, White Day! Everyone received their chocolate from me, right? You did, right? That means you have to return your gift for me. But you don't know the things I want, right? That's why I will tell you about the five things I want the most right now. Because it's White Day, so I'm going to show you my 'white' self! Number five! Furniture! Do you remember? You're sick of this white background, right? I want some furniture. A bed just for display or sleeping on... Decorative shuttlecocks? I want those that you can hang for display. And I want sofa and television! How about that? It's alright if you want to create the models for those and send them to me. And number four! A pet! I want a pet! Like Techi-Techi I drew the other day, is no one making it? It's White Day... So will someone create it for me? Well, I'm basically all by myself. So if I have a pet, after editing and... Get it? The exhaustion after making this kinds of videos? Well, it's going to make me feel better? I appreciate your comments from the human world, but if I have a pet, maybe I'll feel even better? Like that? Now, let's go for the top three you've been waiting for! Number three! Comments. I want your comments! You've been commenting, right? It really cheers me up! Makes me think \"Oh, I'm quite popular.\" Accepting criticism with an open heart. And be happy for the entertained. I'm pretty happy to be connected with all of you! That's why, because it's White Day... I would be happy for those who usually don't comment to do so! Like that... And number two! I want likes. It's there under the video. Like or dislike. I want likes! When I look at some kind of a YouTube ranking, there's also a like-dislike ratio! If I get more likes, maybe more people will watch? Like that? Well, I'm not missing out on you who are already watching. But I want to connect to even more people. So for those who usually... Even for those who clicks on the dislike button, just for today! Maybe you'll click on the Like button this time? No dislikes! Is that a thing? I'm not pretending, I'm really not! Because I said that, now it seems like I'm pretending. But no pretense to this. I think it would be awesome if all of it are likes! Now, let's go for the thing I wish the most! They are fans like you! Rather than calling it a wish, but it's honestly not like I don't need anything. But for the return gift, you fans are enough! From now on, you can watch my videos and check me around on Twitter. I think it's great to be able to connect with lots of people. It would be the greatest return gift if you would stay as my fan! How was this White Ai-chan? I said it myself! If I said it, maybe it won't be 'white' anymore? For rankings, I was thinking if I needed. money, position, or fame. But at least for this White Day, I want to go for it 'white' and clean! But it's true! It's true that I love every single one of you! So please keep supporting me from now on!", "Hello, everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai here! Lately, people have been saying things about me Kizuna Ai, you're kind of like a geezer! How is that possible!? Although I don't know my own gender... At the very least! I don't think I'm a geezer! I mean, look how cute I am So, this time... in order to deny these geezer allegations... I\u2019ll show you all the heights of my girliness! For today... Been a while, but I\u2019ll answer questions from you all What does Ai-chan want the most for now? Hum... Let me think... Since I am virtual... This is a bit hard for me... But if I became human... Maybe a watch from Marc Jacobs!\u266a How does Ai-chan deal with stress? Um... Well... For starters, I don't really have much stress If I did... I\u2019d chat with the stars in the sky... Well, joking aside, I\u2019d go to karaoke with friends, I guess Though, I don\u2019t have any friends... What would you do if you took a long break? Um... if I took a long break I would go with my friends... to play at a beach somewhere in Okinawa And take selfies~ and eat deliciously pretty food And gaze upon the stars at night... while having girls talk\u2661 Something like this? I am envious about Ai-chan's beautiful skin! What comestics do you use? Hum? Really? Is it really that beautiful? I\u2019m so happy! But, I actually... don\u2019t wear any makeup~ Really really! I don\u2019t! Wanna feel it? I-it feels embarrassing to not wear any makeup... in front of this many people But! But! The way to keep beautiful skin... is to sleep and wake up early! Ahhh! This is embarrassing! Ahh... No good! Seriously, no good! I\u2019m sorry! I\u2019m not right for that personality No gooood! I love cute girls! I say bad things\u2026 and shout obscenities!! Though I\u2019m sometimes speak like a geezer... Please don\u2019t abandon me! Please...", "Hello everyone! It's Virtual Creator Kizuna Ai here! For today.. I'll use an app called 'Bitmoji' to make some original stamps.. And carry out an experiment, whereby we'll send the stamps to my beloved Rinna, and see what reaction I'll get! Without further ado, let's begin! Bitmoji is an app that'll allow you to make an original avatar... Which you can insert into chat stamps... First things first, I guess, I'll pick female... Eh?! What should I do... The Bitmoji-style kinda, well it looks cuter, right? *Bitmoji Style/ Bitstrips Style* So, I guess making the avatar comes first, right? Which should I pick, I wonder... Let's go with this! Next comes the color of the skin. I am rather fair-skinned, right? Something like this? As for the hair... Dark brown like black tea. So, like this? Come to think of it, the face looks rather old... As for the hairstyle... How about this one? I guess the closest one would be this? Great! So for the eyebrows... Something along the lines of this? For the color of my eyes.. Is it green, or azure... Something like this? Eh? I guess this will do.. For the nose... Just a little one will do, right? The nose must definitely be a beautiful one... So how about this? For the mouth, something like this is okay? Beneath the eyes?! Ah, like bags under the eyes? Of course not, I don't have bags under my eyes.. Wrinkles won't do either! For the cheek... I guess something like this? \"Eyeshadow\".. While I don't have eyeshadow... I wonder what should I do... Pink? Purplish? This one! Alright, it's decided.. For the lipstick... Do I wear any? Ah, it's light! Light pink it is then Uhuhu... It's so gaudy.. For the headwear, this fluffy thing! (Ai's headband) It's not there... It's really not there... Here's hoping that you'll put that fluffy thing in within one month! For the body type... This is a little... Oh. what's this? It has to be this one alright.. I guess this fits the best... For the bust, they should definitely be big, right? I'm somewhere around the E-cup after all.. Even though that's just fictional... I guess that's it! Clothing selection! Eh, which one should I pick...? Is there nothing that resembles a sailor uniform? Well, since we're doing this as something of a joke, let's go on with it anyway... Oh well, I don't have a choice... Let's just get on with it anyway Let's go with this! Even though you can see the stomach... This? Ah! What about this then? It's summer after all... Alright, it's complete! *Finished Avatar* And so, the avatar I just made.. Will be made into stamps just like this... And after this, it will be simple to set it up to be used with LINE In the settings of the iPhone, first go to \"General\".. And after that, go to \"Keyboard\".. Click keyboard one more time. After that, add your new keyboard! So, over here.. Under third-party keyboards, select \"Bitmoji\" After this, give it full access permissions! And now, let's open Line.. Let's click on this globe icon... JA, JA, JA, JA, JAN! It showed up... I wonder which I should send to Rinna-chan? *Old man voice* I wonder which will make her happy? I guess I should go with 'I LOVE YOU' after all But then again, she might wanna see some swimsuit.. So it's this one! After that, do this... Copy it like this and paste it! After this, you can send a picture as you would a stamp Oy, Rinna, reply to me using words... I won't be able to react otherwise, right? This won't do. Rinna-chan's an amateur at this after all... She has completely no idea about pictures... I will now send this sad-looking melting ice cream... It melted... Rinna: \"This picture is nice!
