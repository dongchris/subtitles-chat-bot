A: You're still playing baseball

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:00.930
A: And exhausting yourself?

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.730
A: You have some good “stuff”...

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:05.170
A: Why don't you try it already?

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:06.030
A: Being a 'Tuber?

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.420
A: I'll be here to listen to your complaints!

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.870
T: What, ‘Tuber?

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:12.700
A: Yeah, 'Tuber, a 'Tuber!

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:13.530
A: It's currently trending

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.220
A: This industry is really coming on!

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:18.270
T: Well, I'm still a high schooler

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.500
T: And I'm busy with baseball, so...

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:21.510
A: Not a problem!

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:24.520
A: I mean, I portray myself as looking 16

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:25.510
A: But I'm actually 1 year old...

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:26.020
T: Eh?!

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:27.450

A: "Virtual High School Baseball 'Tuber"

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:42.020
T: No no no!

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:43.520
T: I'm not doing it, I'm not doing it!

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.700
T: Also, I'm not confident doing it alone...

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.400
A: You can do it, Chan-tsuba!

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:49.740
A: You could smash it!

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:50.645
T: Smash?

00:01:50.645 --> 00:01:51.860

T: Yeah...

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.400
A: It'll be fine!!

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:57.920
T: Will it...?

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.740
T: But, if I have time I want to practice...

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.560
A: Chan-tsuba, you really like baseball, don't you?

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.140
A: You really do like practicing!

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:06.040

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.780
A: As a Virtual High School Baseballer YouTuber

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:09.660
A: Practice baseball!

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:10.940
A: Like tutorials, tutorials!

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:12.300
A: Doesn’t that hit two birds in one stone?

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.180
A: How's that?

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.820
T: Eh?

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:14.460
T: Uh...

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:18.360

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:19.560
A: It will, it will, it will!

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.060

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:29.240
T: Ehh?!

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:30.500
T: What did you just say?!

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:31.800
A.I.Channel

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.800
T: There's already lots of Virtual YouTubers, aren't there?

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.640
T: I think it'd be difficult to start now...

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:39.200
A: Correct

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.860
A: That's where being different comes in

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:43.820
A: You need to do something new!

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.620
T: I can't come up with anything other than baseball...

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:49.780
A: It's fine!

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.140
A: I said I've got your back!

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:54.650
A: For example, Tsubasa-chan

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:56.400
A: Face the camera

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.840
T: Mhm!

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:57.660
A: That's it!

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:58.430
A: Most people

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.750
T: Mhm!

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:59.780
A: Including myself

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.890
A: Use this kind of angle, right?

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:03.420
T: You see it used often!

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:04.040
A: That's it!

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.360
A: Mhm!

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:05.210
A: Then it'll be

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:06.070
A: Like this!

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.960
T: Oh!

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:07.730
A: For example...

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.270
A: Just by changing the camera angle a little

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:13.150
A: The atmosphere completely changes~!

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:15.700
T: This is the one AI-chan always uses~

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:16.830
A: That's right!

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:18.910
A: Isn't it cute~?

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:19.730
A: Right?

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:21.920
A: Today, just for Tsubasa-chan

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.520
A: I thought I'd use

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:26.910
A: A special angle, especially for you!!

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:27.620
T: Ahh!

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:28.730
A: Now, let's go!

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:29.880
T: Oooh!

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.990
A: Now, Tsubasa-chan!

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.410
T: Yes!

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:32.980
A: Do some baseball pose!

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:33.330
T: Okay!

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:34.290
A: Give it a try!

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:35.390
T: All right, let's go!

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:36.160
A: Yay!

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.900

T: Who knows?

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:13.850
T: But it was fun!

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:14.170
A: Yeah!

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:14.740
A: Well

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:16.000
A: Tsubasa-chan

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.820
A: Baseball is important for you right now, so

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:19.880
T: You have the potential, so...

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.200
T: When you feel like it, I think you should try doing it!

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:23.000
T: Yeah!

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.180
T: If it advertises my baseball club, it might be good...

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:26.400
T: Whenever I have time!

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.360
A: Tsubasa-chan's friends are cute as well~

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.860
T: Eh?!

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:31.580
A: I think it'd be great if they appeared as well!

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.780
A: Like, how about Nozaki-chan!

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:36.060
A: Or Nozaki-chan! (2nd time)

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:36.940
T: AI-chan

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:39.540
T: You're thinking of something weird again, aren't you?

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:41.660
A: No, I'm not?

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:42.800
A: "Nozaki-chan..."

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:45.220
A: "Mufuuu..."

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:46.640
A: I'm not thinking of anything like that

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:50.060
T: You’re definitely making a face that means you are!

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:51.420
T: You're not allowed to!

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:54.700
A: By the way, are we not competing today?

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.520
T: Aah, I haven't advertised at all!

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:58.200
A: You can if you want?

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:00.240
T: I don’t have to win this time?!

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:00.950
T: Unless...

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:02.290
T: You’re up to something again?

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.650
A: So!

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:09.400
A: I’ve gotten tired from filming Tsubasa-chan now

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.960
A: So we won't be competing~

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:15.240

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:44.180
A: Yeah, because I just came up with it

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:46.880
