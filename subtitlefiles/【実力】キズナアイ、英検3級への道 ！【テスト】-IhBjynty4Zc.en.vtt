00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:02.969
Hello everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna AI here!

00:00:02.969 --> 00:00:05.260
Everyone, did you watch this live-stream?

00:00:06.106 --> 00:00:07.574
After… half a year…

00:00:07.574 --> 00:00:08.341
I’ll release a video on...

00:00:08.341 --> 00:00:09.809
English proficiency test... Level 3

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:11.311
There's a scout on LLSIF

00:00:11.311 --> 00:00:13.079
Where you can...

00:00:13.079 --> 00:00:14.047
Only get Nico-chan!

00:00:14.047 --> 00:00:15.460
If, within these 6 months,

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:16.970
In the video I release,

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:19.319
If I can score 70 out of 100,

00:00:19.319 --> 00:00:21.260
Even after spending 30,000 yen…

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:22.288
Isn’t that alright?

00:00:22.288 --> 00:00:24.791
If I don’t… I get it!

00:00:24.791 --> 00:00:25.592
I’ll uninstall the app!

00:00:25.592 --> 00:00:26.326
Whatever!

00:00:26.326 --> 00:00:28.728
I’ll uninstall “Keyaki no Kiseki” too!

00:00:28.728 --> 00:00:31.280
Trying the English Test Level 3 problems,

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:32.465
In order to get at least 70%

00:00:32.465 --> 00:00:34.940
Although I spent 10,000 yen on KeyaKise (app)

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.237
And 30,000 yen on School Festival…

00:00:37.237 --> 00:00:38.140
That’s fine, right?

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:39.460
Alright! Wish me luck

00:00:39.839 --> 00:00:40.907
So with that...

00:00:40.907 --> 00:00:42.842
Today, I’d like to test

00:00:42.842 --> 00:00:43.977
My real English skills!

00:00:43.977 --> 00:00:45.345
I guess I want to see how

00:00:45.345 --> 00:00:46.546
I've improved with English!

00:00:46.546 --> 00:00:47.147
"Aren't you about 70%...

00:00:47.147 --> 00:00:49.482
Of the way through Level 3??"

00:00:49.482 --> 00:00:50.884
"So shouldn't you be able to do it??"

00:00:50.884 --> 00:00:53.253
Even if you say that, I'm still only making my way

00:00:53.253 --> 00:00:55.321
Through studying pronunciation and vocabulary!

00:00:55.321 --> 00:00:57.690
So then, let's go ahead and start!

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.025
A.I.Channel

00:00:59.025 --> 00:01:01.061
Let's start with studying vocab!

00:01:01.061 --> 00:01:01.995
I will be taking the...

00:01:01.995 --> 00:01:03.940
Weblio Vocabulary Test

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:05.799
To test the limits of my vocabulary!

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:06.299
Well...

00:01:06.866 --> 00:01:08.101
Since I feel like it~

00:01:08.101 --> 00:01:09.160
Let's go! Aim for 100 out of 100...

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:10.703
Full score! Yes!

00:01:10.703 --> 00:01:11.871
Level 3!

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:13.920
Hi-

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:14.774
Hiel-

00:01:14.774 --> 00:01:15.942
Hielty...

00:01:15.942 --> 00:01:16.560
What is this…?

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.111
Huh?!

00:01:18.111 --> 00:01:19.079
What was it again?

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:19.700
This...

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.915
Wait a second! Does this have a time limit?

00:01:21.915 --> 00:01:22.882
I have no idea!!

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:23.930
Wait...

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:24.851
I-I don't know...

00:01:24.851 --> 00:01:25.600
"None of the above"!

00:01:26.519 --> 00:01:26.986
E-

00:01:26.986 --> 00:01:27.353
El-

00:01:28.254 --> 00:01:28.822
Elea--

00:01:28.822 --> 00:01:29.389
Erea- Area!!

00:01:29.389 --> 00:01:30.090
Area

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.600
Area!

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:32.720
Menseki (area)? I dunno!

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:34.050
Um...

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:35.195
Ai-

00:01:35.195 --> 00:01:37.430
Alilearity-?

00:01:38.665 --> 00:01:39.732
Aha~!

00:01:39.732 --> 00:01:40.867
I dunno!

00:01:41.568 --> 00:01:42.502
Joshin!

00:01:42.502 --> 00:01:44.240
J-Jo-Jo-Joshin...

00:01:44.737 --> 00:01:45.672
Josh

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:47.950
Isn't it none of the above...?

00:01:48.675 --> 00:01:49.309
Ku-

00:01:49.309 --> 00:01:49.776
Ku--

00:01:49.776 --> 00:01:51.080

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.580
Kuzu!
(Trash)

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:53.746
I'll go with trash

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:57.820
C-Crou-

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:58.510
Croud...

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:00.940
Huh...?

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:01.680
Teki (enemy)?

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:02.489
Is it enemy?

00:02:02.489 --> 00:02:03.156
I don’t...

00:02:03.156 --> 00:02:03.623
I dunn'-

00:02:03.623 --> 00:02:04.858
I dunno!

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.240
Important!

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.620
Important means...

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.430
This one...

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:10.230
Number one!

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:10.810
It means important (juuyou)

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:12.900
Ealmufu...

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.660
Ealmufu...

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:14.280
Hmm?

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.902
Might be this one, right?

00:02:15.902 --> 00:02:17.036
Number one. Earmuff!

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:18.240
Alon!

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:19.460
Alone!

00:02:20.073 --> 00:02:21.641
Is it along~?

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:23.750
I wonder if it's number one!

00:02:24.711 --> 00:02:25.278
Pre-

00:02:25.278 --> 00:02:27.046
Prisidento-

00:02:27.046 --> 00:02:28.715
President

00:02:28.715 --> 00:02:30.400
(AI-chan noises)

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:32.519
(More AI-chan noises)

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:32.852
Hmm~

00:02:32.852 --> 00:02:33.520
(lol)

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.790
Tiger!

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:35.290
Tora (tiger)

00:02:36.756 --> 00:02:37.357
Af-

00:02:37.357 --> 00:02:38.291
Afreid

00:02:38.291 --> 00:02:39.740
Afraighd? Hmm?

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.610
Afraighd?

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.300
This is probably right!

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:44.240
Pay! I know pay!

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:45.120
It's this one

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.700
Nice!

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:47.040
Pu-

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.630
Pa-

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:48.334
Pile...

00:02:48.334 --> 00:02:48.835
Pile

00:02:49.202 --> 00:02:49.769
Pile?

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:50.470
Is it ita (board)?

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:51.120
I wonder

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:53.340
Still!

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.680
Huh-

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:55.320
Umm-

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:56.540
Maybe it's number one...

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:59.420
O-
Order, order!

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:01.730
This one?

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:03.760
Order...

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.140
I feel like I'm off-

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.990
None of the above, none of the above!

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.940
Pu-

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:08.490
Pai-

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:10.340
Person! Person?

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:11.650
I know I've heard this before!

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.980
Huh?

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:14.330
I'll go with number two, mmm

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.830
Huh-

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:15.980
Kid

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.980
Um, kid means...

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:21.367
Kid means like a child, doesn't it?

00:03:21.367 --> 00:03:22.602
I just dunno~

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.810
Sa-

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:26.870
San...stuary...?

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.990
I'll go with number one!

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:33.530
Ga-Gar-Garlic!

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:34.310
That's ninniku (garlic), right?

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:36.680
Return!

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.140
Return means...

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:40.410
Like, going home, returning...

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:42.755
Hi-

00:03:42.755 --> 00:03:43.790
Fire...

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:44.624
Fire!!

00:03:44.624 --> 00:03:45.992
Fire!

00:03:45.992 --> 00:03:47.360
Fire means hi (fire), huh?

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.860
Hm~!

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:49.410
Chimpanzee!

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:51.440
Ma-

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:52.050
Mayor...

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:54.690
Mayor...

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:55.890
Mayor...

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:57.290
Hmm, I think it's number two!

00:03:58.871 --> 00:03:59.639
Huh?

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:05.178
Ahh-HHHH!!

00:04:05.178 --> 00:04:06.350
But, wait!

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:07.870
Huh?

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:09.048
But...
Wait, wait!

00:04:09.048 --> 00:04:10.316
Was this even worth it?

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:12.030
I suppose it was

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:14.554
Huhh...

00:04:14.554 --> 00:04:16.040
Final result: E

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:19.192
I'll have extreme trouble passing...

00:04:19.192 --> 00:04:20.610
Um...

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:21.427
Well, everyone, my English proficiency

00:04:21.427 --> 00:04:23.663
Is exactly as you've seen here

00:04:23.663 --> 00:04:24.264
So...

00:04:24.264 --> 00:04:25.865
Wouldn't it be great...

00:04:25.865 --> 00:04:26.499
If I could understand...

00:04:26.499 --> 00:04:27.634
More than "Level 3"

00:04:27.634 --> 00:04:30.069
By the 18th of June?

00:04:30.069 --> 00:04:32.071
Without using any plug-ins or anything!!

00:04:32.071 --> 00:04:34.073
To all the humans who are

00:04:34.073 --> 00:04:35.708
Studying so hard for their exams...

00:04:35.708 --> 00:04:37.443
Please look after yourselves!

00:04:37.443 --> 00:04:38.678
I will also properly and laboriously

00:04:38.678 --> 00:04:40.780
Study without any cheating

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:41.547
So please...

00:04:41.547 --> 00:04:42.815
Watch over me

00:04:42.815 --> 00:04:43.583
You get it, right?

00:04:43.583 --> 00:04:45.618
Even on Level 3, I could barely pass!!

00:04:45.618 --> 00:04:47.987
To the people saying things like "Level 3? Easy peasy!"

00:04:47.987 --> 00:04:49.822
You should now know it's not so easy peasy!!

00:04:50.456 --> 00:04:51.658
So the moral of story?

00:04:51.658 --> 00:04:53.326
Vocabulary is absolutely important

00:04:53.326 --> 00:04:54.427
It certainly is important

00:04:54.427 --> 00:04:56.429
But sentences are even more so!

00:04:56.429 --> 00:04:58.064
If you don't understand sentences, then what's the point?!

00:04:58.064 --> 00:05:00.833
If you understand sentences, you'll get along just fine!

00:05:00.833 --> 00:05:01.868
That's exactly right!!

00:05:01.868 --> 00:05:02.268
Alright!

00:05:02.268 --> 00:05:03.303
So let's get to the next test!

00:05:03.303 --> 00:05:05.310
This is a past Level 3 English Proficiency exam!

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:06.139
Tada!

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:07.200
Problem #1

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:11.160
"In the next conversation piece,
please pick the most appropriate answer"

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.346
"To fill the blank from answers 1 to 4"

00:05:13.346 --> 00:05:17.470
"I'm sorry, I- Tina- Tina!"

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:21.688
"I forgot to- ba...nning?"

00:05:21.688 --> 00:05:26.826
Hm? "Your di-dictionary to school"

00:05:26.826 --> 00:05:30.370
"That's ok-ok! OK-OK!"

00:05:31.064 --> 00:05:34.350
Um, what was a dictionary again?

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:37.637
What's a dictionary?!

00:05:37.637 --> 00:05:40.973
Dictionary- I got it, a dictionary is a jisho (dictionary)!

00:05:40.973 --> 00:05:42.875
A dictionary is a jisho (dictionary), right?

00:05:42.875 --> 00:05:47.080
"I forgot the dictionary..."

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:48.881
I don't know what burning is though!

00:05:48.881 --> 00:05:50.350
Something like "I forgot", right?

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:51.884
"That's okay..."

00:05:51.884 --> 00:05:54.887
I know this! This is... um...

00:05:54.887 --> 00:05:59.459
"Sorry, I forgot my dictionary at school!"

00:05:59.459 --> 00:06:01.120
He's saying something like that

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:05.798
And the girl is like "okey-dokey, wanna use... mine?", something like that!

00:06:05.798 --> 00:06:08.101
Answer three! Number three, number three!

00:06:08.101 --> 00:06:10.970
And the correct answer was... number four!!

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:12.805
If you chose number three...

00:06:12.805 --> 00:06:13.906
You're an idiot~!

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:19.680
"I'm so... ne-nerbaus?" Hm?

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:22.782
Ne-Nervaus?

00:06:22.782 --> 00:06:24.417
"Aibout..."

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:28.860
"Tomorrow's Spanish test-" Spanish...

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:31.900
Spanish is...

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:32.625
What was it?

00:06:32.625 --> 00:06:36.160
What does Spanish mean- was it something else...

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:37.764
I dunno! What was it?

00:06:37.764 --> 00:06:39.298
Some test!

00:06:39.298 --> 00:06:42.168
I don't know that word after "so"!

00:06:42.168 --> 00:06:48.007
"I have a test tomorrow... a Spanish one"

00:06:48.007 --> 00:06:52.090
"Don't worry" is like... "don't worry", right?

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:54.013
"You can totally do it!"

00:06:54.013 --> 00:06:57.517
"The test is so easy!", something like that?

00:06:57.517 --> 00:06:58.484
Yes, number two!

00:06:58.484 --> 00:06:59.600
And the correct answer is...

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:01.340
Oh, it's number two!!

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:03.289
Wow, I did it- praise me~

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:08.027
"Tomoko, can you tell me about life in Japan?"

00:07:08.027 --> 00:07:08.820
"Sure..."

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:10.860
Su-Sure

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:13.800
"I want to..."

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:17.180
"Learn? about the food"

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:19.705
"And the people~"

00:07:19.705 --> 00:07:25.044
"Tomoko, please tell me about"

00:07:25.044 --> 00:07:28.581
Your life in Japan", something like that?

00:07:28.581 --> 00:07:30.149
I don't know!!

00:07:30.149 --> 00:07:33.686
"What would you like to know?"

00:07:33.686 --> 00:07:35.922
Seems like it's number one!!

00:07:35.922 --> 00:07:37.080
And the correct answer is...!

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:40.026
Number one! I did it again!

00:07:40.026 --> 00:07:42.061
Look, I'm pretty good! I can do this!

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:43.563
A.I.Channel!

00:07:43.563 --> 00:07:45.932
And, finish~!

00:07:45.932 --> 00:07:47.033
And the results were

00:07:47.033 --> 00:07:49.769
2 right answers out of 3!

00:07:49.769 --> 00:07:52.572
Huh, isn't this pretty easy~?

00:07:52.572 --> 00:07:54.507
No, well, saying that!

00:07:54.507 --> 00:07:57.877
The results now that we've reaffirmed my English skills

00:07:57.877 --> 00:07:59.278
Are that...

00:07:59.278 --> 00:08:01.147
Although my vocabulary is terrible

00:08:01.147 --> 00:08:02.081
Sentences are actually

00:08:02.081 --> 00:08:04.350
Pretty doable!

00:08:04.350 --> 00:08:07.153
I want to really improve the extent of my vocabulary

00:08:07.153 --> 00:08:08.221
Anyway, everyone

00:08:08.221 --> 00:08:09.989
Please look forward to June!

00:08:09.989 --> 00:08:11.860
And to all the people studying for the English Proficiency Test

00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:13.326
Let's work hard together!
