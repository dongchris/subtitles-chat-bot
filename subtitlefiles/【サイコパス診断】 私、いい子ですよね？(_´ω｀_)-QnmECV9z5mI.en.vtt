00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.100
Hello everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna AI here!

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:05.520
Everyone, do all of you know what a 'Psychopath' is?

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.680
Usually they're very gentle

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.940
But they can unexpectedly do very bad things as well

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:12.640
And they seem to say aggressive words

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:14.100
That's what it says on the internet

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.060
Well... it's something that has nothing to do with me, right?

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.560
I...

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.380
Don't use bad words...

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.620
...

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:23.480
"OmamajiFK" means...

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:24.740
... "You're really a ******"

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:25.320
That's right!

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:27.540
I don't say bad words

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.160
...

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:30.820
AAAAAAAAAAAAAH!

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:34.140
REALLY, YOU'RE! REALLY I WON'T FORGIVE YOU!!

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.800
IN NO WAY, I PLAN TO FORGIVE YOUUU!

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.740
I WON'T FORGIVE YOU OLD...!

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:40.300
Old woman, I won't forgive you!

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.540
Why do you have such long arms?!

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:45.120
That's disgusting!

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.240
Old woman, I don't plan to forgive you!

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.380
You made me lose years of my life!

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:51.440
Mmm...

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:52.020
...

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:52.720
Eh?

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:54.920
A.I.Channel!

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:55.960
Transmission!

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.280
Because I got a bit uneasy...

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.280
I am going to do a "Psychopath diagnosis"

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.180
Having said that, let's do it at once!

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.040
Psychopath diagnosis... let's begin

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:09.660
"Please imagine the scene where someone is attacked by stray dogs. What kind of person is being attacked?"

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:11.240
Uhh..."A young lady"

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.480
"Imagine where you are being chased by something terrible"

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.100
"Now, who or what are you being chased by?"

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.140
Mmm... zombie

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.240
That tends to happen in movies, right?

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.220
"You find yourself visiting the shooting ranges at your destination"

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:32.080
"When you set up a gun, there are human targets about 30 meters ahead"

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.220
"Which part of the body do you aim at?"

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:35.260
...

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.480
I think I understood what's being asked here

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:40.860
I guess aiming at the heart would be the most kind option?

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.080
After all, they would die in one hit

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.700
If you aim at other parts of the body, without killing them...

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.780
That would seem like something a psychopath would do, so then...

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:49.760
"Heart"!

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:56.780
"From now, you have to help friends who are hiding in a shopping mall surrounded by hordes of zombies"

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.300
"If you were to choose one of the following as your weapon, which would it be?"

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.500
"Electric powered saw"! It looks strong!

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.780
"Which of the following animals would you like to have as your companion?"

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.560
Eh... mermaids are animals? Aren't they human?

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:09.320
A person and a fish? (Reading kanji)

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:10.180
Um, tiger!

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:11.940
It seems strong and could protect me!

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.500
"What is it that you desire the most?"

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.200
Eh! This one maybe? It looks cool!

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.340
"Mysterious crystal balls said to have the power to save the world"

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:20.040
Yes

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.840
"You entered to an unmanned private house while being chased by a ruthless killer"

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.900
"For the moment you decide to hide, where will you hide?"

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:27.840
Where should I hide?

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.700
The back of a large TV!

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.740
"While watching TV without thinking too much, a human-shaped alien invaded Earth"

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:35.500
"While watching TV without thinking too much, a human-shaped alien invaded Earth"

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.220
"Well, what do you think is the reason the alien came to Earth?"

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.600
Well... to make friends with the people on Earth... probably!

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:43.980
We're the same, right?

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.400
"Most unforgivable thing?"

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.060
Well... skipping work without a reason...

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.360
Ah! "A young man who doesn't yield the priority seat!"

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.340
Oh, but they might be injured or sick

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:54.800
Eh... "Talk bad about the person behind their back"

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:55.440
Last question!

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.100
"A turtle you rescued from some children who were harassing it"

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.180
"Offered to take you to the Palace of the Dragon King at the bottom of the ocean as thanks"

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.540
"Telling you: 'Hold on to my back"?"

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.960
"If you had to choose an answer, what would you say?"

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:07.160
Because it's a nice kid...

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.400
"Oh, I don't need something in return, please don't worry about me" Maybe?

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:11.300
Hmm?

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:12.120
Uh...

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.000
"You have similar characteristics with obsession of peace"

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.560
Huh? Liar! Liar! This is definitely lying!

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.880
How is it possible for me to be a psychopath?!

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.420
I properly aimed at the heart like you should...

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.200
And in the last question, I said I didn't need anything in return...

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.800
Isn't it good enough with those?

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.500
This is absolutely impossible!!

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:28.900
Huh? It really can't be!

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:29.800
Really, I'll kill...

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:34.100
