00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:17.580
T: Actually...!

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.300
A: WAIT... WAIT... WAIT!

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.120
A: CAMERA STOP!

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.720
*Please be patient and wait for a moment â™¡*

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:27.620
A: Ya! You! Tsubasa-kun, you...
T: Ah!

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:28.560
T: What's wrong?

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.300
A: Being energetic is good...
T: Ah, ahh..

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:33.500
A: Like the baseball player you are...
T: Ah.. hmm..

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.480
A: There is this thing called a gameplan...

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:35.980
T: Ah!

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.620
A: But you're young, so it's fine even though you just did that relentlessly...

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:39.120
T: Yes... yes..

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.000
A: But... look... at least...
T: Mm.. ah!

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.500
A: This! This is my show!

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.740
T: Aah! I'm sorry!
A: Which means...! I'm the director here!

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:49.380
T: I see..

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.160
A: After that, just follow what we discussed earlier during the meeting...

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:53.020
T: Oh, I understand...

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.020
A: The sign is...
T: Sign is?

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.880
A: This...
T: Wait.. that's too complicated...

00:00:58.245 --> 00:00:59.765
A: Like this...

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.380
A: For now, if you touch this fluffy..
T: Fluffy...

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:06.135
A: Well... it's just that..
T: But...

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.380
T: But Tsubasa doesn't have this fluffy thing...

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:12.300
A: I'll be the one doing it! I'm the director!
T: Ah! I see... I see... you're right... you're right...

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.000
T: I understand, no problem!
A: So... if I touch my fluffy...

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.295
T: Fluffy...

00:01:16.295 --> 00:01:18.905
A: If I touch it.. then bunt 
T: I got it!

00:01:18.905 --> 00:01:20.605
T: I'm in your care!
A: Alright! Here we go!

00:01:21.225 --> 00:01:24.385
A: Hello everyone! Virtual Youtuber Kizuna Ai here!

00:01:24.385 --> 00:01:27.705

A: JA, JAN!

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.165
T: Wahhhhh!

00:01:30.165 --> 00:01:32.680
T: Hello everyone!

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.980
T: I'm from a widely downloaded smartphone app..

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.460
T: Called "Hachigatsu no Cinderella Nine"..

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.100
T: And I'm Arihara Tsubasa!

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.620
Everyone! Please call it "Hachinai"!

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.700
A: YEAH! SHU!

A: With that being said! Today!

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.560
A: Tsubasa-Chan from Hachinai!

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.200
A: As the captain of publicity...
T: Yes! Yeah!

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.940
T: Thank you! Yeah!
Both: Yaaay!

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:59.420
A: You look hyped!
T: Eh? What?

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:00.680
A: Tsubasa-chan, you...

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:01.220
T: Yes?

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:02.480
A: ... How old are you?

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.100
T: Let's see... right now I'm just 15 years old...

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.500
T: I'm in my first year of high school..

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.780
T: And I'll turn 16 on the 3rd of March..
A: Oooh...

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.280
A: Oh, a first year high school student...
T: Eh? Wh-what is it?

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.420
A: Aren't you young and lively?

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.700
T: Ah, your eyes are slightly scary...

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:14.500
A: Eh? I'm not scary..

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:15.380
T: You ARE scary!

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:16.400
A: Do you see me as scary?

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:17.880
T: Y-you're looking VERY scary!

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.380
A: Eh, I wonder why that is, that's weird...

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:20.920
A: Aren't... I cute?

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:21.900
T: You are cute!

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:22.660
A: I'm not scary, right?

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.480
T: You're cute but for a second there, I thought I saw some kind of creep...

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:26.460
A: Eh?
T: Uh...

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.020
A: Eh, if you say stuff like that you'll "disappear", you know?

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:32.260
T: Eh, stop, STOP! You're fr-frightening, Ai-chan~

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:33.340
*weeps*

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:34.660
A: Tsubasa-chan...
T: Hm?

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.400
A: What colour do you like?
T: Eh?

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.700
T: Me? I really like yellow

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.580
A: Oh? So you like yellow...

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:41.880
T: I like yellow, I love yellow the most!

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:42.660
A: Well then...
T: Hm?

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.320
A: Your panties today are... yellow?

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.820
T: Eh?

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.500
A: That skirt moves around a lot doesn't it?
T: Uh..

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.020
T: I-it does move around a lot but...

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:49.580
A: Try jumping for a bit?

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:50.340
T: Okay..
A: Uh huh...

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:51.220
T: Ready, set...

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:52.320
T: JUMP!

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.940
A: Keep going~

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:53.980
T: Eh, wh-wh-what?!

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:55.220
T: Eh, wow, this is fun

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:56.460
A: Hey, you know...

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:57.600
A: Are you wearing spats?

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:58.560
T: That's right...

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:59.580
T: Because I'm in the baseball club!

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.700
A: Is that so? As expected of you..
T: I have to make myself easier to move around

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:02.980
A: Spats...

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:04.120
A: After this...

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.240
A: You're going to change your clothes~
T: Eh?

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.760
T: What did you say? What do you mean!?
A: Eh...? Eh?

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.060
A: Please, please~
T: Eh what...?

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.580
T: I won't do anything! I'm still having my spats on...

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:14.580
A: Oh, ok... so just a bit...

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.900
A: Please do that~
T: Ai-chan is scary!

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.720
T: I came here for promotion but now I want to go home!
A: Huuuh!?

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.720
A: You can't go back!?
T: Yes, I won't go back, I won't go back!

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.360
A: It'll be very sad to see you go given that you're the very first cute...

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:27.420
A: Cute girl that came here...
T: Thanks, ah, thanks a lot~

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.000
A: Actually, another girl came here before~

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.180
T: Oh? How was that girl?

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.640
A: Well she was in 2D so...
T: That's cute, isn't it~?

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:37.860
A: But after all, a girl looking like a real high schooler is really great~

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:40.940
T: Ah... Somehow, Ai-chan became scary again!
A: I'm not scary!

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:42.600
T: It's just a bit... a bit scary!

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.220
A: Look... I'm also... 16 years old! You know?

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:46.540
T: Oh right!
A: Definitely~

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:47.480
A: Yeah~
T: Yeah~

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.600
A: But well, that's the settings..
Both: Eh?

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.600
T: Today... I came here for promotion!

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:55.480
A: Oh? Promotion?
T: Yes, yes, so that's why...

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.260
T: It's a rare chance so...

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.400
T: If you can actually let me do my publicity...
A: Yeah... but... that's...

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:02.880
A: I don't know if you can...
T: Eh, I can't!?

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.840
T: But you said I could, that's why I came here!

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:07.000
A: Did I really say that?

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.520
T: Eh? Eh?

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:10.560
T: Ai-chan, Ai-chan your face is becoming scary again!

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.060
A: No but, even if it's Tsubasa-chan's wish...

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:16.500
A: I can't really just... say yes...

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:17.920
T: So that was a lie...
A: Hora~

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:20.980
T: Then... what should I do in order to promote Hachinai?

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.540
A: What should I do..? You know... actually...

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:26.500
A: Youtube is...

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:27.820
A: A tough world...

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.900
A: As a program, the number of views needs to increase!

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:32.420
T: Ah... a tough world...

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:35.900
A: Yes...
T: So you mean I have to contribute to that too, right?

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:36.980
A: Yes!
T: Hmm~

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:39.700
A: You should understand if you've watched my videos...

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:41.460
A: I often sacrifice my body for that!

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:41.960
T: Wha!?

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.340
A: It's serious business...
T: Ah..

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:47.780
T: No, no, but I'm in the baseball club!

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:50.000
T: So I'll never lose a match!
A: Oh!?

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.780
A: Then, let's have a game!
T: Ok, the match is on!

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:54.760
A: Putting Hachinai's publicity on the line!

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.380
A: It's a serious match of stamina!

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:00.600
A: Tsubasa, like this...

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:01.520
T: Oh!

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:02.380
A: It's invisible to idiots...

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:03.720
T: Invisible to idiots?

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:04.960
A: A magic mat...

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:06.740
T: Ah, I can see it!

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:07.700
A: Oh? Ooh?

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:09.260
T: Ah, I'm a genius!

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:10.620
A: The same?
T: The same!

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:12.600
A: Now, this...
T: This?

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:14.240
A: We're going to do an upper body stretch...

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:15.320
T: Upper body stretch?

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:15.940
A: Yes...

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
A: We've done this plenty of times before on A.I.Channel...

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:18.740
T: Ah, is that right?

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:21.320
A: This time, the height of the stretch is normally what matters, right?

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:21.960
T: The height...

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:23.280
A: Instead of just the height...

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:28.740
A: We'll measure how long you can stretch and stay still!

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:29.780
A: A measure of your strength and determination...

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:31.320
T: This really is a contest of stamina, isn't it?

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:34.120
A: Even though, I'm not sure we have muscles

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:35.760
T: You're right *laughs*

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:37.760
T: I'll try my best!
Both: Oh!

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:39.580
A: And, for deciding who goes first...

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:40.940
A: Since we're here...

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:42.480
A: Let's decide with rock-paper-scissors!

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:43.600
T: Sounds good!

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:46.000
Both: Rock, paper, scissors!

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:47.640
Both: Aaah!

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:48.980
T: I won!

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:51.480
A: And...

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:53.040
A: Start!

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:54.220
T: How's this?

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:55.920
A: That's pretty good
T: Aaaaaah!

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:57.200
T: This is bad!

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:58.600
Onscreen: During production, Tsubasa was configured to be extraordinarily good at sports

00:05:58.720 --> 00:05:59.960
A: You know, with moons~

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:01.420
A: With flowers~

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:02.460
A: Or checkered~
T: Aaugh..

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:03.680
A: Or striped~

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:05.340
A: Or symbols...
T: Aaaagh!

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:06.640
A: Or lace...
T: [Agony continues]

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:08.500
A: Which do you like?
T: [Crying in pain]

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:10.320
T: I can't answer that!

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:12.060
[Ded]

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:13.700
A: Ah.. Ok, next is my turn!

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:14.200
T: Ah!

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:15.840
T: Ok, let's go!

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:17.420
T: And, start!

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:17.920
A: Ooh!

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:18.440
T: Ah!

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:19.420
T: Ah!

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:21.540
A: This is pretty easy...

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:24.180
T: Eh? Hold on! This looks like I've lost!

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:25.040
A: This is a lot easier than I thought

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:27.220
T: You're kidding, you're kidding me...
A: What should I do?

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:28.780
A: I'm sorry
T: Eh? Eh? Eh?

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:32.040
T: Ah, Ai, your clothes are so cute..
A: Right?

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:34.360
A: If you get the distribution you can wear them too...

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:38.380
T: You can wear them? I can wear them too?
A: You can

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:39.000
T: Eh? I want to try it!

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.500
A: You can become me..
T: I can become you?
A: You can

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:44.100
T: I want to wear the fluffy thing too..
(Referring to Ai's headband)

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:47.180
A: Right? I want it to be merchandised
T: I want to it to be merchandised too!

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:50.500
A: We distribute the model, so you can get it too!
T: All of it?
(Ai Chan owns the 3D model)

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:53.140
T: Anyone can do it?
A: Yes, it's a little sad...

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:57.140
T: Even men- huh? Sad?
A: It's you know, kind of sad...

00:06:57.140 --> 00:06:58.680
T: It won't be original anymore...

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:00.860
A: As for me, it makes me happy
T: It makes you happy?

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:03.560
A: It makes me happy but it's alright from time to time if it's not me who does it..

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:04.740
A: Eh?
T: Eh?

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:07.300
T: Why would you say that?
A: But then I'm...

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:09.980
A: I might do you as well, Tsubasa..

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:12.600
T: Eh? What do you mean? Huh?

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:14.600
Both: Huh? Eh?

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:16.600
T: You can't do that! Tsubasa is Tsubasa!

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:18.680
T: Ai-chan, you're amazing!

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:20.480
T: Your back muscles are incredible
A: Right? What should I do next?

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:24.480
T: But this really means that I've lost, haven't I?
A: Hey.. hey...

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:26.000
A: Can we finish now?

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:30.440
A: Results time!
T: Waaaah!

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:32.980
A: ... But we don't really need that, do we?
T: Not really...

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:35.980
A: Ok! We'll present them anyway...
T: Yes!

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.700
A: Tsubasa-chan... 39 seconds!
T: Mm..

00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:42.460
T: Yay, I actually did 39 seconds!
Both: Yaaay!

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:45.680
A: And me, Kizuna Ai senpai...

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:47.660
A: One minute...

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:49.700
A: And seven seconds!

00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:51.420
*Winner: Kizuna Ai*

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:55.260
T: And still you could have kept going...

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:56.220
A: That's right

00:07:56.220 --> 00:07:57.700
T: Uuh.. you could have done more...

00:07:57.940 --> 00:08:00.160
A: This is the difference between a human and an A.I...

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:05.100
T: Ah, I need to try harder, I need to try harder to surpass an A.I!

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:06.580
A: That's right! You're in the baseball club after all...
T: You're right...

00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:07.580
T: That's how it is...

00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:11.120
T: But if I go home like this, they'll get mad at me...

00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:13.040
A: They'll get mad?

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:13.540
T: *sniff*

00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:15.200
T: That's why... if you could...

00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:17.560
T: Just please.. let me advertise it for me Ai-chan!

00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:19.380
A: What should I doooo?
T: Eeeh?!

00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:21.060
T: Please! Please...

00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:21.560
A: But you know what...?

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:22.620
A: I also..

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:24.400
A: Don't really have blood, but I do..

00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:24.920
T: Ah..

00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:27.380
T: You don't, but you do?
A: I don't but I do..

00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:28.074
T: So that means...

00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:28.580
A: That means...

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:29.940
A: You know what...

00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:31.280
A: Because it might lose the meaning of the match...

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:31.780
T: Ah..

00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:33.220
A: And because you're kind of a good girl...
T: Ah..

00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:35.020
A: I thought that I'd have to give you one more chance...

00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:38.800
T: I'll do anything! If you advertise me, I'll do anything!

00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:40.360
A: You just said you'd do anything, right...?

00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:41.600
T: That's what I just said, yeah..
A: Get naked

00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:42.480
T: Eh?

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:45.160
A: That's obviously a lie~

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:46.260
T: Right! I knew it!

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:49.360
A: I'm not that evil~
T: Thank god, thank god, thank god~

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:50.360
A: So...

00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:51.820
A: If you...

00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:53.440
A: Can make me...

00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:55.160
A: Go "Kyuun"..

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:56.880
A: I'll advertise it for you!

00:08:57.340 --> 00:08:59.220
T: Waah! When you say "kyuun"...

00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:02.140
T: I never did something like that, but...

00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:04.380
T: But I'll try my hardest!
A: Ooh!

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:06.800
T: Ehhhh...

00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:09.040
T: Could you please become...

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:10.440
T: The baseball team's coach so you...

00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:14.460
T: Could go for the championship with us?!

00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:16.780
T: Mmm..

00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:18.340
A: Kyuuun!

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
It's Tsubasa's PR (Public Relations) time!

00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:24.140
August's Cinderella Nine is about...

00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:27.100
A baseball game experiencing puberty..

00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:28.500
That can be played on a smartphone app...

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:33.060
For all you users, you can play as the girl's baseball team's coach...

00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:36.020
And aim for Koushien with us!
(Most well known baseball stadium in Japan)

00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:45.760
That being said... We're still a brand new baseball team... There will be many challenges and difficulties for us to overcome..

00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:49.600
High school specialties like friendship, worries, low grades...

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:52.980
As well as some temptations~!

00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:55.740
With all of that included...

00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:58.320
Let's enjoy...

00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:00.160
Our impermanent high school life together!

00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:03.540
And we look forward to have a coach who can go through all of this with us together!

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:07.440
You certainly have to try playing this game!

00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:09.800
I'll be counting on you!

00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:11.440
A: So how was that?

00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:13.040
T: Amazing! That was a lot of fun!

00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:14.340
A: Ah! I'm glad you said that!

00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:18.320
T: I was thinking if Ai-chan would play this game I'd be soooo happy!

00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:18.820
A: Oh! I will

00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:19.580
T: Thank you!

00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:21.520
A: I will get Tsubasa-chan, your character ingame!

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:22.020
T: Please!

00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:23.100
A: Oh? Eh?

00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:25.460
A: With this, we're friends, right?

00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:26.780
T: We're friends!

00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:27.680
A: We did it!

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:30.620
Both: I made a friend!

00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:31.840
A: Come to play sometime...

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:32.600
T: Of course!

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:33.740
A: Oh!
T: Please let me play here!

00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:35.920
A: Of course! Of course! Next time...

00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:36.560
A: You'll have to show me your panties..

00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:37.480
A: Eh?
T: Eh?

00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:38.920
...

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:41.920
A: Thank you for the fun time today!

00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:43.760
T: Thank you very much!

00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:47.160
Both: I'll be counting on you from now on!

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:50.000
A: Everybody, please download the game and get Tsubasa-chan ingame!

00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:53.460
T: By all means, please play this game!

00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:54.220
A: Please!

00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:57.620
A: Ready... set... go!

00:10:57.620 --> 00:10:59.200
Both: Shuuu!

00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:03.420
A: And with that being said.. this was Virtual Youtuber, Kizuna Ai here!

00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:04.120
A: And!

00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:06.620
T: The one who came from August's Cinderella Nine!

00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:08.240
T: Arihara Tsubasa here!

00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:11.560
Both: See you later!
