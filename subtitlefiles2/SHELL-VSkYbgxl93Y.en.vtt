00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:17.420
Did you love him?

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.080
I don't remember.

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.680
That probably means no.

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:46.800
That's sad, isn't it?

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:48.440
No.

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:53.300
Not really.

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:56.100
Depends on how you look at it, I guess.

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:00.180
Of course you would say that.

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.040
Always so neutral...

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:04.720
and safe.

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.100
That's you.

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:22.940
What would you want to remember?

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.320
What do you mean?

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:28.460
Like, something I've forgotten?

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:31.240
Sure.

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.380
But if I'd really forgotten,

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.140
how would I know about it?

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.040
Or even have any desire to remember it?

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:43.260
Okay anything,

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.120
if you could have a memory of anything,

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:47.060
real or not.

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:49.600
What would it be?

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.400
A fake memory?

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:56.500
You don't make any sense.

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.200
I've always been good at that.

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.600
Here.

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:05.780
Listen.

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.580
Sound of the ocean, captured in a shell.

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:19.780
Like a memory.

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.120
Imagine if it held something different.

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.980
Something more than just the sound,

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:27.020
but just as real.

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.200
What if we had a chance to remember things

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.520
that we never actually experienced?

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.300
What good is it if it didn't happen?

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:38.620
No one would believe it.

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.320
Well, you'd believe it.

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.420
It's about the feeling, that's what matters.

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:44.900
The problem is,

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.760
I like my stories based on reality,

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:50.780
and you like fiction.

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:59.440
It's just nice to be able to decide what happens.

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.420
Tell me what happens.

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.080
Or, what happened,

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.480
in this memory that's never existed until now.

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.560
What would you want to remember?

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:27.880
I'm nervous.

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:32.980
I'm not sure if she can tell.

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:41.140
But for one single arbitrary moment,

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:43.980
I gather enough courage,

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:45.640
and whisper something in her ear.

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.740
Something I've always known but never told her.

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:59.860
Holding my breath only makes my heart beat faster.

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:03.340
She looks at me for the first time,

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:05.280
differently,

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:08.220
but with the same eyes I fell in love with.

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:14.020
She takes my glasses off...

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:29.540
and then...

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:40.180
Nothing.

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:44.060
It doesn't matter.

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:08.760
She takes your glasses off.

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:17.940
and then...

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:33.000
and then...

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:35.100
fiction becomes...

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:36.720
reality.
