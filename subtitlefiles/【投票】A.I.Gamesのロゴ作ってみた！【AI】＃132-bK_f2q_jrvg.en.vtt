00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.740
Hello everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai here!

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:05.220
If you’re wondering what we're doing today...

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:05.860
De-den!

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:08.800
I'd like to change the logo for A.I. Games!

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.980
I've been thinking about it for a while now..

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.640
It's a lot like A.I. Channel

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:14.360
So I was thinking I’d like it just a bit more like, "This is A.I. Games!"

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:16.760
I thought it'd be good to make it more recognisable

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:18.160
And it’s cause of that, that this time..

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.240
I’ll use sites that let you make original logos..

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.560
To make a new logo for A.I. Games!

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.660
Well then, in that case, let's go!

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:27.040
First is this!

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:28.140
“Logaster”!

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.900
On this website...

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.260
You can easily... make logos!

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.180
Isn't this neat, right? Not only that..

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.500
You can make original logos, so then..

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.060
I'd like to make one right now!

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:39.560
Teiyaa!

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:41.420
"Logo Creation Wizard"

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:42.020
"Company name"

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:43.140
Ooohh! Sounds great, right?

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.380
Even though it’s not about a company..

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:46.120
"A.I. Games"

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.060
"Business type"

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:49.620
"Business type"... "Internet"!

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.480
"Internet", "Fine arts", “Fashion”...

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.160
"Entertainment"

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.360
Definitely, I'm more of an entertainer, right?

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.220
So I should choose "Entertainment", right?

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:00.720
Hoi~!

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.160
Oooooooh..

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.460
There's quite a lot, aren't there?

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:06.180
This one's sort of like Windows, right?

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.120
"Deeeeen~", something like that..

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:09.500
Wasn’t it something like "Deeen"?

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:10.760
I definitely want something...

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.360
That’s simple but striking..

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.980
I’d like one that draws attention..

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:17.620
Well...

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:19.040
Which one’s better?

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.440
I'd like one that is game related and that it’s adorable..

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:23.840
But that it’s simple...

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:24.560
Ah, ah...

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.860
This logo that has a puzzle can be a good candidate, right?

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:28.740
And also...

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.300
And also...

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.340
There’s so many that it makes me doubt..

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.880
Ah! Ah! This logo is for video games!

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.220
It’s a logo for video games!

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.180
Although I’d like something a bit more...

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.640
Something more simple, more "zen", "zen"..

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.120
Aaaahh! This!

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:42.140
This is close

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.940
I’d definitely like that "A.I." to be in uppercase letters..

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.860
I wonder if I can modify this in some way..

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:48.380
Ah!

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:49.520
This!

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:51.920
I like it

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:53.560
The given ones too...

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:54.920
It could be...

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.860
There’s really a lot!

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:58.120
There’s so many!

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:59.360
Someone save me!

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.220
There’s so many that I like that I can’t decide..

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.140
Maybe I should choose the puzzle one?

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:05.020
Where..

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:06.180
..Was it?

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.100
I found the puzzle one!

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.760
Ah!

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:10.820
Here, you can edit..

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:11.580
I see

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:12.080
Ooohh!

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.580
Ah!

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.720
You can also change the design, right?

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:15.460
I see..

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:17.380
I see..

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:18.700
In this case...

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:19.460
Eh?

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:20.380
And later...

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:21.720
Ah, you can...

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:22.780
Edit the text..

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:23.880
Can you also edit the icon?

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:24.400
Ah!

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.280
It can be changed!

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.860
I see

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.300
Ooohh..

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:29.020
I see..

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:30.060
Aaahh..

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.560
I can also change the text font

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:32.360
No, I prefer the one before!

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.900
Eh?

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:33.560
I prefer the one before!

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:34.060
Eh?

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.840
"Restart"

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:35.900
Oh, good, good

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:36.580
The color!

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:37.080
"More colors"

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.000
Let’s choose more colors...

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.500
Well, I think it’d have something light blue...

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.700
Can you understand what it feels to do something so difficult? How it feels?

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.740
Isn’t it good like this?

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.400
"Simple is best"

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:48.460
Ah, best to leave it like that

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:49.660
That’s good, right?

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.920
Yes, yes

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:51.920
The simpler...

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:52.500
The better!

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:53.180
Good!

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:54.640
And now, "Save"!

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:55.540
Cha, chan!

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:56.820
I finished!

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.260
The logo for "A.I.Games"!

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:59.700
Candidate #1!

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.140
Next up is this!

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.760
“Logojoy”!

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:02.880
In this case..

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.860
You can create a logo...

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.220
Just by entering a company name!

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:07.900
In that case, let’s go!

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.520
"A.I. Games"

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:14.720
"Pick... 5 or... more... logos... you... like.."

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:18.100
This means "Please choose 5 logos of your liking", right?

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:18.860
I see..

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:20.500
Eh... which one should I choose?

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.480
Definitely if it's too cute..

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.660
In face, it could prove to be too unpleasant to use...

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:26.700
Maybe something like this..

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.960
Ah but, this one's looks related to games, it seems good..

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:30.460
With that case, this is the first one

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:32.000
And now which ones should I choose?.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.580
Eh, which ones should I pick?

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:35.240
This and.. this and... Honey!

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:36.660
This and.. this and...

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:37.580
Eh, which should...?

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:38.960
I’ll follow my instinct! Maybe this one?

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:39.800
One more..

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:40.580
This..

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:41.080
Hey!

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:43.420
The color will be..

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:44.880
Let's see...

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:45.520
Maybe this one?

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:48.040
I’d like a refreshing feel to it..

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.240
Without any "Slogan"!

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:50.440
Three!
(Find and choose 3 symbols)

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.200
I should just pick something, right?

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:53.600
I’ll definitely choose "Games"

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:54.380
"Games"

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:56.520
This one's pretty good, isn't it? It’s kinda cute..

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:59.900
This one's slightly thicker, hmmm..

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:00.940
Okay, the thin one!

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:01.820
This and...

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:04.280
Ah! This one's kinda cute..

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:05.320
Ah! My... this...

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:06.140
Ah! I wonder if there’s not...

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:09.020
Something like my sprout shaped headband...

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:10.580
Hmmmmmm..

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:12.040
If I had to choose...

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.820
I’d definitely like it to have something round..

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:16.280
Hmmm..

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:17.880
Let's see....

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.740
Ah, there’s nothing that has a round shape, but..

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:21.440
Not you... this one..

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:21.940
Good..

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:22.440
Teiyaa!

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.840
Oh! Oooooooh! Ooh!

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:26.400
A lot appeared, right?

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:28.180
You can view all of them like this, right?

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:29.840
Ah, this one's good after all, right?

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.040
It's a simple logo and related to games

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.180
Ah, if this was only in uppercase...

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:35.280
I wonder if there are any..

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.260
There aren't any with uppercase "A.I."!

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.160
It’s the only thing I can’t change!

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.280
Ah, this sort of style's pretty nice..

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:42.260
One more..

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:43.560
Ah, but...

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:46.160
I can edit this on the next step..

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:47.720
If that's the case..

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:49.160
This one's good, this one..

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:51.260
If only.. If only I can change the letters a bit..

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:53.740
Ah, I can tweak it here, right?

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:54.280
Like this..

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:56.880
Hmmm... and next up is...

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:59.940
The font... I’d like to change it just a bit..

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:01.160
I’d like something a bit more..

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:03.860
Pop-like and with a sense of cuteness..

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:06.640
Since it's so simple, the font would be..

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:08.200
Better if it were more cute, right?

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:09.040
Hmmmm..

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:10.680
There's a lot of them, but..

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:13.260
For something slightly simpler and playful..

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:14.620
This one seems nice to me

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:16.440
I’ll definitely choose this one. This, this, this..

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:17.780
For the color...

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:19.680
Oh. Oooooooh..

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.380
Ah, I can change this too..

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:23.260
It's important, but, definitely..

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:25.600
Since I'm always in this white space..

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:28.080
I thought it would be good to have white as the base, but..

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:29.660
Something like that?

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:31.220
And definitely regarding the logo color..

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:32.580
The main channel is pink

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:33.980
The game channel is...

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:35.340
Some kind of green, right?

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:36.240
And this...

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.540
I think this controller is cute, but..

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:39.960
Well, from far away..

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:41.060
It's hard to recognise and..

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:43.340
I feel like since the lines are too thin so..

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:44.760
The logo symbol too... Is it called "symbol"?

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:47.380
I'd like to change the symbol..

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:48.000
Oh!

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:49.560
There’s a lot, right?

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:51.460
Dooo.. do-do do..

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:53.680
I’d definitely like to have something like a controller..

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:54.720
This is adorable!

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:55.880
Ah, but this also works..

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:57.760
Ah! How's this?

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:00.360
It looks fun and easy to recognise..

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:01.480
Doesn’t this looks good?

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:02.660
With this... how is it?

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:04.560
Ah! It looks better than expected!

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:05.880
Doesn't it look good?

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:06.860
I finished!

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:07.940
De, deen~!

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:09.020
Candidate #2!

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:12.060
Well I tried making two of them, but..

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:14.400
They're both pretty good, right?

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:16.660
Man, I expected no less of me...well done..

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:18.860
Everyone, please choose one!

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:20.460
In this video's comments..

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:22.960
I’ll be making a comment for each logo..

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:25.880
So then click on the “Like” button for the logo you liked

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:27.840
The voting period is one week starting from today!

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:29.640
The logo that gets the most likes will be..

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:32.580
The one I'd like to use as A.I. Games' new logo!

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:33.660
Vote please ♡

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:36.160
Well then, this was Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai!

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:37.160
See you later!

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:39.940
There's more at the end!

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:42.100
