00:00:00.075 --> 00:00:02.765
Hello everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai here!

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:06.360
In all your countries, there exists legends, right?

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:09.000
For example, how was the world created?

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.180
And how were human beings born?

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.120
I’m configured with the standard Japan time, so then...

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.040
I’m supposed to be related to Japan, but...

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:21.380
I still haven’t studied regarding Japanese mythology

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:27.300
It's because of that, that today I plan to do a questionnaire to learn about Japanese mythology

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:28.740
♪ A.I.Channel ♪

00:00:28.795 --> 00:00:32.275
In this case, I think I will do a questionnaire regarding the gods in Japanese!

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.880
I count on you, "Random Word Generator"!

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:36.620
Jaka, jaka, jaka, jakaaaa...!

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:37.200
JAN!

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.460
Question number 1: "It’s said that in Japan, there exists 8 million gods"

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.080
"In this case, how are the kanjis for the word “8 million” read?"

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:45.260
8 million...

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:46.800
I suppose it’s not read as that, right?

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:47.840
Hachi...

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.140
Hyaku...

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:51.560
Ban...

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.000
*Satisfied look*

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.460
Hachi hyaku ban! Right?

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:55.520
The correct answer is...

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.560
Yaoyorozu! Aaahh!
(Lit: Uncountable)

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:59.720
I knew the word, but...

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.920
It’s read...

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.240
That way, right?

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:02.780
I see

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:03.340
Next up!

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:05.460
Jaka, jaka, jaka, jaka...

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:05.960
Jan!

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:06.735
Question number 2:

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.400
"Which of the following choices was used as the base for an ancient myth?"

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:11.580
A) The hare and the turtle

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.480
B) The hare of Inaba

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.140
C) Kachi-Kachi Yama
(The Flicking Mountain)

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:16.060
I see!

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:18.220
In this case, well...

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:18.980
B!

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:20.080
The correct answer is...

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:21.220
Oh!

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:22.280
I hit it!

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.280
B! Pin pon! Pin pon!

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:25.000
Yaaaay!

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.520
It definitely is a story in which a hare appears, right?

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:35.220
And the next one!

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:36.820
Drumroll please... bam!

00:01:38.025 --> 00:01:40.265
Regarding the very popular "Yamata no Orochi" (8 headed/tailed Serpent)

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.880
Who was the god that slew it?

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:46.760
A. Amaterasu!

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.620
B. Tsukuyomi!

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:50.820
C. Susano-o?

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.020
Oh, I know the answer to this one! The answer is...

00:01:55.045 --> 00:01:56.475
C! Oh, I was right!

00:01:58.335 --> 00:02:00.595
I'm not quite sure why though

00:02:00.785 --> 00:02:03.945
These seem quite hard, right?

00:02:03.945 --> 00:02:05.315
The stories of gods...

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.420
In Japan nowadays and all over the world, these stories spread...

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.660
After all, in times like this...

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.420
In anime, manga and...

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.780
Games do these things really appear!

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:20.035
With that being said, as we have definitely gone over...

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.900
The topic of Japanese Gods, I'd like to introduce the game called Kamurai Tribe

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.220
To everyone out here!

00:02:24.595 --> 00:02:26.135
I'd like to get to it straight away!

00:02:26.685 --> 00:02:27.685
Kamurai Tribe!

00:02:35.975 --> 00:02:38.975
After Yamata no Orochi was sealed for thousands of years...

00:02:39.415 --> 00:02:41.655
A shadow swept over the peaceful lands...

00:02:41.665 --> 00:02:43.945
Making all the people suffer

00:02:45.335 --> 00:02:46.865
The one standing there was...

00:02:47.305 --> 00:02:49.745
Kamurai

00:02:49.745 --> 00:02:53.045
The swordsmen who had the powers of various gods...

00:02:54.395 --> 00:02:56.565
In order to protect the things they loved...

00:02:57.005 --> 00:02:58.835
In order to protect the people they cherished...

00:03:00.005 --> 00:03:02.255
To protect the temple they cherished...

00:03:03.285 --> 00:03:06.135
The Kamurai placed their lives on the line

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.500
This is what the story seems like!

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.915
Just like the title suggests, the "Kamurai"

00:04:01.915 --> 00:04:04.775
Seem like they're very important!

00:04:04.775 --> 00:04:07.765
While the wait was definitely long...

00:04:07.765 --> 00:04:10.585
I'd like to try to get Gacha tickets from Kamurai!

00:04:10.585 --> 00:04:13.545
Between which god's power I get, I'm hoping you know, it'll be cute!

00:04:13.545 --> 00:04:16.135
That way if I get it, I can maximize the impression and...

00:04:16.135 --> 00:04:18.025
Go ahead and play the game!

00:04:18.525 --> 00:04:20.875
Please be a cute girl!

00:04:21.185 --> 00:04:22.545
Please!

00:04:27.715 --> 00:04:29.575
Cute girl! Cute girl! Cute girl! Cute girl! Cute girl! Cute girl !

00:04:29.575 --> 00:04:32.315
Anything is fine as long as it's a cute girl!

00:04:32.315 --> 00:04:34.575
Though if it's not rare that's not good... but a cute girl!

00:04:34.925 --> 00:04:36.025
A cute girl!

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.220
Well...

00:04:47.465 --> 00:04:48.865
Eh, eh, eh?

00:04:51.965 --> 00:04:53.875
That kid looks like a protagonist

00:04:56.525 --> 00:04:57.565
That one wasn't really that cute....

00:04:59.885 --> 00:05:01.215
Hm.... AH! Ah!

00:05:02.065 --> 00:05:03.075
Cute! What what what...

00:05:03.455 --> 00:05:06.205
Nicori-chan? So cute

00:05:06.205 --> 00:05:08.045
Because she's smiling so she's called Nicori-chan?
(Play on words)

00:05:08.395 --> 00:05:11.245
On top of her head... A mouse? Is there!

00:05:11.245 --> 00:05:12.575
So cute...

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:13.160
Or is it a rabbit?

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:17.815
Ahh, another one came out! This is..

00:05:17.815 --> 00:05:19.015
A big brother or a big sister?

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:20.660
A big sister, probably?

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:21.740
(Screen: It's a boy)

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:24.220
Ohhh, this seems good! She has an impact

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:26.620
It has come

00:05:30.935 --> 00:05:31.935
And the next...!

00:05:33.325 --> 00:05:35.345
Are you an old man?

00:05:35.915 --> 00:05:39.405
Your fan is totally messed up...

00:05:43.175 --> 00:05:44.175
Alright!

00:05:44.215 --> 00:05:46.655
A cute girl has come

00:05:47.795 --> 00:05:51.155
It's definitely come, as expected of me! I have one!

00:05:51.435 --> 00:05:54.275
So with this, my heart is at ease

00:05:55.825 --> 00:05:59.095
Kamurai Tribe... I can do it

00:05:59.095 --> 00:06:01.995
In this game, the most important part is... this!

00:06:02.595 --> 00:06:03.595
Here!

00:06:03.795 --> 00:06:06.825
This looks like practice!

00:06:06.865 --> 00:06:09.395
As I thought, even though they've been gifted the power of the gods...

00:06:09.395 --> 00:06:12.515
If these fighters don't practice daily...

00:06:12.555 --> 00:06:14.785
They won't be able to save the world, right?

00:06:14.785 --> 00:06:17.915
Let's aim high and work hard!

00:06:17.915 --> 00:06:20.945
That's important right? Aiming for the world's number one YouTuber!

00:06:20.945 --> 00:06:23.525
The protagonist should be... well she's cute so...

00:06:23.525 --> 00:06:24.520
Nicori-chan!

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:26.060
It comes with blessings too!

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:29.260
Give me some blessings!

00:06:29.865 --> 00:06:30.865
The receiver is...

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:36.700
Accept these party members...

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:38.420
And let's start the training!

00:06:40.345 --> 00:06:41.345
Ok

00:06:42.035 --> 00:06:43.035
The first one

00:06:44.825 --> 00:06:47.555
I will beat this bird at 4x speed!

00:06:47.555 --> 00:06:49.005
Since I'm a super A.I... so...

00:06:49.325 --> 00:06:52.065
Even if it's 4x speed, I can handle it

00:06:56.545 --> 00:06:57.545
My turn!

00:07:00.565 --> 00:07:03.475
Eh... what should I do? Maybe I should do this after all...

00:07:03.875 --> 00:07:04.875
It should be this...

00:07:05.195 --> 00:07:06.875
Technological strength...

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:09.980
Resistance… Resistance...

00:07:10.155 --> 00:07:12.245
No, it'll have to be leg strength!

00:07:12.765 --> 00:07:15.645
So, since they'll be running and fighting...

00:07:15.645 --> 00:07:17.415
The legs are the most important, right?

00:07:20.745 --> 00:07:22.715
Jump rope, jump rope!

00:07:25.525 --> 00:07:26.460
She's really cute!

00:07:27.105 --> 00:07:30.355
She's got twintails, oh, but she has something on top of her head...

00:07:30.455 --> 00:07:33.755
She has something really close to what I have on my head, right?

00:07:36.565 --> 00:07:37.565
My turn!

00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:40.695
So this time is also...

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:42.660
Leg strength!

00:07:45.525 --> 00:07:46.525
OK!

00:07:58.645 --> 00:08:00.515
Having a rabbit on top of her head is so cute!

00:08:02.355 --> 00:08:04.055
OK! So as before, leg strength!

00:08:05.775 --> 00:08:06.775
Jump, jump, jump!

00:08:07.795 --> 00:08:08.925
Ah, stamina has decreased!

00:08:13.235 --> 00:08:14.285
Stamina has decreased

00:08:17.345 --> 00:08:19.785
Everyone seems to have a really happy smile on their faces

00:08:24.035 --> 00:08:25.035
I wonder if they're hungry?

00:08:27.465 --> 00:08:30.485
Ah she's tired, right? Let's take a rest

00:08:32.095 --> 00:08:35.205
Ok, oh, it recovers instantly, right?

00:08:36.785 --> 00:08:37.785
Ok, ok

00:08:39.965 --> 00:08:42.785
A blessing from the wind?

00:08:42.955 --> 00:08:44.695
Seems she learned a new skill, right?

00:08:45.465 --> 00:08:48.825
Eh, what is this? It's suggesting I do this, so...

00:08:49.075 --> 00:08:50.605
Let's do ninja skills!

00:08:55.195 --> 00:08:56.755
Such a cool big sister

00:08:59.765 --> 00:09:02.185
She learned "Lovely Attack"! Haha!

00:09:02.955 --> 00:09:05.365
Well, she's a cute girl so I'll let you off this time

00:09:06.425 --> 00:09:07.425
Leg strength!

00:09:08.225 --> 00:09:09.455
Let's go, let's go!

00:09:11.675 --> 00:09:14.745
I won't stop the fight...

00:09:14.745 --> 00:09:15.915
Do whatever you like!

00:09:17.725 --> 00:09:19.705
That Guze is a pretty bad guy huh?

00:09:24.935 --> 00:09:25.935
Leg strength, after all

00:09:28.825 --> 00:09:29.825
Ah, the stamina is...

00:09:33.525 --> 00:09:34.525
Stamina has decreased!

00:09:35.795 --> 00:09:36.795
It's been 4 days, right?

00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:38.040
I’ll take a break!

00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:43.680
Eh? What? What? What? What?

00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:46.020
Wow

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:51.580
The average of your teammates are rank G

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:54.920
Alright.... well, it's gonna be F, right?

00:09:55.695 --> 00:09:58.215
Alright, with that being said, let's go straight to a battle!

00:09:58.300 --> 00:10:00.300
That’s my intention, but before that...

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:03.120
The skills... the skills I learned...
*I should equip the skills that I learned before going to battle*

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:04.400
I’ll equip them...
*I should equip the skills that I learned before going to battle*

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:07.280
*I should equip the skills that I learned before going to battle*

00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:08.060
And now...

00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:09.820
I’ll raise the skill’s level

00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:14.460
*You can distribute the skill levels before the battle*

00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:15.500
More power!

00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:19.600
Good

00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:20.960
What else?

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:27.400
*You can also distribute attributes to your liking*

00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:28.240
Good!

00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:30.500
In this case, let’s go with this configuration!

00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:31.660
I LOST!
*Defeat*

00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:32.160
*Defeat*

00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:35.900
Oh! I completed it!

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:38.480
I did it!

00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:41.280
Ah, there's missions, right?

00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:43.460
Ah, how adorable!

00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:45.580
Who is this servant? She’s adorable

00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:48.180
"The Smile dance"

00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:49.760
"The Smile dance"

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:53.160
Since I couldn't win just by training leg strength...

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:54.200
Now I’ll train...

00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:55.620
The basic is important, right?

00:10:55.620 --> 00:10:56.900
I'll do basic training

00:10:57.060 --> 00:10:59.840
Basic training! As soon as you can, make sure to understand the basics

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:00.900
The basics! The basics!

00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:03.300
After all, it’s said that the basics are the most important, right?

00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:04.280
Basic training!

00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:04.780
Yes!

00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:05.940
Basic training!

00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:07.140
Basic training!

00:11:08.780 --> 00:11:09.560
Oh!

00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:16.280
The enemy strength?

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:17.800
I suppose I’ll choose the middle?

00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:23.500
I’ll choose a challenge to reach for Kizuna Ai

00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:27.920
I’ll raise the skill levels...

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:30.860
What would be the best skill?

00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:34.220
"Amazing Rainbow Ball"!

00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:37.300
Good

00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:48.560
Good!

00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:50.400
Now I’ll start the battle!

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:52.360
Well, you know...
*Defeat*

00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:57.140
It definitely is important to make sure to choose a challenge that’s adequate for me, right?

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:00.840
It completed!

00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:04.440
Now that I wasn't taking it seriously...

00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:05.100
I think...

00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:07.140
I’ll win the next challenge

00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:13.940
Ah, it's raining really hard!

00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:17.460
Eh? It’s raining a lot

00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:19.080
Technique training!

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.160
"Here I go"!

00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:22.440
Here I go?

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:25.420
H-here I go?

00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:30.560
Oh! Oh! Oh!

00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:32.320
Hmm...

00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:35.400
Technique training!

00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:37.360
Concentration training

00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:40.560
Oooh!

00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:42.340
"The earth’s blessing"

00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:46.560
Good, again...

00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:48.020
Concentration!

00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:52.620
I wonder if you can see the panties

00:12:53.420 --> 00:12:54.500
Good, well, here...

00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:56.880
I’ll choose a battle that’s at my level

00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:00.840
And now...

00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:03.400
The skills, right?

00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:13.020
Recently, I let the A.I fight for me, but...

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:15.200
It was somewhat out of order, so then...

00:13:15.380 --> 00:13:18.220
I think I’ll demonstrate to you the ideal example

00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:22.660
Good!

00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:25.540
Forward!

00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:29.960
Oh!

00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:32.880
That small one is adorable, right?

00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:39.560
I messed up

00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:40.740
Aaah!

00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:42.520
Ah, I’m good

00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:45.060
No!

00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:46.520
No!

00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:51.480
Good! Ah! Oh! Good job!

00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:53.780
I did it!

00:13:53.780 --> 00:13:54.640
Finally!

00:13:57.100 --> 00:13:57.840
Gooood!

00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:01.760
Good job

00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:05.620
"Lovely attack"!

00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:12.960
Soiyaa!

00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:16.480
Good!

00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:18.100
It's a piece of cake, right?

00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:22.180
Very good!

00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:27.240
Good, good, good, critical!

00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:32.840
Awawa!

00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:37.340
Good! Just one more hir!

00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:41.840
Good! It was a piece of cake, right?

00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:45.540
It was to be expected of me

00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:54.720
It was a piece of cake, right?

00:14:58.420 --> 00:14:59.240
Good!

00:14:59.980 --> 00:15:01.440
Ah, they're adorable when they cry

00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:07.960
The last chapter finally arrived

00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:09.540
Resistance!

00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:12.500
In the end, I was able to fight many consecutive battles

00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:13.720
"I will invite you"

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:16.800
Good!

00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:22.080
Resistance!

00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:24.500
Resistance!

00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:26.740
Eh? Am I in trouble because of my Stamina?

00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:28.980
Ah, I can meditate, right?

00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:31.360
Good, good, good

00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:35.440
And now...

00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:41.160
Maybe this?

00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:45.960
Good! I’m in perfect condition!

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:50.380
"My favorite thing"

00:15:52.060 --> 00:15:53.200
I guess the heart

00:15:54.060 --> 00:15:55.060
The heart

00:15:58.780 --> 00:15:59.740
Oh, oh

00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:04.820
Ah, should I rest?

00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:14.280
Eeeh?

00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:14.900
Eh?

00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:16.220
It looks like... Eh?

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:18.020
It looks like...

00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:19.780
It looks like I’m mistaken...

00:16:19.780 --> 00:16:21.500
I really messed up

00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:22.640
Good!

00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:24.000
In this case, here I go!

00:16:25.220 --> 00:16:26.380
I’m sure that I’ll win

00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:28.060
I can do it, I can do it

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:28.920
What’s this?

00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:30.300
Ah...

00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:31.060
AAAAHHH!?

00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:33.280
Ah?

00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:35.780
Eh...?

00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:40.520
Listen...

00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:42.540
Listen...?

00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:44.160
Isn’t this really unfair?

00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:46.240
Listen...

00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:48.740
Eeehhh? Well...

00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:51.440
I see

00:16:52.020 --> 00:16:54.920
Well, sometimes these things happen, right?

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:57.100
Out of range!

00:16:58.940 --> 00:16:59.900
Eh? Is this the end?

00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:00.900
No! No! No!

00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:02.300
Eh? Eh?

00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:07.700
It looks like it ended

00:17:09.140 --> 00:17:09.920
Eheee?

00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:11.460
Having said that...!

00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:13.800
I finished the training!

00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:15.440
Well, making use of...

00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:19.040
The game letting you choose the level of the battles...

00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:20.840
Make sure...

00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:22.520
To choose an adequate challenge

00:17:22.840 --> 00:17:24.840
It’s the only thing I have to say to you guys

00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:26.960
Oh! Rank F, right?

00:17:27.620 --> 00:17:29.320
I wonder if I raised a bit

00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:30.160
*It’s something good, right?*

00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:32.920
*It’s something good, right?*
(Play on words with "armadillo")

00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:35.180
She’s very good with jokes, right?

00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:37.660
It’s something good, right? ♥

00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:41.020
A.I.Channel

00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:43.300
It turns out that in this game called "Kamurai Tribe"...

00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:45.540
You can read a weekly manga...

00:17:45.700 --> 00:17:48.120
And a manga of each one of the characters

00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:50.920
Have fun reading it and playing the game!

00:17:51.140 --> 00:17:52.560
Man...

00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:55.600
I was thinking that Japanese mythology was fun, but...

00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:58.180
Now I’m also interested in the mythology around the world

00:17:58.740 --> 00:18:00.020
I plan to investigate regarding that...

00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:01.420
So then if you know any interesting history...

00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:03.220
Tell them to me in the comments, yes?

00:18:03.220 --> 00:18:05.620
This was Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai!

00:18:05.860 --> 00:18:06.900
See you later!
