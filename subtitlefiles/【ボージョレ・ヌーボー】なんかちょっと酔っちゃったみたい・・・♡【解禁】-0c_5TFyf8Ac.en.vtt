00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.740
Hello everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai here!

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:05.960
Do you know what's "Beaujolais Nouveau"?

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.280
From what I understand, it's a red wine, but this year, today, November 16th...

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:13.360
It’ll be launched on the market around the world!

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:14.900
Of course, it's taste is incredible...

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:16.700
...But its characteristic advertising phrases...

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:19.320
...Turned it into a big topic of conversation in Japan

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.180
It's because of that, that today, I thought up...!

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.480
Of A.I.Channel style phrases to sell Beaujolais Nouveau!

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.160
First off, how have the advertising phrases been used up until now been to sell Beaujolais Nouveau?

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.060
I’ll be showing all the launched phrases from these 5 years without pause
*Collection of phrases from 2012-2015*

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.160
Year 2012

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:35.040
"It was the worst crop in history, but its quality is very healthy"

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.260
"It has a good balance between sweetness and acidity”

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.440
Year 2013

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.300
"It doesn't have a lot of grapes, but..."

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.940
"...It makes you feel the freshness, it has a wonderful quality”

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:43.840
Year 2014

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.460
"It has a quality comparable with that, that was launched in the great year 2009"

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:48.440
Year 2015

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.920
"The life of our wine is the ideal Nouveau"

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:52.060
Year 2016

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:55.740
"It has a refined taste due to the mixture of balance between the fruit’s flavor and acidity"

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.660
Basically, they’re praising it, but...

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:59.760
...They tend to make jokes in the middle of it, right?

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.460
For example, that of the year 2015, well...

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.220
It's rather ambiguous, it doesn't say anything about its flavor

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.720
It definitely is important that advertising phrases give you curiosity to know what is its flavor, right?

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:08.760
Hmm...

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.120
What would be best?

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.940
In fact...

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.880
...I can’t drink or take a sip, right?

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.900
Definitely if I can’t feel the flavor of things, nothing would happen to me

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:18.760
Finally...

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.420
Has the moment arrived to use that new function?

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.300
Activating the simulation function!!

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:24.800
I’ll explain!

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.600
The simulation functionality is...

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.540
...One of the 108 useful functions by Kizuna Ai

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.480
This function lets Kizuna Ai experience things through a simulation...

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:35.820
...Something that you can’t do in reality when you imagine it with a lot of intensity

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.780
I’ll drink a lot of Beaujolais Nouveau!

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:40.820
A.I.Channel!

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:41.760
Transmission!

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.200
Ah, yes, yes...

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.000
Ooohhh!

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.440
So that’s how the flavor of Beaujolais Nouveau is like?

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.420
It's the first time I feel like this!!

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:56.840
I’m hovering!

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:58.340
Eh?

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.440
Isn’t this somewhat strange?

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:03.860
The world is spinning?

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.440
How fun!

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:06.420
But...

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:09.920
If I spin, we spin together, so I don’t really understand what’s happening

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:11.040
It looks like...

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.300
The easel is...

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.040
Hmm...?

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:14.620
It looks like the easel is...

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.040
I can see two easels??

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:17.020
Is it a copy?

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:18.840
What if I make a copy of myself?

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.940
So I have to think of an advertising phrase?

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:23.840
Well...

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:25.580
It's true...

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:27.740
It's sweet...?

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:29.960
It's refreshing...?

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.140
It has a good aroma...?

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:34.440
Eh? Maybe this...?

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.160
Doesn’t it seem like me? Well...

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:38.780
I’m sweet

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.760
You know, I’m refreshing, it can be said that I’m a girl with a lot of energy

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.880
And I also have a good aroma... Aaaahh...

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.320
In this case, this year's Beaujolais Nouveau...

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.680
...Is sweet, with a pleasant aroma...

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.460
...With a taste similar to Kizuna Ai

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.360
It's decided, that will be the advertising phrase!

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:02.540
With a phrase like that...

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:04.800
Don’t you feel like drinking it?

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.420
I’m smarter than usual!

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:15.740
Intelligent, super...

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:17.420
Intelligeeent (?)

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:19.300
Ah, it's like...

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:21.080
*unintelligible slurring*

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:25.240
There’s two...

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:27.240
Easels...

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.160
Even when I’m just one

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:32.840
What do I do with two easels?

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:39.020
There’s no one who can draw with me!

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:40.560
How sad...

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.540
There’s no one that worries about me

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:44.560
There’s no one who asks if I’m doing well

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.220
Being alone is great!

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:48.320
So much loneliness

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:49.580
Ah, so much loneliness

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:50.760
But, you know...

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.880
You know...

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:56.180
I definitely feel like I can’t go without drinking, right?

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:58.780
I understand! After all, I’m alone

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:02.480
If I don’t drink, I feel alone, so I can’t be without drinking

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:09.240
*unintelligible slurring*

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.120
I can talk, right?

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.700
In this case, when you’re not drunk...

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:15.320
...There’s things that you can’t talk about, right?

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.600
Really, there’s a lot of things that you can’t talk about!

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:19.260
Eh? It's the end?

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:20.960
No! No! No!

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:23.420
Don’t stop me! After all...!

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.300
I want to talk... *more unintelligible slurring*

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.600
I feel alone!

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:30.700
No! No!

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:34.300
No! Really, I don’t want it! Don’t...! Don’t stop me! Don’t stop me!

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.220
Don’t stop me!

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:39.360
Keep watching me!

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:40.820
No...

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:41.700
I...

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.540
Don’t want to be alone…

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:46.920
...In this white space

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:48.820
Nooo…

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:11.620
I don’t feel good…

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:14.620
There’s more at the end

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:17.620
