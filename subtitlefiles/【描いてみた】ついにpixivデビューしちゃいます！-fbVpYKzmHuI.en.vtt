Hello Everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai here!

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:05.495
Everyone, do you remember this?

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:06.520
Techitechi...

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:08.260
Let's make it a Techitechi bird

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:09.720
Okay, it's done!

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:11.500
This is Miratto-chan!

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.800
I've been thinking, since I went out of my way to draw these, I want to be able to sell them somewhere!

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.240
And I've been looking at pixiv lately...

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:23.060
There are a bunch of drawings like this!

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.380
I think pixiv is a wonderful service!

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:32.220
That is to say, don't you want to see me make an account and upload pictures? Genius, right?

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:35.320
With that said, I'm going to draw a new picture for the occasion,

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:39.400
make a pixiv account, and upload it there!

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.520
So, the problem is...

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.060
I was worried while I was making videos before

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:50.860
And while I was watching my previous videos, I realized I was unknowingly using some strange words

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:55.600
...could be. It's like, Cho choi no Choinosuke. Ahahaha...

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.440
What do you think of that! A complete victory!

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.340
Isn't it like, Yoyuu no Yocchan?

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.760
So I think I want to draw Cho choi no Choinosuke and Yoyuu no Yocchan for real!

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:14.080
I'll make the characters and use them as the thumbnail like an eyecatch next time, like, Yoyuu no Yocchan!

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:15.680
So without further delay, let's go!

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.200
First is Cho choi no Choinosuke, right?

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.940
Cho choi no Choinosuke is...

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.280
Mm, yes, to me...

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:32.280
Yoyuu no Yocchan is a lady who has life on easy mode

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.820
So, Cho choi no Choinosuke is...

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.320
kind of like the one she bosses around, right?

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.240
She says "Cho choi no choi!" and turns into a magical girl

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:52.160
She has her hair forcibly tied back

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.340
She has an ahoge

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:56.100
Boi~ng!

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:00.040
And then...

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:03.540
Something like that.

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.560
Since it is all about Chochoi no choi no suke...

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.280
I want it to have something related with “suke”...
(Suke = Assistant)

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.040
I think that a ribbon on her forehead would fit her just good.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:21.260
Like this?

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.060
Wah~ It doesn’t look good~

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:24.060
And then...

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.640
I want it to make you feel like “Ey!”.

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:26.860
And I'll put her...

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.280
A sailor uniform~

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.280
They match! Don’t they?

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.720
I can make her a mini character, right?

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.560
Something like Cho choi no Choinosuke~

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.320
So, like this?

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.540
She also has a magic wand.

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:58.080
Ah, I’ll give it the shape of my ribbon.

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:02.560
Like 2 leaves, right?

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:08.420
Chaaan!

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.380
Cho choi no Choinosuke is complete! Woo!

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:15.880
Definitely, she will be Yoyuu no Yocchan's lifelong servant

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:16.780
However...

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.380
I think Cho choi no Choinosuke is also a masochist

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:22.640
So she's happy deep down! It's a win-win! Isn’t it?

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.280
And next is Yoyuu no Yocchan

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:27.800
Yoyuu no Yocchan is like...

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:29.860
"It's a piece of cake!"

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.620
Let's make her sly and cute

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:37.460
Plushy like a stuffed animal

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:42.260
But when she's just with Cho choi no Choinosuke

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.160
She's like "Hey, you do this!"

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.180
Isn’t it surprising the fact that that’d make men happy?

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:48.140
Don’t you think so?

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:50.280
I wish she’d be showing her forehead.

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:03.500
It’s so hard to draw, isn’t it?

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:09.020
You know, when you’re using colors to draw, it takes a lot of time...

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.280
And it's tough, right?

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:12.280
Amazing.

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:17.300
When I see people drawing me and putting it on Twitter and all sorts of places

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:20.020
It makes me really happy!

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.060
Something like: “I’ll make you say gasp”

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.680
It’s fine like this… I guess?

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:35.520
Yoyuu no Yocchan.

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:39.060
Okay! Yoyuu no Yocchan is done!

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:40.700
She looks... kind of wild

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:42.780
Yoyuu no Yocchan is...

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.560
Even if I don't draw cute girls

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:47.840
I can live my life easy like Yoyuu no Yocchan.

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:49.840
She can do it! It's alright.

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:51.500
I believe in this girl!

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:54.000
Alright! I finished both of them!

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.840
And with that, I want to upload them right away, but...

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.580
I still haven't made an account.

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:02.080
So I'm going to make one right now.

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:03.360
Register now!

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:05.980
Twitter!

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:09.280
This part is a business secret
(Account / Password)

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.620
Alright! I got an account!

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:13.740
And with that, it's posting time!

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:16.340
Ah! Look at this!

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:19.780
Cho choi no Choinosuke is posted!

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:21.640
That’s great~

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:25.640
And now since I've uploaded a work, I'm satisfied!

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:30.580
My name and member ID are right here,

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:32.900
so you can follow me if you want to!

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:38.460
I'll upload more works here, so everyone make sure to follow! Thanks in advance!

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:42.060
This has been Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai! See you!
