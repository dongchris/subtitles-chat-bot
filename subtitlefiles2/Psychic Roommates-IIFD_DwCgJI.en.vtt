Psychic Roommates

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.240
And thanks again for calling Joe's psychic center

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:18.240
Have a good day.

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:20.340
Remember: we're always expecting your call

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.300
Heh, okay bye-bye

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.840
...That's so sad, she's totally going to die...

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:27.820
Hey how was uh...

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:28.800
Crappy

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:31.320
No, I'm working late

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.080
I don't really care, do whatever you want

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:35.660
Are you...?

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:36.540
...mad?

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.920
Why would I be mad?  Oh!

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:41.100
That's right, my roommate's being a selfish

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:42.260
asshole

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.420
Come on... I didn't do anything.  She asked ME to the movies

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.180
You should've said "No," you knew liked her

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:48.620
How was I supposed to know?  You never said anything...

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.180
You're supposed to know because we're freaking psychics man

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.380
Look, you crush on every cute girl you meet

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:58.320
Whatever, have fun

00:00:59.280 --> 00:00:59.780
*Sighs*

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:14.820
You knew I was craving cereal this morning

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:16.880
I did?

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.340
How was I supposed to know?

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.680
You didn't SAY it.  You didn't SAY you wanted cereal this morning....

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:27.540
You know what, I knew that you were going to know that I was going to be craving cereal this morning and that you were going to drink my milk to get back at me

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:28.340
...so I bought a back up!

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:35.440
Well I knew that you would know that I would know that you would want cereal and I would drink the rest of the milk leading you to buy another one, so I drank all of that one, too.

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:42.080
I knew that you were going to know that I was going to know that you were going to know about my back up, so I bought a back up to the back up, and I hid it...

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.700
in the microwave.

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:49.480
Well, I knew that you would know that I knew that YOU knew that I would know about the back up to the back up, so I used all of that one, too.

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.840
...on these!

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:56.100
You know what?  It doesn't matter, because I'm going to use water.

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.320
You're going to use water on your cereal?

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.160
Okay...that's disgusting.

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:11.000
This is ridiculous

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.680
Look, I'm sorry for saying "Yes" to Rebecca, okay?

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:16.240
I'll call her.

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:17.620
I'm going to tell her I'm not going to go.

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.860
Is that what you want?  Will that make you happy?

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:23.280
*Sighs*

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:26.140
No...

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.200
No...that wouldn't make me happy

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.660
That would make me...non happy

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.600
*Sighs* Look it just...it just stings okay?  Not being the one that's chosen

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:41.400
You know what I want?

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.460
I want you to go.  You should go and have a good time.

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:47.960
You should go

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:50.720
What's the point?

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.160
What do you mean?

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.220
I mean, we're going to have a great time at the movies

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:59.020
...and then I'm going to ask her out to dinner next week...

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.760
We're going to go to California Pizza Kitchen and coincidentally order the same thing

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.560
We'll connect over similar taste in music and

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.500
our desire to give back to the community

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:11.540
That's going to lead to two more romantic dates, we're going to have our first kiss in three weeks

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:12.640
become exclusive in two months

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.700
I'll meet her parents in five months and we're going to say "I love you" to each other for the first time in seven months

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:21.500
For the following five months, we're going to get comfortable, take each other for granted

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:28.520
And after our one year anniversary, she's going to get promoted and start working late nights with a coworker "Anderson," who used to be a model for a semi-notable men's fashion magazine.

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.780
Two months after that, she's going to come home and tell me that...

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.420
She still loves me but she's not *in love* with me.

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:44.720
(Crying) Okay?  Then I'm going to find out that she's been doing more than just working late nights with Anderson, the model who used to work for a semi-notable men's fashion magazine...

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:45.980
What's the point??

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.200
...going to break my heart.

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.180
Stupid...

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:02.480
Come on

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:04.240
You don't KNOW that

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.720
Yes I do, we're freakin' psychics, dude.

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:08.660
Right...

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:14.600
Look Joe

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:18.320
You're a...really...good guy who...

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.920
super cool and smart and successful

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:24.820
Look, you got your own your like...small business and...

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:32.720
I have to go sit in that booth everyday and still wear this stupid thing

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:37.740
Do you know why I...ask you to always hang out?

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:42.500
It's 'cause when we go out, you make ME look cooler.

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:44.400
Really?

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:45.400
Yeah

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:50.160
Look, I know it's really cliche

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.600
but there are plenty of fish in the sea

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:57.720
You're going to find someone else

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:02.220
Her name is Susan, she's...
(together) an interior decorator.
Yeah, I saw that too

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:05.060
I'll get it

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:06.420
*Doorbell rings*

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:11.580
Hi!
Hey

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:14.160
Is Joe home?  I'm picking him up for the movie.

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:16.820
Yeah, look about that Rebecca, um...

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:19.780
Joe can't really talk right now um...

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:21.040
You've really hurt him

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:21.680
What?

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:25.620
I mean, he hopes that you guys can still be friends after all this

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:29.660
but I think what he needs from you right now is just a little bit of space

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:32.360
Uh...(half-laughs)

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:42.220
And I actually that what YOU should do is take this time and think about what...YOU did

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:43.640
er...will do

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:46.260
I hope Anderson's worth it

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:49.160
Who the hell is "Anderson"?

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:51.060
(from far away) Oh you know who he is!
