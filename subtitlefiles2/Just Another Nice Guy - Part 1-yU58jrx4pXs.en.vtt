00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:10.440
Oh.

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:14.000
Did she just say, "Oh"?

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:16.500
Oh.

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.000
Oh my God. She said it again.

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:20.800
I'm gonna be sick.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:22.560
Oh...

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:25.660
[half speed] Oh...

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:28.500
[slow motion] Oh...

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.860
[gag reflex]

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.800
Okay so, I swear there's a very
good reason as to why

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:36.200
this simple word is having
such a strong effect on my gag reflex.

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.020
I guess it all started
about six months ago with... this picture.

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:41.240
[shutter]

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.940
Let me see?

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:44.740
Perfect. Yeah, send that to me.

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:46.800
That's definitely going out
on all the campus social media.

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.940
Oh, no. I look so weird.

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.640
My smile is so derpy.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.200
I think you have a great smile.

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:54.940
I'm gonna be over there...

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:57.920
-Derek.
-Audrey.

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.100
I'm guessing you're not going
to want this photo then?

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.800
[chuckle] If you want,
you can tag me as a photographer

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:06.000
and I'll take the blame
for your derpy smile. [laughs]

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:07.000
Actually...

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.800
it started four years before...
with this picture.

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:10.800
[shutter]

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:12.900
Whoa!

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.280
That's so cool!

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:16.320
That's Jocelyn.

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.740
I had the biggest crush on her
since eighth grade.

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:19.800
[giggles]

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.700
[Kristen] We doing a photoshoot over here?

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.160
Oh, let's take one with Kristen.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:24.700
I didn't like Kristen.

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:26.640
Yeah, sure.
[nervous chuckle]

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.700
Aw, you guys are so cute,
you look like a couple.

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.760
Don't say that.
That'd be like dating my brother.

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:36.120
[shutter]

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:38.880
I'll never forget that moment.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.600
And not because I literally have it
frozen in time on a Polaroid but,

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:46.300
because you never forget
when you realize exactly who you are

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.060
and where you are to the person you like.

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:53.800
[laughs] In case you missed that,
she just put you in the friend zone.

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:55.400
I'm sorry, Derek.

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.920
I mean, you're really cool
but you're... just a nice guy.

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.800
That's where it all clicked.
I knew I heard that line from somewhere.

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.400
[typing]

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.220
[laughs] That's gross.

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.480
-It's like dating my brother.
-What!

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.800
I remember watching
that video years before

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.540
and not really thinking much about it.

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.500
Seemed like being a nice guy
was this terrible label no one wanted.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.600
I mean, they've even made songs about it.

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.600
♪ Nice guys finish last... ♪

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.500
But now because of Jocelyn,
all those stories and songs made sense.

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:33.800
I was just another...

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:35.000
Nice Guy.

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.920
And going to college
only solidified who I was.

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:40.000
I liked helping out friends.

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.600
Thank you so much, Derek,
for helping me post flyers.

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:45.700
Yeah, no problem.

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.000
I enjoyed listening to problems.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.100
[crying] I just don't know why
it'd say something like that, you know?

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.500
That's terrible!

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:57.840
I enjoyed jump-starting cars,

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:59.300
and sharing last semesters' notes,

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.000
and hanging out in big groups.

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:04.200
Nacho cheese. [laughter]

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.060
But I firmly believed that,

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.480
just because I was a nice guy
that didn't mean I had to finish last.

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:13.000
Right?

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:14.900
I mean all those videos and songs,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.500
they all ultimately said guys like me
could still have a happy ending,

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.960
and get the girl
as long as I played my cards right.

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:22.500
So when I met Audrey,

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:26.240
I made sure that I didn't fall
into a standard nice guy traps.

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.100
I didn't talk about other girls around her.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.100
Hey Derek, I need a picture
over here with these guys.

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:33.960
Oh I think Julia is calling for you.

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:35.160
Who's Julia?

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:36.560
[Julia] Derek!

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:38.420
I made sure we hung out one-on-one.

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.320
Oh! Hey, do you think I could invite
my cousin, Sandra, to the movies?

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:43.100
She's always asking me
to take her out.

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.800
Ooh, uh, it's sold out.
Uh, we got the last two tickets.

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.440
Oh okay. I can just tell her
to meet us to eat yogurt after.

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:52.500
Ooh, that's sold out, too.
We're getting the last two cups.

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:54.600
-How is that even possible?
-Seat belts!

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:57.700
I gave her space so that
she would look forward to seeing me.

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:00.900
So, how's your new job at that store?

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.120
I feel like we haven't
caught up in a while.

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.460
Really? Has it been that long?
(5 days, 13 hours, 48 minutes)

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.560
It's great, I can't complain.
How are you doing?

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.940
I avoided that friend ladder at all costs.

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:16.600
Uh-- Can you help me get this in the car?
My cousin, Sandra, needs to borrow it.

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:18.980
I generally avoided
all ladders around her.

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:20.900
Nah, I'm good!

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:23.200
What?

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.500
And from what I gathered,
it seemed like it was working.

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:29.400
We were getting closer,
we had great chemistry,

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:33.500
and it felt like...
she was feeling something, too.

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:38.820
Which brings us back to my gag reflex
which is currently in overdrive.

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:43.000
You see, tonight was my defining moment
as a nice guy.

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.000
I finally worked up the courage
to tell Audrey,

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:50.200
my friend, a girl of my dreams,
that I had feelings for her.

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:53.500
A lot of us out there know what it's like
to be in this position.

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:55.700
To put it all on the line.

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:58.540
And we all hope that
it'll go something like this:

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:01.600
I just had to tell you, I like you.

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:03.500
More than a friend.

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:06.860
Wow. I'm so glad
you said something, Derek.

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:09.380
I feel the same way. Let's make out.

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:13.500
And if that's too optimistic, at least:

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:16.500
I just had to tell you, I like you.

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:18.200
More than a friend.

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:21.000
Gosh. What a surprise.

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:24.000
You know, I'm not really ready
to process this right now,

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:25.400
but I definitely am open

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:28.800
to exploring the possibility
of us being in a romantic relationship.

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:30.420
Let's hug tenderly.

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:34.240
I mean, was that too much to ask?

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:38.400
But instead, after burying my soul
and revealing my deepest emotions,

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:42.540
I get the one word that everyone dreads
to hear in this defining moment.

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:45.600
Oh.

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:50.700
It's amazing how much can be said
with just these two letters.

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:52.900
She started saying a bunch of other stuff

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.340
that I'm sure it was very kind
and sugar-coated,

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:58.380
but all I heard was, "Oh",

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:00.000
which basically meant:

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:02.240
This is awkward.

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:04.580
How could you misread my intentions?

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:07.080
Why would you ruin our friendship?

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:08.600
Thanks, but no thanks.

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:12.600
You are and forever will be,
a nice guy, Derek.

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:15.800
I'm not into you that way,
and there's nothing you can do about it.

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:18.700
Derek?

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:20.540
Say something.

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:24.200
Did you hear what I said?

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:27.240
Yeah, uh, I heard everything.

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:31.000
So... we can still be friends?

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:33.900
Yeah, of course.

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:37.480
You know I... care about you a lot.

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:42.700
I should take you home now.

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:55.300
This was the worst car ride of my life.

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:57.200
And I've been in two accidents,

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:02.160
but at least in those cases it was just
my car being destroyed and not my heart.

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:07.400
Complete silence. The whole way.

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:12.160
We were only three feet apart
but it felt like three miles.

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:16.100
Every inch of me wanted to scream out
how much this sucked.

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:18.440
To ask her, why?

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.800
Why she didn't see me that way.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.600
Why she couldn't give me a chance.

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:26.500
I did everything right,
but was it all a lie?

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:29.200
All the videos, all the advice,

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:32.500
all the fluffy BS that said
being nice pays off.

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:35.140
It was all boiling inside of me,

00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:38.700
but I kept it in and sat there in silence.

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:44.040
And then I realize
that's what a nice guy would do.

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:45.700
[tire screeches]

00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:47.700
Oh my God! What are you doing?

00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:49.900
Were you using me?

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:51.540
What?

00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:55.300
Were you using me-- my niceness,
just to get what you wanted?

00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:57.500
Are you serious?

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:00.460
That's what all you girls do.

00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:04.100
You see a nice guy like me
and you take advantage of it.

00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:08.500
Using us to confide in,
to help with errands,

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:13.300
be a good friend but...
never anything more.

00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:19.400
So, are you saying you were just
being nice to get me to like you?

00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:20.840
What's wrong with that?

00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:23.200
Because you weren't being genuine.

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:26.500
I genuinely liked you.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.500
So, now because I don't feel the same way
you're not gonna be nice to me anymore?

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:32.680
You're not gonna to be my friend?

00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:35.500
I don't know. What's the point?

00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:40.960
I can't believe you think that just 
because you were nice to me, I owe you...

00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:42.820
a relationship.

00:08:43.660 --> 00:08:45.140
At least a chance.

00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:47.360
Wow.

00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:49.900
You know, if you were upset
that I turned you down

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.300
because you were just a nice guy,
trust me, that's not the case.

00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:56.700
You're so far from that.

00:08:57.460 --> 00:08:59.740
Where are you going?
We're still so far from your place.

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:01.400
I'd rather walk.

00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:02.500
Audrey.

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:04.940
Audrey. Audrey!

00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:10.160
[sighs] Okay.

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:12.900
Now, it's the worst car ride of my life.

00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:20.100
