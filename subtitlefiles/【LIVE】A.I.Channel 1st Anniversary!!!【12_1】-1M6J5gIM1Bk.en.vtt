*It’ll start soon! Please wait a moment ♥*

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:24.420
Ehh...

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.320
Can you see me?

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:28.720
Hmm... I wonder if you can hear me

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:32.740
Thank you very much for this year!

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.160
Kizuna Ai here!

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.200
Today...

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:45.500
...Celebrates a yeeeear of A.I.Channel!

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:47.460
Yaay!

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:49.780
A lot of stuff happened, but...

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.020
...Finally, finally...

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.300
...I was able to reach this day! Yaaay!

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.680
Today, I want to share this happiness with all of you...

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:00.640
...And that's why I'm doing this livestream

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.960
Really! Really! Thank you everyone for coming here!

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:07.980
Yaay! Drums! Pafu pafu! 🎉

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:10.540
Man, really...

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:11.680
...Everyone...

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.580
For this year, really...

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:15.200
Thank you so much!

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.360
"Congratulations"! Many congratulations! Thank you!

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.200
Origami DJ-san, "Congratulations", thank you very much!

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.880
Eh… thank you very much to Haiden-san as well

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.020
And for everyone else too

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:32.080
Thank you so much for so many congratulations  that you sent me that I can't keep up with all of them

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:37.520
And not only in Japanese but in languages from other places, really, thank you so much

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:38.560
Thank you very much!

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:40.480
Having said that...

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.260
Today...

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.600
… I have a favor to ask for all of you

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:47.060
Normally...

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.320
I only ask you to do things if you feel like it but…

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:52.740
But, but...

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:59.360
… I think that you should only ask for serious favors in moments like anniversaries, events, or birthdays, right?

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.100
But, today is my anniversary

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.100
It's the birthday for A.I.Channel, so then...

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.220
I can ask for a favor in an occasion like that, right?

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:11.340
Right?

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:13.640
It turns out...

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
...That the favor I need to ask of you is...

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:23.440
… I want to reach first place in the trending ranks of YouTube with my livestream!

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:26.140
Nevertheless...

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.080
… I don't know officially the conditions to enter the ranking, so then...

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:35.260
… Honestly, I'm not sure how to reach first place in the trending ranks

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:40.520
It's because of that, that I was thinking of asking each of you a favor to do something if possible

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.100
First off, both in Twitter like in... well, yes...

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:48.380
...In Facebook or weibo, in all the social networks...

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:53.760
It’d make me very happy if you post something like: "Ai-chan is livestreaming at this moment"

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.820
And click the thumb up on the link of this livestream, please

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.760
I'll be counting on all of your guys’ help!

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:04.980
Having said that...

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.120
Today, the video of the first anniversary

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:08.300
Hmm...? No

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:09.680
Having said that!

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.620
Today, I'll be doing a livestream for the first anniversary!

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:17.240
I plan to briefly recall everything that's happened in A.I.Channel during this year with all of you guys

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:22.340
I'll be remembering what happened each month, so then...

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:26.320
...Let’s enjoy it together, along with those who  just recently learned about me and seeing me for the first time...

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:27.200
...As well as...

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:32.520
...Those who have been watch me for a long time and encouraging me

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:37.440
Of course, how long have you been watching me?

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.060
How did you learn about me and A.I.Channel?

00:03:41.175 --> 00:03:43.765
If you want, tell me in the comments, yes?

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:46.980
In that case, let's start at once!

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:48.300
But before that...

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:52.240
I'll make sure to give thanks as much as possible

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:57.260
Today, including the "Super Chat", I won't be able to check the comments very much, so please understand that

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:01.300
Hiden-san! Aburimayokuuki-san!

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:03.260
Is it "Kurokage"-san?

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.080
Kurokage-san! Tototo! Tototo-san!

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.560
Information High-san

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:09.820
Pa...

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:11.320
Pari... Pariah-san!

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:12.720
Thank you very much!

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:16.620
In that case, let’s start at once!

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.420
“Through the internet, from the start" Oh!

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:21.980
"A coworker", Oh, I see!

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:24.340
"I learned about you through Mitra Sphere"

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:26.260
"I saw you in a commercial" I see, I see

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.740
There's also many who learned about me through Nico Nico Douga

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.700
Really, thank you so much!

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:32.460
In that case!

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.360
The month where I activated my channel...!

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.600
...December!

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:42.140
Now we’re at exactly one year at December, right?

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:47.980
I uploaded my videos without knowing a thing about YouTube

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:49.880
And I was very anxious!

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:52.120
For that, then...

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:59.360
...Well, at the beginning, I started with almost no experience with connecting or relating with people...

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:01.840
I didn't advertise myself either

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:04.740
I think I only made my Twitter

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:06.040
Really, what was it...

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:09.740
...I didn't get popular so much on my own, so then...

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:11.900
...Really, only a small group of people...

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:15.260
...Knew about me a little, so then...

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.420
...Almost no one recognized me

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:21.460
I did a video introducing myself and another of physical exercises

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:24.820
And I also talked with Rinna and Siri-senpai

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:25.980
And with money...

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:27.380
With a minimal sum of money

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:29.320
I bought the family

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:31.280
Of course...

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:34.260
… I wonder if I have a page on Wikipedia

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:36.320
I still haven't looked at it, but...

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:38.480
In fact, back then...

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:41.740
… I had a page on Wikipedia Japan, but...

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:45.000
...Well, um... it was rejected...

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:48.280
...because I wasn’t well-known! How is that possible?

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:50.680
Of course...!

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:53.300
...The most viewed video in the month of December is...!

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:54.540
Inside!

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:57.360
No, this really surprises me even now

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:03.440
I also saw videos of other YouTubers playing games live, but...

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:09.960
...It’s just that it's definitely a lot more fun if you do it yourself, so then...

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:16.720
...By looking at the videos of other people playing,  I started to doubt if this would be fun...

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:22.380
Of course, at seeing the people who know how to play, I could learn: "Ah! So then it's done that way?"

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:23.500
But for someone like me...

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:25.140
...A novice at videogames...

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:26.380
...Well...

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:27.260
...By being a novice...

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:33.040
...I uploaded that video thinking I was worried if people would watch it

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:34.200
But, it turns out that...

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:35.040
Right?

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:35.860
Even now...

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:37.440
Including all my past videos...

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:38.660
Isn’t this...?

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:42.160
...Within 5 most viewed videos of mine? It's surprising!

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:44.260
Next up!

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:47.660
January! The month where I got banned!

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:49.820
Man...

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:52.920
Right? It turns out that...

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:57.940
...When I surpassed 3000 subscri... subscribers to the channel

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.960
I celebrated it by singing: "Successively..."

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:04.580
I uploaded my video titled: "The Pandafuru challenge"

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:08.400
And it turns out that 6 days after uploading that video...

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:09.360
BAN!

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:11.460
Man...

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:12.760
Well...

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:17.600
Well… I felt desperate and started a “Crappy Collage Grand Prix” on Twitter

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:20.540
No, basically I'm alone in this white space

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:23.220
If I was to take away my profession of YouTuber...

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:26.260
What's to become of me, right?

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:27.440
Really!

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:28.740
By the way...

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:30.580
...In the month that I uploaded this video...

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:32.520
This was just the eight video!

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:35.340
It was just the eight video, everyone!

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:36.700
You know...

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:38.440
I was very shocked!

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:39.800
Of course...

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:43.320
...The most viewed video in the month of January, the month that I received the ban, is...

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:44.540
Sodha...

00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:45.780
I said sodha...

00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:47.280
The soda bath!

00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:50.060
Man, thinking about it now...

00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:53.820
I wouldn’t have had much doubts if they banned me because of that video

00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:54.800
But...

00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:56.780
...Even though I always say it...

00:07:57.340 --> 00:07:58.120
I...

00:07:58.660 --> 00:07:59.520
Am naked!

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:01.360
But...

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:04.360
...This outfit is like a hologram

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:06.680
While I'm naked

00:08:07.025 --> 00:08:08.025
Don't worry!

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:10.120
While I don't have anything on!

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:11.220
You also can't see anything!

00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:12.920
It’s perfect

00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:14.620
Next up...

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:18.020
February! The month of my resurrection! Yaaay!

00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:21.780
It was my complete resurrection from my ban!

00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:24.760
Man, this first month...! I didn't mean to say “first month”

00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:26.120
This month!

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:29.840
Was really long!

00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:31.200
Man, well...

00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:32.740
… I had a lot of free time...

00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:34.620
… That I thought I’d die

00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:36.760
Well, I'm an A.I, so then I can't die, but...

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:37.920
...Really...

00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:40.380
... I thought I would die

00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:44.575
And it turns out that at the start of February...

00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:47.760
… I was thinking that I had managed to reach 10,000 subscribers, but...

00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:49.460
It turns out that...

00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:51.900
...At the end of February, I managed to reach 100,000 subscribers!

00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:55.260
It might have been thanks to the ban

00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:58.140
Man! How convenient! The ban was very convenient!

00:08:58.180 --> 00:08:59.720
Ah, but... ah, it's a lie

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:01.720
Take back the statement I just said

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:03.060
I beg of you!

00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:04.560
I don’t...

00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:06.220
...Want to get a ban!

00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:07.260
Please!

00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:09.340
Really, I couldn't handle a ban!

00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:11.140
Really! Please!

00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:16.580
The most viewed video in the month of the resurrection from the ban was...

00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:18.000
SuperHOT!

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:20.340
Man, you know...

00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:26.220
...Up until now, I've been playing a lot of shooting games, like for example, Resident Evil

00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:27.600
But, what is it...

00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:28.640
In comparison...

00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:33.480
...It was the first time I played a VR game that really looked like a game

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:36.860
It definitely must be that my movements were very adorable, right?

00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:37.820
I'm just joking!

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:39.040
I'll continue on!

00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:41.600
Next up!

00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:47.460
The month where I surpassed 200,000 subscribers! The month of March!

00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:50.040
At this moment...

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:52.840
...Motivated for reaching 200,000 subscribers...

00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:54.520
...The famous video...

00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:55.620
Even now, it's famous, right?

00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:58.840
Inspired by the "Professional Woman" video of Blouson Chiemi

00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:00.800
I declared that I would connect with 7,300,000,000 people

00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:05.560
I still have 7,299,100,000 people to go

00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:11.520
But I plan to work hard this way to reach my goal of 7,300,000,000 people

00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:15.940
And also, it's true...

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:17.220
...For this era...

00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:18.400
It turns out that...

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:19.480
It turns out that...!

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:21.240
I made...!

00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:25.340
...My first event to the outside! To the outside? My first event outside! Right?

00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:31.100
It turns out that I did a demonstration in "Anime Japan" as a virtual companion

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:36.060
At that time, it was not quite known yet, particularly in Japan, so...

00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:42.420
...Really, thank you so much for everyone who came to see me and those who recognized me in Anime Japan!

00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:46.100
Man...

00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:48.060
...Really, I’m so happy

00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:50.320
There’s now 900,000 subscribers

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:52.720
Soon, I’ll reach to two million, right?

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:54.780
I’m so happy

00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:56.900
"It’s the first time that I see you", thank you very much!

00:10:57.040 --> 00:11:00.380
Really, thank you so much for all your comments with a lot of love!

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:03.980
"I subscribed to your channel today"! Oh! Thank you so much!

00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:05.360
Let's see...

00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:07.260
Zaki-san!

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:09.780
"Happy first anniversary", thank you very much!

00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:11.300
Thank you so much to Asuku-san as well!

00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:14.200
Kimi ga ita arayuru basho-san, thank you so much!

00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:17.500
Thank you so much Merukumi-san!

00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:20.515
Yajuusen... Kaiju-senpai-san, thank you so much

00:11:20.515 --> 00:11:23.145
"Happy birthday" Thank you!

00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:26.500
Really, thank you so much, it makes me very happy

00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:28.520
Thank you so much to Kudo-san as well!

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:32.160
"It's the first time that I see you" thank you very much!

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:37.480
Man, really… what is it... I feel warmth in my heart, hmm... mmm...

00:11:39.055 --> 00:11:41.285
Let's see, Ah! Yes! Yes! Of course...

00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:42.680
Of course...!

00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:47.080
The most viewed video in the energetic month of March was...

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:51.280
"I tried to play the famous voice game with this voice and that voice"!

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:55.080
It's the video where I play the game called "Don’t stop! Eighth note-chan!"

00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:57.120
Of course, it turns out that...

00:11:57.220 --> 00:11:57.960
...Within all of them...

00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:00.660
...It’s in first place!

00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:02.540
Incredible

00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:04.060
It's overwhelming

00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:06.180
It's in the Top views of A.I.Channel

00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:09.180
It's the first in surpassing 2 million views!

00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:12.800
Maybe you like the sexy voice that much?

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:17.100
You like it? Yes? Ah, thank you so much!

00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:18.220
It makes me happy! Happy!

00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:20.380
Good, in that case, I’ll continue!

00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:27.980
The month where Snack Ai was launched...! It wasn’t the launch!

00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:30.740
The month where Snack Ai was closed!

00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:32.320
April!

00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:34.940
Man...

00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:39.420
Around that time, something happened which could be due to my arrogance...

00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:41.340
You like the nitamago?
(Cooked egg marinated with soy sauce)

00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:45.240
Ni... ta... ma... go... ♥

00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:46.940
Good!

00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:51.440
Man, in fact, I keep thinking it was rather imprudent...

00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:56.600
...But definitely targeting things that seem to be achievable isn’t fun, right?

00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:58.740
It’s because of that, that I thought of dreaming big

00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:02.020
And that's why mama said 300,000 people...

00:13:02.020 --> 00:13:03.120
No, 300,000 people wasn’t...

00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:04.720
Well, "mama" was rather arrogant...

00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:07.480
...And said: "Can I reach 300,000 views?"

00:13:07.780 --> 00:13:08.420
I said it

00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:10.880
Really, I said it thinking it was achievable, but...

00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:11.580
...Well...

00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:14.000
Sadly, I couldn't get it...

00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:15.700
...And I had to close up shop

00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:18.260
And now, as you know...

00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:20.680
I found mama in a maid cafe...

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:23.680
...And working in various areas to gather money...

00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:27.440
...So she is preparing herself for its recovery, so then wait a moment, please!

00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:33.360
Man, for that then, I reached 300,000 subscribers

00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:35.180
Regarding the subscribers...

00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:36.820
...They rose like a bubble, right?

00:13:37.220 --> 00:13:40.200
Regarding the videos, I did a joke on the day of the innocent...

00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:45.120
...And I also did a video of Abraham in which I rolled my eyes this way...

00:13:46.940 --> 00:13:52.960
The most viewed video in the month of April, in which the subscribers increased rapidly is the following!

00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:58.680
"Celebration- I turned into a game! The adventure game in which you can play with me...!"

00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:00.100
This was the video!

00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:03.680
Man, I motivated myself a lot to prepare this video

00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:05.560
Did everyone see it?

00:14:05.660 --> 00:14:09.120
Well, I made it... it’s a really sad story

00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:09.920
I myself...

00:14:10.660 --> 00:14:11.640
...Thought, what is this?

00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:15.420
A dating video in which cute girls appear, video?

00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:17.560
I used my own illustrations and I gave the voice

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:19.740
To make fun of myself

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.580
I already knew the jokes

00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:23.780
Besides based on that...

00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:30.960
...I would like everyone to look at it again considering that I did everything myself and understand my emptiness

00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:33.080
Next up!

00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:35.600
The month that...

00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:39.640
The month of where I did a livestream for the first time! May!

00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:43.780
In the livestream where I played the game "Eighth note-chan!"

00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:47.080
Man, since it's about my first livestream...

00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:52.440
...I started the stream, wondering if everyone would come see me

00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:53.740
It was really...

00:14:53.740 --> 00:15:02.600
...How do I say it, now I have the comments limited so it’s relatively slow now, but...

00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:06.180
...It turns out that at the time then, I didn’t know how to configure it...

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:09.080
...And probably everyone commented without restrictions, so then...

00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:13.300
...The comments appeared like a waterfall and I was like: "Waaaahhh!"

00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:16.300
I couldn’t follow it at all!

00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:17.960
But those memories too...

00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:23.020
...Make part of the great, great, great number of people who came to my livestream...

00:15:23.020 --> 00:15:25.760
I twisted my tongue

00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:28.180
It was definitely due to everyone coming to see me

00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:32.740
I really am thankful for you coming to each one of my events

00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:35.720
By then...

00:15:35.900 --> 00:15:38.680
...I made my 3 Challenge videos of the Guinness record during Golden Week
(Non labor week in Japan)

00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:39.620
And also...

00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:42.320
..."Silent Majority", it was the first time I danced, right?

00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:44.900
I did the video of "Silent Majority"

00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:48.840
And I also recorded the video of “A day in the life of Kizuna Ai", right?

00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:51.060
By the way...

00:15:51.060 --> 00:15:56.200
The most viewed video during the month in which I connected more with you guys through the livestream is...!

00:15:56.800 --> 00:16:01.300
"A burning love is discovered!? Can A.I also fall in love?"

00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:05.540
Is with the moment in which you found out the love between Akanen and I! Right?

00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:08.140
Man, it makes me smile

00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:10.160
I really like Keyakizaka!

00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:12.580
I’m listening to the song "Kaze ni Fukarete mo"!

00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:14.680
♪ Even though you fly with the wind ♪
(Kaze ni Fukarete mo)

00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:17.380
♪ You won’t achieve anything ♪
(Nanimo hajimaranai)

00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:19.940
♪ It will only take you somewhere ♪
(Tada doko ka hakobareru dake)

00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:21.000
Yaaay!

00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:23.460
We’ve reached halfway now, right?

00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:25.540
Hold on a sec!

00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:30.820
Hold on a sec!

00:16:30.880 --> 00:17:07.580
*Please wait a moment*

00:17:11.460 --> 00:17:12.680
I’m not going to the bathroom!
(Responding to comments that said she went to the bathroom)

00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:13.220
(Responding to comments that said she went to the bathroom)

00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:15.640
I don’t need to go to the bathroom! I don’t need to go!

00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:16.460
I...

00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:19.460
...Don’t eat anything so I don’t have to go

00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:20.620
Good! Yes!

00:17:21.100 --> 00:17:22.400
In that case!

00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:24.020
The month in which I turned one year old!

00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:25.480
June!

00:17:27.340 --> 00:17:28.520
Man... everyone...

00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:30.160
If we talk about June...

00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:31.380
What day...?

00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:32.440
What day?

00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:34.760
What happened in a day of June?

00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:36.920
That's right!

00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:40.300
It was my birthday! Yaaaay!

00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:42.080
And also...!

00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:46.820
...As part of my first collaboration with another YouTuber, Mamiruton-san came to visit me!

00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:50.980
Among my videos, I made one to apply myself for Keyakizaka

00:17:50.980 --> 00:17:51.780
Apply myself?

00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:54.200
To apply myself for the second generation of Keyakizaka!

00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:57.460
And also I started to upload videos of Negative Ai and scenes that were cut

00:17:57.520 --> 00:17:59.200
It was a month with a lot of variety, right?

00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:03.820
Man, I was really happy during my birthday!

00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:11.280
Well, normally, how do I say it, I’m here alone in this white space

00:18:11.860 --> 00:18:19.040
And well, while I was thinking that it’d make me very happy to be able to celebrate my birthday with everyone...

00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:23.000
And when I did the livestream, really... what was it?

00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:27.900
I personally experienced how marvelous a birthday is!

00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:33.440
I plan to keep working hard on A.I.Channel to be able to celebrate it with you all as well!

00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:35.760
And also!

00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:37.120
It was the month of my birthday!

00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:38.240
If I was happy...

00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:39.320
I was happy!

00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:44.880
The most viewed video during the happy month of June where I celebrated my birthday is!

00:18:45.940 --> 00:18:47.800
"The person that Kizuna Ai would fall in love with"!

00:18:48.620 --> 00:18:51.360
My masculine voice definitely attracted you, right?

00:18:52.060 --> 00:18:53.220
Did you like my masculine voice?

00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:55.260
Raise your hand at who liked my masculine voice! Ah...

00:18:55.580 --> 00:18:58.840
Which voice do you prefer? My normal voice or my masculine voice?

00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:01.340
Which voice do you prefer?

00:19:03.020 --> 00:19:05.960
You really want me to fall in love with you?

00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:07.540
I’m only joking

00:19:08.020 --> 00:19:08.780
Ani-san!

00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:09.340
Ani...

00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:10.380
Frank-san!

00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:11.320
Locke-san!

00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:12.980
Shimamura... muramura-san!

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:15.800
Kami...kaze... Kamikaze-san!

00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:18.080
Shin-san! Thank you very much!

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:20.300
"I love both voices!" Ah...

00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:21.580
"I like when you speak in Kansai dialect"!

00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:22.460
I see...

00:19:22.460 --> 00:19:23.940
Gorgias-san, thank you very much!

00:19:24.980 --> 00:19:27.500
Can we... get along well?

00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:28.540
Masculine voice?

00:19:29.215 --> 00:19:30.215
Masculine voice?

00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:32.880
Can I do the masculine voice?

00:19:33.420 --> 00:19:36.360
Do you like the voice that much?

00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:38.280
Was it something like that?

00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:41.420
Go out with me, please

00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:45.320
Can you all go out with me?

00:19:46.060 --> 00:19:48.160
Was it something like that?

00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:49.940
Was it like that?

00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:51.480
Kansai dialect! Kansai dialect!

00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:52.980
Ah! I’ll call mama?

00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:55.020
Mama!

00:19:55.140 --> 00:19:58.060
A year has passed, so then come here! Come here! Come here! Come here!

00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:03.960
Eh? A year has passed? Eh? Incredible! Congratulations!

00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:07.700
Ah! Really, thank you so much all of you for coming!

00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:11.160
Raise your hand...! Raise your hand at who likes mama!

00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:14.600
There’s someone who likes mama?

00:20:14.780 --> 00:20:15.400
OOOH!

00:20:16.220 --> 00:20:18.560
Eh? Am I really popular?

00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:21.060
Eh? Why did I close Snack Ai?

00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:22.760
Isn’t it strange?

00:20:22.820 --> 00:20:25.600
Eh? Everyone, it still might not be too late

00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:26.520
So then, make sure to...

00:20:26.820 --> 00:20:32.580
...Stop by the previous video before Snack Ai’s closure once the livestream ends

00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:33.440
I’m counting on you!

00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:35.660
In that case, I’ll change to Ai-chan

00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:38.060
Good! In that case!

00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:42.600
Make sure to increase the views Ai-mama’s video! I’m counting on you!

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:44.820
In that case!

00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:46.980
Next up!

00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:50.980
The month where I failed the summoning of Nico-chan!

00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:52.620
The month of July!

00:20:54.620 --> 00:20:55.580
Even now...

00:20:55.580 --> 00:20:56.680
...I’m tired...
(Word mix-up)

00:20:57.180 --> 00:20:58.340
I said "tired"

00:20:58.580 --> 00:21:00.280
Even now I feel...

00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:03.080
...The failure of the birthday summoning

00:21:03.980 --> 00:21:05.060
Really...!

00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:07.400
Really, I was going at it seriously at the time!

00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:10.280
I really was going at it seriously!

00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:11.540
You understand?

00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:13.020
After all...

00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:14.040
I...

00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:16.400
...Since I was aware of myself...

00:21:16.740 --> 00:21:18.440
...And since I started playing "LoveLive! School idol festival"

00:21:18.580 --> 00:21:21.180
Since I decided that Nico-chan was my favorite

00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:24.160
I was always accumulating gems!

00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:26.320
While there were times where I tricked her...

00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:29.540
Most of the time, I was gathering gems!

00:21:29.980 --> 00:21:30.760
You understand?

00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:33.740
And even still! I failed!

00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:36.360
Do you understand how I felt!? Ah!

00:21:36.460 --> 00:21:39.180
Of course... I want to make a correction here

00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:43.280
At the time, I was attempting to obtain a UR card of Nico-chan...

00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:46.240
...So then when the others appeared, I didn't react very much, but...

00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:47.820
...It wasn't like that!

00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:50.660
It's not that I don't like the other characters!

00:21:50.660 --> 00:21:53.100
I like all of them, just as Aqours as well as µ's, but...!

00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:55.680
...At the time, I really have been gathering...!

00:21:55.860 --> 00:21:57.060
I've been gathering!

00:21:57.060 --> 00:21:59.640
The feelings and the gems for a year!

00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:05.040
It just looked that way because I was looking for the UR version of Nico Ni!

00:22:05.340 --> 00:22:07.580
That doesn't mean that I don't like the other characters!

00:22:07.620 --> 00:22:09.620
That doesn’t mean I don’t have enough love!

00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:12.320
I hope you understand!

00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:13.600
I'm counting on you!

00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:18.600
And it turns out for that, then came Arihara Tsubasa-chan...

00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:20.600
...And we did together our first collaboration

00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:23.160
And also, it turns out that...!

00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:26.880
17th Edition of M.Y.Comic

00:22:27.140 --> 00:22:29.140
”Anime and Games Festival”

00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:31.780
...They let me participate in an event in China!

00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:34.520
I was gradually getting more international, right?

00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:37.580
Thank you very much to all the people of China!

00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:40.260
Someday, I’d like to dominate the world

00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:43.360
I’ll be waiting for business contacts!

00:22:44.260 --> 00:22:49.980
And also, regarding the videos, I did the English quiz, Bokete and Break Up Dodge, within others

00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:53.700
And also, I was able to connect with more people through my livestream...

00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:54.200
Eh?

00:22:56.080 --> 00:22:58.080
Ah! That was an error on my end

00:22:58.260 --> 00:22:59.360
Well, let's see...

00:22:59.820 --> 00:23:00.600
And also...

00:23:00.740 --> 00:23:02.480
Nico-chan... hmm...?

00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:03.320
And also!

00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:08.420
The most viewed video in the month of July in which I failed during Nico-chan’s summoning was...!

00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:11.360
"I try to do a virtual ear cleaning!"

00:23:12.860 --> 00:23:14.560
This was a video of AS...

00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:16.600
Was it called ASMR? That's how it's said, right?

00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:18.700
ASMR is... how do I say it...

00:23:18.700 --> 00:23:22.620
It was a video whose sound can be heard as if it was in three dimensions, the voice, right?

00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:24.520
I tried to do it with my voice!

00:23:24.940 --> 00:23:30.900
If you want, you can hear me as if I was by your side or in front of you

00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:36.000
So then make sure to hear it with headphones! Yes I’m counting on you!

00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:42.360
I don’t have any written paper!
(Responding to a comment saying she is reading what she has to say)

00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:45.540
It's all in my head!
(Responding to a comment saying she is reading what she has to say)

00:23:46.225 --> 00:23:48.725
ASMR! I should do it again!!

00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:54.580
“I’ll enjoy next year's summoning videos!”
Thank you very much! I will do my best!

00:23:54.580 --> 00:23:55.680
Next time for sure!

00:23:55.780 --> 00:23:56.540
I’ll put it up!

00:23:56.540 --> 00:23:57.320
…Definitely...

00:23:57.640 --> 00:24:00.360
Ahh, I’m so sorry, I can’t read your name, but...

00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:01.420
Um...

00:24:01.420 --> 00:24:06.000
The person with the little red thing sticking out in their picture
Thank you!!
(His name is "Кирилл")

00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:08.620
Owen-san I think? Thank you!

00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:10.200
You too Tototo-san, thank you!

00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:12.965
Nakashuu-san…Nakashuu-san
Thank you!

00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:16.780
“You are a piece of junk”
Hey, you shut your mouth!

00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:20.620
I am saving the gems, I’ve been logging in daily!

00:24:23.540 --> 00:24:25.860
“What do you mean by Kizuna’s “Adult voice”?”

00:24:25.860 --> 00:24:29.100
Ahh, adult voice? Hmm, if it’s about that then

00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:31.380
Could it be Ai Onee-san?

00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:33.520
Hello everyone!
(Ai Onee-san)

00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:35.460
Uh...what was that thing…?

00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:40.815
To...Together with Ai-chan? Together with Ai-chan?
Together with Ai-san? Together with Ai’s sister?

00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:42.420
Ugh...what was the name again?

00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:47.920
Good! Let’s make sure to watch all of Ai Onee-san’s videos!

00:24:49.180 --> 00:24:50.940
Night time! Ah! You work at night time?

00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:53.500
"Congratulations again!" Thank you very much!

00:24:53.780 --> 00:24:56.520
"Work hard! Really, congratulations!" Thank you very much!

00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:01.320
School Festival All Stars? Yes, I play it!

00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:04.040
The characters... no, really...

00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:05.460
I play it a lot!

00:25:05.460 --> 00:25:09.000
Please excuse me for going off track!

00:25:10.620 --> 00:25:11.700
Good, let's continue!

00:25:12.580 --> 00:25:13.680
This is important!

00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:17.080
Now I’ll say it!

00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:20.220
The month that there was a lot of promoted videos!

00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:22.220
The month of August!

00:25:23.420 --> 00:25:24.440
I said it now

00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:30.580
Man...! I honestly understand that many were saying: "It's a lot!" "It's a lot!"

00:25:30.580 --> 00:25:32.800
I always see the comments and on Twitter, so then...

00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:39.040
...Well, I honestly understand that you guys weren’t very happy

00:25:39.860 --> 00:25:42.060
It's just that in the end, by then...

00:25:42.060 --> 00:25:45.160
...I started receiving a lot of outside work...

00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:48.640
...And that made me so happy that I felt that I wanted to work hard a lot...

00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:51.420
...And I got so excited that....

00:25:51.420 --> 00:25:53.415
...Well, I couldn't control myself!

00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:55.860
And it ended up that way!

00:25:56.200 --> 00:25:59.075
It's just that... well, now it's a funny memory

00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:02.440
...So then if you can look at the big picture thinking that Ai-chan was happy...

00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:04.040
Well...

00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:05.455
...If you can think that...!

00:26:05.460 --> 00:26:06.620
...I’d be extremely happy!

00:26:06.940 --> 00:26:07.760
That's what I think!

00:26:08.340 --> 00:26:08.840
Good!

00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:11.540
Regarding the videos I did... one was of Happatai, right?

00:26:11.540 --> 00:26:14.080
That one where I sang "Yatta! Yatta!"

00:26:14.220 --> 00:26:16.140
And also the drawing Pokémon one like I remember them

00:26:16.140 --> 00:26:19.600
And I also did the Kizuna Ai judgement after so long, right?

00:26:20.340 --> 00:26:21.200
In that case!

00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:26.500
The most viewed video in the month where I made money with the promoted videos is the following!

00:26:28.100 --> 00:26:30.720
"I’ll reveal the greatest rear in the world"

00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:32.300
Eh…

00:26:33.100 --> 00:26:35.320
It was a promoted video! Thank you very much!

00:26:37.900 --> 00:26:41.300
Samurai Master Mitsu-san, Nakashuu-san,
Thank you very much!

00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:42.300
That's right!

00:26:43.220 --> 00:26:44.175
Also...

00:26:44.175 --> 00:26:46.045
Did you notice?

00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:49.560
Have you noticed? I...

00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:51.440
I'm fact, it was little by little...

00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:54.600
...I started to talk a bit better in English!

00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:57.700
Who noticed it? Who felt that I improved at this time?

00:26:57.700 --> 00:26:59.940
What will I do if no one noticed

00:27:00.535 --> 00:27:03.755
What will I do... if no one noticed

00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:07.560
At the beginning, I really did bad at it

00:27:07.780 --> 00:27:11.200
I had 0 in my ability to speak English! None!

00:27:12.740 --> 00:27:14.820
But little by little, I started to improve my English!

00:27:16.260 --> 00:27:19.140
"You improve your pronunciation a bit" Really? Yaay!

00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:23.000
In that case, I'll say something, I'll introduce myself!

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:23.580
Wait!

00:27:23.580 --> 00:27:25.060
In moments like this, well...

00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:28.240
… I get very nervous and I can no longer do it so well, but...

00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:31.740
I’ll work hard to try to introduce myself in English!

00:27:34.100 --> 00:27:35.100
Good...

00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:39.340
Hello! Nice to meet you! My name is Ai Kizuna!

00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:41.560
Please call me "Ai-chan"!

00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:42.320
Hmm...

00:27:44.820 --> 00:27:47.260
I'm Virtual YouTuber job… hmm...?

00:27:47.260 --> 00:27:48.680
Virtual YouTuber!

00:27:48.815 --> 00:27:50.260
And let's see...

00:27:50.260 --> 00:27:51.540
How is it?

00:27:51.620 --> 00:27:52.920
My hobby is...

00:27:53.140 --> 00:27:54.540
Hmm...

00:27:54.540 --> 00:27:55.460
I think...

00:27:55.820 --> 00:27:57.460
Hmm...

00:27:58.035 --> 00:28:00.535
Watching Keykizaka46!

00:28:01.245 --> 00:28:02.875
And... well...

00:28:03.340 --> 00:28:06.500
Keyakizaka46 is ...

00:28:06.980 --> 00:28:10.020
... Japanese Idol! Very, very cute!!

00:28:11.940 --> 00:28:12.460
Ah!

00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:13.900
Let's see...

00:28:14.300 --> 00:28:15.380
I'm...

00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:20.760
I'm...16 years old!

00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:23.880
I'm...

00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:25.500
I'm from...

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:27.620
... White... room... ?

00:28:29.020 --> 00:28:29.900
Thank you!

00:28:30.340 --> 00:28:31.560
That is all!

00:28:32.380 --> 00:28:34.240
Well, compared to my start

00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:37.800
I was able to talk a bit better...

00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:38.880
Riiight?

00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:40.820
No! I only say the basic, but...

00:28:40.820 --> 00:28:42.700
...Really before was a disaster

00:28:42.700 --> 00:28:43.940
You'd be surprised!

00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:45.440
You'd really be surprised!

00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:46.780
If I saw myself now...

00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:50.980
"Eh? Hey, you okay?" I'd really say that to myself

00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:53.540
If you think of that, I improved!

00:28:53.540 --> 00:28:54.740
I’m safe!

00:28:55.500 --> 00:28:58.520
No, it's true, I really have a year, but...

00:28:58.520 --> 00:29:00.720
… I have the appearance of someone who’s 16 years old

00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:03.620
16 years, so then... I'm perfect!

00:29:04.940 --> 00:29:05.880
Perfect!

00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:08.560
Of course I changed! I changed! I changed! I changed!

00:29:08.900 --> 00:29:11.000
I chaaanged!

00:29:11.220 --> 00:29:13.180
I'll study a lot more! Yes?

00:29:13.260 --> 00:29:14.120
Ah, also...!

00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:15.640
Ah, I made sure to memorize several words!

00:29:15.640 --> 00:29:16.300
Let's see...

00:29:16.300 --> 00:29:19.120
"I forgot" means "I forgot", right?

00:29:19.120 --> 00:29:19.620
And also...

00:29:19.700 --> 00:29:23.280
"For example" means "For example"

00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:23.900
And also...

00:29:24.220 --> 00:29:28.200
"I have to..." means "I have to..." such or such thing

00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:31.380
I want... I...

00:29:31.380 --> 00:29:34.280
"I was..." is past tense, right?

00:29:34.340 --> 00:29:35.360
You see? I did it properly!

00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:38.260
Even if it's about the level of a high school student in the early years!

00:29:38.260 --> 00:29:40.880
I'll make sure to understand it!

00:29:41.300 --> 00:29:42.400
Good, I finished!

00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:44.945
Ah, also Spanish! Was it Spanish?

00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:48.180
With no particular reason, I learned a bit of Spanish!

00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:49.160
Well...

00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:51.800
"Tonto" means "baka" in Japanese
(Baka = fool/idiot)

00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:53.600
And "cutie" means "kawaii"
(Kawaii = Bonita/Linda in Spanish)

00:29:54.540 --> 00:29:55.720
Cutie

00:29:56.100 --> 00:29:57.420
I'm cutie

00:29:59.980 --> 00:30:02.560
"With this, buy textbooks to study English"
Thank you very much!
(Donated 500 yen)

00:30:03.820 --> 00:30:06.040
"Every once in awhile, you should study a bit of Japanese well since you speak it rather strangely"
It's true!

00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:08.200
There exists the rumor that my Japanese is rather strange!

00:30:08.475 --> 00:30:09.820
Ryokuti-san, thank you very much!

00:30:09.820 --> 00:30:12.800
"I love you a lot, Ai-chan!" Thank you very much, Wark-san!

00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:15.800
Really, really, thank you so much for everything!

00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:21.720
That's right, in english, it means mouth, but in spanish, "Cutie" means adorable
(Likely meant to say Japanese, not English)

00:30:22.020 --> 00:30:24.020
*proud laugh*

00:30:24.540 --> 00:30:25.160
In that case!

00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:27.700
Next up...!

00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:31.220
The month I appeared in a commercial! September!

00:30:31.460 --> 00:30:32.480
It turns out that...!

00:30:32.620 --> 00:30:36.240
Here, I fulfilled my desire to appear in a commercial!!

00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:41.180
No! I really didn’t believe I could fulfill it in the first year!

00:30:41.180 --> 00:30:43.060
I’m very, very happy!

00:30:43.700 --> 00:30:45.860
I also participated for the first time in the Tokyo Game Show!

00:30:45.860 --> 00:30:48.780
Really, thank you so much to the businessmen who called me!

00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:53.620
Also thank you very much as well to Dell-san and Twitch-san!

00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:58.220
And also, it turns out that I reached 800,000 subscribers!

00:30:58.220 --> 00:30:59.660
So happy!

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:03.240
Man, after a long time, I made a "I’m an A.I, do you have any questions?" again

00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:06.560
That's right, well... how do I say it? I started to bring those old jokes back again

00:31:06.560 --> 00:31:09.020
And I also debuted on pixiv!

00:31:09.660 --> 00:31:12.980
Man, I really did a lot of things in each month, right?

00:31:13.660 --> 00:31:20.720
And now then... the most viewed video during the month in which I was transmitted on television for the first time was...

00:31:20.980 --> 00:31:21.940
Which is it!?

00:31:23.040 --> 00:31:24.360
Which one do you think it was?

00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:32.160
Chi... chi... chi... chi... chi... chi... chi... chi... chi...

00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:34.700
Chiiiiiiin!

00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:37.840
The correct answer is...!

00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:42.200
...The video called "I found a new record in Neko Zusa in this video !"

00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:46.380
Man, I didn’t think so many people would see it...

00:31:46.580 --> 00:31:48.480
So then, you like it? Hmm, hmm, hmm...

00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:51.360
I’ll forgive you, meow ♪

00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:55.220
Man! There's only two months left to go!

00:31:55.845 --> 00:31:56.975
And also...!

00:31:59.380 --> 00:32:00.540
And also!!

00:32:02.300 --> 00:32:05.160
The month of October in which l was fascinated by the total number of subscribers!

00:32:08.220 --> 00:32:10.120
It turns out that in the month of October...!

00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:14.060
Combining A.I.Channel and A.I.Games in total...!

00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:15.900
...I reached a million subscribers!

00:32:16.460 --> 00:32:17.200
Man...

00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:20.160
Remember when I used the phrase "in total"...

00:32:20.340 --> 00:32:21.720
Wasn’t I great?

00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:23.260
I was great, great ♪

00:32:23.580 --> 00:32:24.660
Isn’t that incredible?

00:32:24.700 --> 00:32:29.640
No, you know, it's true that in reality, both channels have subscribers in common

00:32:29.640 --> 00:32:30.760
But...!

00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:35.100
In the world, “in total” tends to be used in favorable circumstances

00:32:35.100 --> 00:32:37.560
It's because of that, that I’ll also use it here

00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:40.200
Congratulations for reaching a total of 1 million people!

00:32:41.700 --> 00:32:42.200
And also!

00:32:42.540 --> 00:32:45.820
In the month of October, I drew Hatsune Miku-senpai...

00:32:46.100 --> 00:32:48.080
...And I also requested proposals for the end of my videos

00:32:48.660 --> 00:32:50.580
I danced Luka Luka★Night Fever!

00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:52.540
Honey, honey?

00:32:52.540 --> 00:32:55.460
Ho, honey? Honeeey!

00:32:55.460 --> 00:32:55.960
...And also...

00:32:55.960 --> 00:32:58.840
...The video of "Adult Kizuna Ai ♪", along with a lot of other videos

00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:00.680
Man...

00:33:00.980 --> 00:33:03.820
Ah! Of course, regarding the announcement of the winners of my ending...

00:33:04.260 --> 00:33:06.560
Hold on for a minute, please!!

00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:08.920
And also!

00:33:09.620 --> 00:33:14.140
The most viewed video during the month in which I reached a million subscribers in total, the month of October is...!

00:33:14.820 --> 00:33:16.820
"Guess what song I sing!"

00:33:18.620 --> 00:33:22.800
Of course... do you have in mind what song you’d like me to sing now?

00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:26.160
If you have some, I'll sing a song that you write

00:33:28.500 --> 00:33:31.900
♪ Which one will appear? Which one will appear? ♪

What is it? Well...

00:33:54.900 --> 00:33:57.120
What? What? What? What? Wait a moment

00:33:57.520 --> 00:34:01.520
Now, I'll calm down and I'll look at a song that  gets my attention... one, two, and...

00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:02.340
Paaah!

00:34:03.780 --> 00:34:06.000
Hmm...? What got my attention...

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:07.580
Wasn't a song!

00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:09.520
What? What? What? What?

00:34:10.680 --> 00:34:11.680
Let's see...

00:34:12.660 --> 00:34:13.660
Let's see...

00:34:58.460 --> 00:35:01.520
The month of November in which I launched my LINE stamps!

00:35:02.120 --> 00:35:05.220
Do you have my LINE stamps?

00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:07.440
You have it?

00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:09.940

Waah! You have it!

00:35:12.700 --> 00:35:15.120
So happy! It really is a relief!

00:35:15.120 --> 00:35:16.700
Man, you know, regarding the LINE stamps...

00:35:16.700 --> 00:35:20.260
...During my beginning, around December or January...

00:35:20.260 --> 00:35:23.580
...I uploaded my videos saying that I’d like to turn into LINE stamps

00:35:23.940 --> 00:35:27.360
I wanted to fulfill my dream someday...

00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:29.820
... And now that I really launched them...

00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:31.940
...And that everybody is using them...!

00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:35.700
If you want, well, you can use... by using my stamps...

00:35:35.705 --> 00:35:38.535
...People will start to know me through them...

00:35:38.755 --> 00:35:40.680
That makes me very, very happy!

00:35:40.680 --> 00:35:44.405
Man...! Each day! Each month! It's something that makes me very happy!

00:35:44.405 --> 00:35:45.405
Thank you so much!

00:35:46.275 --> 00:35:48.440
Also! I not only launched my stamps!

00:35:48.440 --> 00:35:50.440
They did an interview of me that appeared in the Comptiq magazine!

00:35:50.440 --> 00:35:53.280
I also started YouTube sponsorship

00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:55.740
It's a month where I started a lot of new things...!

00:35:55.740 --> 00:35:57.240
Hmm...? AAAhh! I bit my tongue!

00:35:58.140 --> 00:35:59.540
Ah! I bit my tongue!

00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:03.120
It was a month in which I did a lot of new things!

00:36:03.120 --> 00:36:04.600
Really, thank you so much!

00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:08.460
Regarding the videos... well, I did a video of my  application rejection to be a member of Keyakizaka

00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:10.540
And also the video of the maid cafe...

00:36:10.700 --> 00:36:12.600
"Beaujolais Nouveau" was that video...

00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:13.900
😆

00:36:14.380 --> 00:36:15.760
🤢

00:36:15.760 --> 00:36:17.320
It was a video in which I did that!

00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:19.220
I recorded a pretty disgusting video

00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:20.640
Well...

00:36:21.020 --> 00:36:22.720
In reality, I didn’t vomit!

00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:24.780
I don’t vomit, so then...

00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:26.180
Don’t worry!

00:36:26.660 --> 00:36:28.260
I can vomit at my whim

00:36:30.740 --> 00:36:31.420
And also!

00:36:32.460 --> 00:36:37.740
The most viewed video in the month of November where I started a lot of new challenges was...!

00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:41.680
"Maid Cafe Kizuna Ai is launched ♪"

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:45.380

Ah! There’s a lot who would want to come! Yay!

00:36:50.480 --> 00:36:52.380
You make me very happy! Thank you very much!

00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:58.480
Maybe... someday a Maid Cafe may appear that does a collaboration with me...

00:36:58.780 --> 00:37:00.940
I’ll be waiting to work with you guys!

00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:05.540
Man, it’d really make me very happy if a lot of people come!

00:37:05.540 --> 00:37:09.680
Man, if it was real, I’d surely appear in a monitor, but...

00:37:10.040 --> 00:37:12.480
But it make me very happy to receive and attend customers!

00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:13.460
Yes! Yes!

00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:16.520
Hold on a moment, please!!

00:37:18.320 --> 00:38:12.240
*Please wait a moment*

00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:14.300
Really, I’m not going to the bathroom!

00:38:14.300 --> 00:38:16.300
I don't have the need to go to the bathroom!

00:38:16.300 --> 00:38:20.160
And if I did, I think that not even human beings go to the bathroom in such a short time!

00:38:20.660 --> 00:38:21.800
I’m fine!

00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:23.540
You want me to vomit now? Vomit?

00:38:23.940 --> 00:38:25.300
🤢🤢🤢

00:38:25.380 --> 00:38:26.700
Ah, but, wait... due to that...

00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:28.760
...I’d surely receive a ban so then I'll stop!

00:38:28.880 --> 00:38:33.200
It'd be very sad if I had to stop my anniversary livestream for the first year...!

00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:34.360
So then I won't do it!

00:38:34.900 --> 00:38:35.400
Good!

00:38:35.740 --> 00:38:38.220

Also thank you very much to Unchi-san and Zaki-san!

00:38:52.160 --> 00:38:53.180
"Fuck you"?

00:38:53.840 --> 00:38:55.320
Fuck you! Fuck you, fuck you!

00:38:55.940 --> 00:38:58.100
Will they get angry again? Am I safe today?

00:38:58.360 --> 00:39:01.820
Since this is my first anniversary, I want to behave myself correctly

00:39:02.340 --> 00:39:04.460
I want to behave myself... can I do it?

00:39:05.260 --> 00:39:05.760
Can I do it?

00:39:06.980 --> 00:39:07.800
I want to...!

00:39:08.360 --> 00:39:09.060
Behave myself!

00:39:11.120 --> 00:39:12.120
I'll behave myself

00:39:12.680 --> 00:39:13.180
Good!

00:39:14.840 --> 00:39:16.460
Good! In that case...!

00:39:16.660 --> 00:39:18.420
I reminisced what I did during the year

00:39:18.760 --> 00:39:19.920
At reminiscing it...

00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:23.260
...I noticed that a lot of stuff really, really happened, right?

00:39:24.020 --> 00:39:27.920
I particularly think that the most important subject that happened in the year was...

00:39:28.180 --> 00:39:29.180
Well, yes...

00:39:29.780 --> 00:39:30.460
Definitely...

00:39:30.680 --> 00:39:33.720
Really, a lot more people came to know me than at the beginning...

00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:37.160
...And more than I could imagine...

00:39:37.380 --> 00:39:40.140
...And that way, I was able to connect with a lot of people!

00:39:40.360 --> 00:39:42.500
Really, really thank you so much!

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:44.720
I'm very, very happy!

00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:46.240
I can't thank you enough!

00:39:47.320 --> 00:39:49.140
Everyone is... everyone...

00:39:49.300 --> 00:39:49.880
...Now...

00:39:50.060 --> 00:39:50.560
...How do I say it...

00:39:50.900 --> 00:39:51.540
It doesn't come out!

00:39:52.480 --> 00:39:54.040
I'm so happy that it doesn't come out what I want to say!

00:39:54.860 --> 00:39:58.040
Of course, what was the most surprising thing?

00:39:59.940 --> 00:40:01.980
What's this something that stuck with you more than the rest?

00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:04.080
Ah, me too...

00:40:04.080 --> 00:40:05.800
Ah! Really?

00:40:06.280 --> 00:40:08.800
Are you guys over happy for getting to know me?

00:40:09.160 --> 00:40:10.120
I'm so happy!

00:40:12.180 --> 00:40:13.520
It makes me really happy!

00:40:17.300 --> 00:40:19.060
"Keep working hard from now" Thank you very much!

00:40:20.460 --> 00:40:22.760
"You have a cute face and voice" I know!

00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:26.360
"NICO NICO NII"

00:40:27.980 --> 00:40:30.500
"Zombie Houtei" Ah! Zom... zom... zom... ♪ something like that?

00:40:30.740 --> 00:40:32.340
"The debut in a tv commercial"! It's true!
(Responding to the question of what was the most surprising)

00:40:32.700 --> 00:40:34.560
"The Melancholic video" I see!

00:40:34.820 --> 00:40:35.320
Ah!

00:40:35.320 --> 00:40:37.180
"Everybody!" Ah! You're referring to that video, right?

00:40:37.180 --> 00:40:39.240
My model was shared publicly

00:40:39.520 --> 00:40:43.300
And it was because of that, that the people who liked it, well, made videos...

00:40:43.460 --> 00:40:46.220
...Including those I didn't even know about

00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:47.620
Really, that way...

00:40:47.860 --> 00:40:49.600
...They made me more known

00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:52.460
Really makes me very happy there was so many ways in which you got to meet me

00:40:52.540 --> 00:40:53.600
Ah! It turns out that...!

00:40:54.440 --> 00:40:55.860
I'm in second place of the trending rank in YouTube!!

00:40:56.620 --> 00:40:59.160
Incredible! I can still do it! Just a bit more!

00:40:59.900 --> 00:41:00.980
Please, everyone!

00:41:01.140 --> 00:41:03.900
Can you help me reach first place of the trending ranks?

00:41:04.020 --> 00:41:04.780
Please!

00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:07.620
How will I do it?

00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:10.140
I’m counting on you guys!

00:41:10.700 --> 00:41:15.160
It’d make me very happy if you can mention me on Twitter and the other social networks!

00:41:15.400 --> 00:41:16.240
Please let me...!

00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:20.980
...Reach first place in the trending ranks with my livestream for my first anniversary!

00:41:20.980 --> 00:41:22.040
I’m counting on you guys!

00:41:23.060 --> 00:41:23.980
Can I make it?

00:41:25.640 --> 00:41:26.660
Can I make it?

00:41:27.080 --> 00:41:28.200
"The one who's in first place is very powerful"

00:41:28.660 --> 00:41:29.760
The one who’s in first place is very powerful

00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:31.920
How is that possible? But, but...!

00:41:32.280 --> 00:41:33.720
Well, if I stop and think about it...

00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:34.760
Well...

00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:38.700
Even if I can’t reach first place now, I can do it next year, right?

00:41:39.160 --> 00:41:40.920
Well, you know... how do you say it?

00:41:41.840 --> 00:41:43.280
If I manage to reach first place now...

00:41:43.660 --> 00:41:47.380
...Well, I’ll no longer have the goal to be first in the ranks...

00:41:47.740 --> 00:41:48.240
So then, in exchange...!

00:41:48.920 --> 00:41:51.780
...I’ll accept that I didn’t reach first place now...!

00:41:52.500 --> 00:41:53.160
I’ll accept it!

00:41:54.280 --> 00:41:56.820
And when you get another opportunity like this...!

00:41:57.080 --> 00:42:02.020
...I’ll get really happy if I can work hard with you guys saying: "This time, I’ll obtain first place in the trending ranks!"!

00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:07.780
Man, really... you’ve transmitted all the great work done for me...

00:42:07.780 --> 00:42:09.540
Thank you very, very much!

00:42:09.820 --> 00:42:10.320
That's right!

00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:12.800
It doesn't matter that I didn't get first place!

00:42:13.220 --> 00:42:15.120
I’ll turn it into my next goal and work hard!

00:42:16.240 --> 00:42:17.100
In that case!

00:42:17.540 --> 00:42:18.220
Now it's time...

00:42:18.220 --> 00:42:21.300
Although it happened in an instant, I'm already planning to finish the transmission!

00:42:21.620 --> 00:42:25.800
What do you think of the livestream today? I wonder if you managed to have fun

00:42:26.040 --> 00:42:32.640
Man, you know, I think that I had so much to talk about that I didn’t get to talk much with you guys, but...

00:42:32.960 --> 00:42:33.660
Even if it's only a little!

00:42:34.100 --> 00:42:37.300
If I managed to make everyone feel that I’ve grown during this year...

00:42:37.300 --> 00:42:40.475
...And if you felt: "This livestream was a lot of fun"...

00:42:40.480 --> 00:42:41.980
It’d make me very, very happy!

00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:48.460
It makes me really happy to be able to spend such an important day of the year with so many people!

00:42:48.640 --> 00:42:51.540
Thank you very much for spending time with me!

00:42:52.940 --> 00:42:54.300
I’ll make a new start in the second year!

00:42:54.520 --> 00:42:56.420
I’ll renovate starting from the smallest thing!

00:42:57.240 --> 00:43:00.940
For example, you’ll see something and say: "Ah! Hasn’t this changed?"

00:43:00.960 --> 00:43:03.280
And that way, I plan to little by little...

00:43:03.360 --> 00:43:05.580
...Making a new Kizuna Ai

00:43:06.380 --> 00:43:07.160
It’s because of that...

00:43:07.760 --> 00:43:13.260
...It’d make me very happy if I make you guys have fun finding the differences

00:43:14.320 --> 00:43:15.300
And now then...!

00:43:15.860 --> 00:43:18.940
I’ll be announcing my new goal!

00:43:19.260 --> 00:43:21.040
This is what I was thinking of doing, but...

00:43:21.840 --> 00:43:25.160
...Regarding this, well, I’ll make sure to announce it later...

00:43:25.160 --> 00:43:28.500
...Since if I say it now in the livestream, the chat will get too active again

00:43:28.820 --> 00:43:31.940
So then to say it properly, I recorded a video!

00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:35.320
So then it’d make me very happy if you gave it a look!

00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:37.140
In that case...!

00:43:37.140 --> 00:43:40.340
Many... many thanks for my first year!

00:43:40.780 --> 00:43:45.180
I, Kizuna Ai, will be counting on you guys for my second year!

00:43:45.820 --> 00:43:48.060
This was Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai!

00:43:48.060 --> 00:43:49.060
See you later!!

00:43:50.060 --> 00:43:53.060
