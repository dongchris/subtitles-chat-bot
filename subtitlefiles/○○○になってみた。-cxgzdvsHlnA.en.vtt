00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.620
Hi there, Virtual Youtuber Kizuna Ai here.

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:03.600
Everyone, before we go further,

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:06.420
You remember my suggestion box from last time?

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:07.580
Look at this!

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:08.740
What do you think?

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:10.300
It's glowing, right?

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:16.280
Today, we're going to use a random word from the box as the basis for a round quiz!

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.240
Up until now, we've used the random things for acting out scenes, but now,

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.940
I want you to guess what they are.

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:26.440
Well, my round quiz ability...

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:28.340
Well, you'll see soon enough, but

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:32.740
For people who don't know, maybe it's best you don't.

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.820
Round Quiz Ai-chan, start!

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:37.060
I'm picking the theme...

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:41.060
Ah, I see. This -

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.360
this is super normal.

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.060
Let's go.

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.140
Ah, what's this slimy liquid?

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:48.900
It's hot!

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:49.400
Hot!

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:50.160
HOT!

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:51.960
There's so much of it.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:52.860
No, no, no

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.060
Don't shake like that!

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:56.440
I'd like a bath.

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.440
Bathe until I'm nice and clean

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.360
Like my butt. It's always dirty...

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.460
Hey, wash me!

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.060
I'll go bad soon if you don't!

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:06.040
That's it.

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:07.600
Everyone, did you get it?

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.600
Ok, thinking time, start!

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:16.080
Round quiz, Round quiz, Round quiz, Round quiz! Round quiz!

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:18.820
Ok, time's up!

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:19.980
Did you get it?

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.200
The answer is...

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.440
A frypan!

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:25.740
Well?

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.320
I thought I properly conveyed the feelings of a frypan.

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.000
That was the round quiz!

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.260
Everyone! Do you properly wash the bottom of your frypan?

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:35.640
It gets burnt, after all.

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.580
That's why it's called a fry pan!

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.280
Ok, next!

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:42.260
Ah, I see.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:43.620
Ah, this too,

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:45.040
I think let's go,

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:45.880
So, let's go!

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:48.500
Full!

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:49.220
Full!!

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.960
So full!

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:52.280
So full!

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:53.420
No!

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:54.820
What flavour am I now?

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:55.980
No, no, no!

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:57.660
Anything but caramel!

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:59.620
Even just salt would be better!

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:01.600
Salt is fine! Put me over there!

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.160
Caramel!

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:04.100
That's it.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.440
Well, everyone? Did you understand?

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.640
So, thinking time, start!

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.620
Round quiz, round quiz, ro-und qu-iz, round quiz!
 
(Screen: Something you'd eat at a movie theatre)

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.840
Ok, time's up!

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:16.780
Did you understand?

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.800
With the hint this should be easy.

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.220
The answer is...

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.060
Popcorn!

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:24.780
Ok, this is the last one.

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.440
You'd better guess it.

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.960
Ah, you'll definitely get this one.

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.360
This is something you probably all have.

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:34.380
Let's go.

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.140
Start!

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.060
Please don't touch me with those dirty hands.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.160
Please, just like you should wash your hands before eating, wash your hands before you touch me,

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.680
Wash your hands!

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.840
You don't have to click so intensely!

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:49.300
It hurts!

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:50.820
Please don't drop me.

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:51.920
It hurts!!

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.360
It hurts. Ah!

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:54.360
My face!

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.360
My beautiful face!

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.040
That's all.

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.200
Did you get it?

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.220
Thinking time, start!

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.720
Hint: a high tech device nearby

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:12.580
Ok, time's up!

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:16.860
The answer is... something you probably have in your hand

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.120
A smartphone!

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.340
Well, everyone, did you get it?

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.460
For the people who didn't get it, or those without imagination,

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:26.580
think harder next time!

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.240
Perfect.

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:31.240
What did you think of my acting skills?

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:33.020
that's right, they're amazing.

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.280
These guessing games, if you guys like them, I'll do more in the future.

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.280
If you come up with a good theme, leave a comment!

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:43.800
This was Virtual Youtuber Kizuna Ai. See you later!

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.120
The box is great, isn't it...

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:48.280
I want to use it a little more.

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:50.980
Ah, it's like a hot spring!

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:51.860
It's like being in a bath.

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:53.860
♫ It's go-o-d~ ♫
