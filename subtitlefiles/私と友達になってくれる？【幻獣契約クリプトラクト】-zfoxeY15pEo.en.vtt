'When looking into the darkness, becareful'

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.180
'The Darkness is again, not something you can control'

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:45.280
Ai: it' not..

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.620
Aoi: you looking this way is problematic~

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:49.220
Ai: it's wrong~

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.140
Aoi: the wrong one, right~

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.820
Ai: is there a way we can make this Kiru chan maybe?

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:56.120
Aoi: you can't..

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:59.240
Aoi: but this Nadia character is really popular you know

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:00.840
Ai: ah popular?

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:02.180
Aoi: she's cute~

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:03.880
Ai: yeah she's cute as you say~

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:04.780
Ai: is she strong?

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:05.580
Aoi: she's strong~

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:07.520
Ai: from her and kiru chan, who's stronger?

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.020
Aoi: that depends on the people~

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:13.860
Ai: let's get this quest started~!

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.340
Ai: it's this right..

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:19.080
Ai: 1st Quest~

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.880
Ai: Let's Go!

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.040
Ah~ there's cute ones too~

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:27.660
Ai: a cute one would be cute right~

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.460
Ai: ahh this one!

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.120
Ai: now.. let's march!

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
'Exactly as was boasted, the infinity..'

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.520
'after strict training..'

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:39.040
Ai: oh there's narration at this point~

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.360
Aoi: isn't it good?

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:41.320
Ai: yeah~

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.780
Ai: Eh~ will it always be narrated..?

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:46.640
Aoi: well theres parts that have it and parts that don't

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.500
Woah! the attack power is, it's quite strong ~

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:56.740
Ai: since it's playing, i want to watch~

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.280
Ai: ah so cool~

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:02.500
aoi: oh~ she defeated it

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.800
Ai: it's definitely good to have a strong character from the start isn't it

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.520
Ai: it's started now~

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.380
Aoi: it's a good way to use it (the character)

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.160
Ai: i got the words too

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:30.300
Ai: oooh.. great isn't it~

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.320
Ai: ahh it's so cute!

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:36.660
*Squidgy Squidgy*

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:39.940
Ai: *Squidgy Squidgy*!

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:41.920
Aoi: *Squidgy Squidgy*~ but it's quite weak isn't it..

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Ai: oh.. just a bit left~

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:46.940
Ai: with this ..

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.180
Ai: nothing? is it going to happen..?

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:51.760
'the power of water'

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.520
Ai: Definitely talented, me i mean~

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:58.440
Ai: how did it go..?

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:59.760
Aoi: You cleared it~

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:00.960
Aoi: You cleared it~ 
Ai: i Cleared it!

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.060
Ai: if we  apply for it.. do you think it'd upset them?

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:10.520
Ai: application complete~!

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.100
Ai: the excitement dropped a bit before..

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:16.280
Ai: but now it's back ~!.. but we didn't give the character a real name right..?

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:17.900
Ai: the starting gacha is definitely important isn't it..

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.060
Ai: well.. can give it one after using either way~

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Aoi: where.. what points were the most fun?

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:28.240
Ai: it has to be the.. motions~

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:30.780
Ai: the pretty/clean motions and also..

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.440
Ai: specifically, i found nothing really~

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:38.180
Ai: honestly, i was just dabbling but then this grate, what'd you call it..

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:42.300
Ai: also, even though it sounded really easy..

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:45.360
Ai: in reality, in a difficult battle

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:47.440
the level of difficulty for the strategy etc

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.640
and how you had to think about it too was really fun~

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:51.380
Aoi: as expected of ai chan

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.600
Aoi: the strategy is important! from here on, if it builds...

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:56.300
Aoi: it's gradually become even more fun in the end

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:57.640
Ai: lets try it a bit..

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:00.640
Ai: you know the Squidgy one, can it be useful?

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:02.920
Aoi: hmm.. that one..

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:07.280
Aoi: most likely, from the next one you'll be able to use it more..

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:13.740
Aoi: you need to train and increase it..

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:14.440
Ai: ah really,

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.500
Ai: so then if we train it from the start it'll become AI right~

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:19.480
Ai: ah, you introduced me to such a great game!

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:20.460
Ai: i'm going to keep going..

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:22.280
Ai: to develop/train that 'Slime' character~

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:23.060
Aoi: good luck with that~

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:25.660
Ai: by the way, you mentioned earlier but,..

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:27.860
Ai: you can become 'friends' on here right?

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:29.660
Ai: so even i can make friends~!

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:31.620
Ai: only in the game though~
Aoi: yeah you can

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:33.640
Ai: so with that

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.960
Ai: i'm thinking of playing this game quite a bit

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:40.260
Ai: so i want to recruit some friends who will fight with me ~!

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:42.780
Ai: from this 'Friend' button..

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:45.880
Ai: click here and your own ID will show...

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.240
Ai: so here is my ID~!

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:52.540
Ai: did you memorise? well it's a video so you can go back and pause~...

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:56.660
Ai: so with that you can and should definitely send me a friend request!

00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:58.640
Aoi: do you think they'll come?

00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:59.660
Ai: they wont come you mean?

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:02.020
Aoi: since you don't have friends they wont come..

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:04.240
Aoi: but you never know..

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:05.940
Ai: they'll come... (anxious)

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:09.740
Aoi: well, go ahead an.. tell them to come~

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
Aoi: having strong friends will make it easier to do, when it comes to battles,...

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:15.540
Aoi: so to the fans.. to the audience,...

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:17.780
Aoi: you should invite them to get stronger together with you

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:19.140
Ai: ah you're right..

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:20.840
Ai: you all should become strong for me. 
(Relying on you)

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:24.620
Ai: so please send me a friend request okay..

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:26.940
Ai: if i end up with zero then i can't do anything...

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:30.240
Ai: let's become friends!

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:31.640
