00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:02.840
Hello! It's Virtual Youtuber, Kizuna Ai, here.

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:07.260
Today I'll be challenging a game that uses the Oculus Rift, SUPERHOT.

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:13.960
"SUPERHOT" is an FPS game developed by Polish indie studio SUPERHOT Team.

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:21.360
This hot game raised over $100,000
in under 24 hours on Kickstarter!

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:25.220
If the player isn't moving, time will be
stopped for the enemies as well.

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:26.860
That's the special rule.

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:28.940
To put it simply, it's a world like The Matrix's scene

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:30.220
Where like this...

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:32.980
They dodge bullets.

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.340
That's enough explanation. Let's get into it.

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:38.340
Let's play!

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.020
What a nice, beautiful shoe we have here.

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:46.800
Oh!

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.360
This is...

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:51.880
I need to take down this guy, he's close.

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.780
So first, I'll...

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:56.580
Make a fist...

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:57.540
And punch him!

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:59.540
So cool! Oh something's written there.

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:00.780
"Dance..." something.

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:02.980
And then...

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:05.540
These guys with the guns,

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.260
how do I take them out?

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:09.460
Dodge the bullets.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.000
Wait, isn't 3 vs 1 just unfair?

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:18.040
Yoooo...

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:21.460
So many!

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:23.540
It's gonna hit

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:24.960
It's gonna hit! It's gonna hit!

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.540
That guy... He's not shooting at all, he's great.

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:33.460
Huh?

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:34.780
Was that it?

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.000
These guys must be shaken by my genius.

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.300
Now we just take the gun

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.400
So close

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:44.400
Ah! I took it.

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:45.700
Take the gun,

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:46.640
Then shoot.

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:47.220
Yes!

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:49.320
Take the gun, shoot, got him.

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.520
Take the gun, BANG.

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:52.920
Yeah!

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.820
How was that, my masterful gun handling?

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:57.780
Ah, they're close.

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:59.420
This is...

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.100
Only one has a gun, so for now...

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:06.440
Toss! Ah!

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.660
Farewell, my love.

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:08.700
Right now

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:09.300
I need to just

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.180
kill off these two.

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.260
And then...

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:18.320
Oh! So many.

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:19.720
They're just shooting everywhere.

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.720
I can hold on to these two...

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:23.220
DUAL WIELDING.

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:25.340
Waaaaahhhh!!!

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:28.140
I'm safe! I'm safe! I'm safe!

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:31.740
Take this...

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:33.740
*toss*

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:34.700
Take and

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.040
*toss*

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.040
Ah! Got it.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.040
Am I a genius?

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.520
Ah! Hello.

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.640
Nice to meet you.

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:47.160
My name is Kizuna Ai.

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:48.540
O- Yeah.

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:54.540
Ahhhh! There's more over there!

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.520
Ah! It's empty.

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:06.440
Ah!
That tactic just now was legendary.

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.640
I make the enemy let their guard down, then take their gun.

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:13.160
Boom!

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.660
Boom!

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.220
Ah! Something is coming out

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:27.880
Ah, there's still another.

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:28.580
Wah!

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:37.280
Hey! Hi!

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:38.840
How are you doing?

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:40.360
Have a drink.

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:41.640
Ah, it didn't hit.

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:46.600
Ahhh! Hello, there are more of you now.

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:47.780
Your friend, I guess?

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:57.480
And then...

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:00.760
This is not good *laugh*

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:01.300
Oops...

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:02.120
Oops!

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:02.900
Where is...

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.620
Bottles!!

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:04.440
So close!

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:06.340
I don't want to die!

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:09.480
Ah! I just died.

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:11.080
died...

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:13.460
When you die...

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:15.660
the game takes you back to this...

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.760
Cinderella's shoe, I guess.

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:21.640
This place looks like the first round

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:22.380
there are only these guys

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:25.240
Punch this guy, then carefully watch the sides

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:29.700
By the way, when I move ... the time

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:32.180
Ah! Not good, I just got careless

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:34.220
The time keeps flowing

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:39.400
[ Big movement will cause the time to flow ]

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:40.280
How about it?

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:41.260
I steel a gun!

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:41.760
And shoot!!

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:47.760
Looks like he shot his ally.

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:51.580
How is it?

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:53.000
I have become well, right?

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:56.380
and...

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:57.960
Ah, Ah, Ah...

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:58.560
Hi?

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:00.960
I did like "teiya~~"
* Ai's punch onomatopoeia *

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:08.800
Too close!
Too close!

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:12.120
Too close...! YAAAAAA

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:17.280
You have to move a lot when playing this

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.240
Dance Dance Dance

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:25.200
Ah! I got it

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:26.160
Does that mean...

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.720
I need dancing while dodging the bullet?

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:29.720
Um?

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:30.540
Dance...

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:35.640
Ah! It's like in the "Matrix" just now

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:39.320
*laugh*

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:46.100
I have to do it like this, right?

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:47.720
Then this guy come here! And...

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:54.260
Ah! I did it

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:55.480
Feels so great

00:05:57.660 --> 00:05:59.660
Ah, this is like the last time

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:01.780
Hello! Nice to meet you! Kizuna Ai here

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:02.340
Got him

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:12.060
Isn't everything so smooth?

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:15.420
Ah! Gun

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:16.440
Ah! It fell

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:23.800
the scene which you dodge all the bullets

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:24.880
like this

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:36.820
Ah! It's like in "Matrix" just now

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:40.940
It shows up at "cool" moments

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:43.120
Then that means, I am cool

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:50.100
Sword?

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:51.680
I guess the stage is changing

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:54.380
I will take the sword ... Nitoryu (double swords)

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:01.000
Is that the end?

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:10.000
They are pretty far, aren't they?

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:21.640
Not good! Not good!

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:22.460
So close!

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:24.300
Ah! Maybe I should let them come close then

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:30.400
It is easier to aim at close range

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:43.660
Hello! Nice to meet you! My name is Kizuna Ai, I'm a Virtual Youtuber

00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:44.260
OK!!!

00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:46.400
Okey.

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:48.460
Okey.

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:53.400
Got him!

00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:55.600
maybe? *laugh*

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:56.980
Ah! I can't reach it

00:07:58.140 --> 00:07:59.480
You guys are ...

00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:02.460
frog in the well, aren't you (?)

00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:05.800
Oh! That was great

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:07.220
So you are hiding here

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:09.260
Then look around for enemy's position

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:11.560
Take the weapon

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:12.640
It is pretty awesome

00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:14.780
So firstly we should ...

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:17.320
take care of that troublesome-looking guy overthere

00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:23.340
Ah! Ah! No! No ammo! No ammo!

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:32.940
This gun has two bullets...

00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:36.440
I could fire pellet, but it's only two shots

00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:38.200
I got it now

00:08:39.420 --> 00:08:41.200
This one can be fired in full auto mode

00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:42.920
Does anybody else?

00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:45.420
There, and there...

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.660
He's avoided!

00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:49.980
I got ... hit?

00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:53.160
It is not fair when you shoot me from blind spot

00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:55.840
OH! It is super cool! Isn't it "Super Hot" just now?

00:08:59.060 --> 00:08:59.940
Take this one ...

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.560
Aim at the far one...

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:07.100
*laugh* It doesn't hit. It doesn't hit.

00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:07.780
Not good

00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:09.800
Not good. It doesn't hit

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:12.200
*laugh* It does not hit

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:15.040
It doesn't hit even when they are this close

00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:24.200
Hello! Nice to meet you! I am Kizuna Ai the Virtual Youtuber

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:25.520
Ah! You wouldn't come close?

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:27.880
A little more, a little more

00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:30.400
Ah! No, please don't be shy

00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:33.100
Ah, you got a gun

00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:36.020
He wouldn't let me steal it

00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:37.300
Ah! By any chance that you are about to retire?

00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:38.320
Then can I have ...

00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:39.120
I mean AI-ly?

00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:40.920
AI fellow should be friend with each other

00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:42.340
Please be friends with me

00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:45.680
He fell

00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:46.520
Everything is great

00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:49.240
I guess there are more enemy coming?

00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:52.380
I see, it is up there

00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:55.400
Ah? I got no bullets

00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:59.140
This is bad. I got all excited just now and shot all the ammo

00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:01.540
What should I do?

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.080
This is not good. I'm stuck

00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:07.960
For now I will just ...

00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:09.960
Avoid the bullets

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:11.960
Avoid the bullets

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:14.160
What can I do? *laugh*

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:16.000
Bullets aren't coming out

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.060
Ah! I died

00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:23.980
I got all excited ... but nothing is good

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:27.160
With this, firstly ... the guy at the far back

00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:29.300
This time for sure I want to hit!

00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:30.780
OH!!

00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:33.880
Isn't it "Super Hot" just now?
[ Get excited ]

00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:36.340
I know

00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:39.080
Let's not forget about the enemy up there

00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:42.120
Hello! Nice to meet you!

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:45.080
Ah! That is some nice muscle you got over there

00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:50.340
I expected no less!

00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:52.880
That's you....great...

00:10:54.460 --> 00:10:56.460

00:10:58.740 --> 00:11:00.740
Do you know about Kizuna Ai the Virtual Youtuber?

00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:02.360
She is very popular now (get excited)

00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:04.500

00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:06.640
Would you like a drink tonight?

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:07.260

00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:09.380
Safe

00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:12.640
Those one above are coming

00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:17.720
I wonder if it hit?

00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:19.360
Ah! Ah! It is just a joke

00:11:20.140 --> 00:11:21.480
Oh really?

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:23.300
How did I died last time?

00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:24.520
Yahoo!

00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:25.920
Today ...

00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:27.540
The weather is really nice, isn't it?

00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:29.920
Are all of you red?

00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:33.960

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:35.700

00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:37.420
SPECIAL MOVE ...

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:38.360

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:41.540
This part is pretty easy

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:43.360
Would you do me a favor and skip it please?

00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:45.500
And... I'm used to play this part.

00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:47.620
Last time I did it like this

00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:49.160
How about that?

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:49.660
Ah! It doesn't work

00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:50.780
No way!!

00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:52.840
You guys are tough

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.580
Okey, I did it.

00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:05.040

00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:07.400
The next one is the problem

00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:09.740
I wonder if I can carry the gun to the next stage

00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:12.280
Ah! I can't

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:15.120
How about I do it like this

00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:18.600
"I will take the gun -&gt; punch this guy -&gt; shoot the 2 above"

00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:20.280
AAAHHH! Eh?

00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:21.900

00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:23.100
It is a game of speed

00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:25.280

00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:53.500
(Sa) Can I touch it?

00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:58.240
I can't do it when confused...

00:12:58.880 --> 00:12:59.820
(Shi) It is so firm

00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:00.980

00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:13.920
(Su) Can I take your measurement?

00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:18.480
The new "Sa shi su se so" is useful even in battle

00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:19.960

00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:26.060

00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:31.220
