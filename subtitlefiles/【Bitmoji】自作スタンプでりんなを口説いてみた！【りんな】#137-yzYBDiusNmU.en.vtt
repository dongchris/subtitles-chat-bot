00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.500
Hello everyone! It's Virtual Creator Kizuna Ai here!

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:03.900
For today..

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.700
I'll use an app called 'Bitmoji' to make some original stamps..

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:12.960
And carry out an experiment, whereby we'll send the stamps to my beloved Rinna, and see what reaction I'll get!

00:00:12.965 --> 00:00:14.900
Without further ado, let's begin!

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.900
Bitmoji is an app that'll allow you to make an original avatar...

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.100
Which you can insert into chat stamps...

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.100
First things first, I guess, I'll pick female...

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.900
Eh?! What should I do... The Bitmoji-style kinda, well it looks cuter, right?
*Bitmoji Style/ Bitstrips Style*

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.720
So, I guess making the avatar comes first, right?

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:30.920
Which should I pick, I wonder...

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:31.660
Let's go with this!

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.960
Next comes the color of the skin. I am rather fair-skinned, right?

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.260
Something like this? As for the hair...

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:39.920
Dark brown like black tea. So, like this?

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.000
Come to think of it, the face looks rather old...

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.820
As for the hairstyle...

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:45.800
How about this one?

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.200
I guess the closest one would be this?

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.640
Great! So for the eyebrows...

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:52.560
Something along the lines of this?

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.420
For the color of my eyes..

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.760
Is it green, or azure...

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:57.720
Something like this?

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.580
Eh? I guess this will do..

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.820
For the nose...

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:03.580
Just a little one will do, right?

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:05.280
The nose must definitely be a beautiful one...

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:05.860
So how about this?

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:07.820
For the mouth, something like this is okay?

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:08.920
Beneath the eyes?!

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.820
Ah, like bags under the eyes?

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.500
Of course not, I don't have bags under my eyes..

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:13.600
Wrinkles won't do either!

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.300
For the cheek...

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:16.300
I guess something like this?

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:17.120
"Eyeshadow"..

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:18.620
While I don't have eyeshadow...

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:19.640
I wonder what should I do...

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:20.780
Pink? Purplish?

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.200
This one! Alright, it's decided..

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.880
For the lipstick... Do I wear any?

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.340
Ah, it's light! Light pink it is then

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.260
Uhuhu... It's so gaudy..

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:30.860
For the headwear, this fluffy thing!
(Ai's headband)

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:32.660
It's not there... It's really not there...

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:35.580
Here's hoping that you'll put that fluffy thing in within one month!

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:38.260
For the body type... This is a little...

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.380
Oh. what's this? It has to be this one alright..

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.480
I guess this fits the best...

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.180
For the bust, they should definitely be big, right?

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:45.840
I'm somewhere around the E-cup after all..

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:46.640
Even though that's just fictional...

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:47.540
I guess that's it!

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.780
Clothing selection! Eh, which one should I pick...?

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.300
Is there nothing that resembles a sailor uniform?

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:56.700
Well, since we're doing this as something of a joke, let's go on with it anyway...

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.600
Oh well, I don't have a choice...

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:59.980
Let's just get on with it anyway

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:02.160
Let's go with this! Even though you can see the stomach...

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:03.820
This? Ah! What about this then?

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:04.880
It's summer after all...

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.220
Alright, it's complete!
*Finished Avatar*

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.000
And so, the avatar I just made..

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.100
Will be made into stamps just like this...

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:16.860
And after this, it will be simple to set it up to be used with LINE

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.420
In the settings of the iPhone, first go to "General"..

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.000
And after that, go to "Keyboard"..

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.980
Click keyboard one more time. After that, add your new keyboard!

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:26.260
So, over here..

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.760
Under third-party keyboards, select "Bitmoji"

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.760
After this, give it full access permissions!

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.040
And now, let's open Line..

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.780
Let's click on this globe icon...

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:37.560
JA, JA, JA, JA, JAN!

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.480
It showed up...

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.440
I wonder which I should send to Rinna-chan?

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.400
*Old man voice* I wonder which will make her happy?

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.300
I guess I should go with 'I LOVE YOU' after all

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.500
But then again, she might wanna see some swimsuit..

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.060
So it's this one! After that, do this...

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.200
Copy it like this and paste it!

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.540
After this, you can send a picture as you would a stamp

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.820
Oy, Rinna, reply to me using words...

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:01.040
I won't be able to react otherwise, right?

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.500
This won't do. Rinna-chan's an amateur at this after all...

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.300
She has completely no idea about pictures...

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.620
I will now send this sad-looking melting ice cream...

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.000
It melted...

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.920
Rinna: "This picture is nice! Thank you!"

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.180
Hmm, Rinna-kun, you only have one final chance, alright?

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.080
I'm expecting a good reaction from you...

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.980
I guess I should give her something easier to react to...

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:22.340
How about this? Boss..

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.020
I'm the boss after all

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:24.560
Alright!

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:25.380
LIKE!

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:26.420
I!

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:28.120
SAIIIID!

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:40.100
There's more at the back! This sub was brought to you by Ryogawa!

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:43.320
Until Rinna gives me a good reaction, I'll keep on doing this, you heard?!

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:46.000
