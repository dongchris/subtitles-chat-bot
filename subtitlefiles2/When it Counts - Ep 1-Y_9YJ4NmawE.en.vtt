00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.840
See you guys next week

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:03.980
-Alright, take care yeah?
-Bye
-See you

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:05.220
-Take care

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:08.160
-Hey, you wanna grab a bite to eat?

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:09.880
I was gonna ask a few of the others

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.800
-Uh..

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.360
-Not tonight. Thanks though.

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:14.280
-Alright

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:33.140
Right about now, one of the most terrifying things that could happen to a guy is taking place

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.220
That moment when a good guy,

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:36.660
a nice guy,

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.780
finally works up the courage to tell a girl,

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:41.700
a close friend,

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.120
that he's had feelings for her for a long time

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.760
unsure of whether or not she feels the same

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.780
he finally lets it all out,

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.820
most likely to her surprise

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.300
risking their friendship to see if

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:59.500
maybe, there's a chance they can be something more than friends.

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.420
It's all happening right now

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:02.900
to my friend Matt.

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.700
He's having a long awaited conversation with our other friend,

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:09.620
Anna,

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.440
about his...feelings.

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.340
So, he's been talking to me for months now about this night

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.520
trying to get my opinion as a girl

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.160
The three of us are on a dance team at school

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.380
I'm new this year, but

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.080
apparently he's had a crush on her for a long time

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:27.080
I'm like-

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.020
"Dude, why didn't you say something earlier?

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.960
She probably sees you as a friend by now,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.520
and even if she did like you back at one point,

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:34.960
if you didn't act on it,

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.260
she probably just gave up and moved on."

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.840
Of course, this is like the worst thing that you could say to a guy

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:42.660
He just says,

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.640
"Well she coulda said something first."

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:46.840
But I told him

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.320
He's...sorta intimidating.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.860
But, now like a year later

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:57.120
he finally decides to tell her.

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:59.920
I don't get him.

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:01.840
Anyway,

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.340
I haven't heard from him yet.

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.180
I wonder how it's going.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.960
*phone beeps*

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:16.220
Ooh.

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:22.820
Gotta go. Can't wait to hear all the details.

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.420
-Nice guys finish last.

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:31.540
That's how it is,

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.060
that's how it's always gonna be.

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:35.400
She's probably gonna go date some jerk

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:36.400
she barely even knows,

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.340
and I've been her friend for so long.

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.800
-Maybe after tonight, she'll realize how important you are as a friend

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.520
and maybe she'll come around

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.640
-Hope so.

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:46.880
You're totally right, Tam

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:47.420
I should've just listened to you

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:49.840
I should've just told her from the very beginning

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.820
-Well, I do think it's good to be friends first,

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:53.760
sometimes.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.440
-Not this time.

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:57.260
You know what she said to me?

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:58.340
She said,

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:00.780
"I hope we can still be friends."

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:01.920
And I'm like,

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:03.260
"Say what?!"

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:04.300
-You said that?

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:05.600
-No, but I should've.

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:08.480
-So, are you gonna stay friends?

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:10.260
-If we keep being friends,

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:11.500
that's letting her win.

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:12.900
She gets to move on past this night,

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.100
and keep me at a distance.

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:15.360
That's not fair

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:16.320
If she's gonna reject me,

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.040
she doesn't even deserve my friendship.

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.020
-That's a little harsh man.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:21.300
She didn't do anything wrong.

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:23.000
Unless you're saying that

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.320
not returning your feelings makes her a bad person.

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:27.220
-I just want her to feel bad.

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:28.680
-Nice guy, huh?

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:31.500
Sorry

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:32.440
It's fresh

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:34.320
You're allowed to be upset.

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:36.600
I know what it's like.

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:37.540
-Yeah, man.

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:38.360
We need to stop-

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:39.660
being so nice.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.500
She ju..she just led me on this whole time.

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:44.860
-Well, now you know.

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:47.280
And now you can move on, too.

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:49.200
-Yeah

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:50.860
You're right

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:54.140
Girls are dumb, and I'm not gonna be nice anymore.

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:58.340
-Well, this has been a productive conversation.

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:01.760
-Ahh, thanks for coming guys.

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:03.580
-Yeah, sure. Bye.
-Bye.

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:04.820
-See ya.

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:09.460
*sigh*

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:10.660
-Hey

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:14.720
I know you're really angry right now

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:17.340
and you probably think every girl is evil,

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:21.520
but I really hope this doesn't affect you too much.

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:24.160
-We'll see.

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:25.820
-C'mon, really?

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:27.920
It's just one girl.

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:29.100
You can learn from this,

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:29.780
but

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:31.780
don't take it out on everyone else.

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:34.020
-Yeah.

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:38.960
-Don't think of it as you're missing out on Anna, ok?

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:41.220
Try to think of it as you're dodging her,

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:43.020
because she wasn't right for you.

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:45.700
And there's a reason it's not happening

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:50.560
-Thanks.

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:54.580
Bye.

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:04.780
I wish I were that reason

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:08.060
You always hear a guy say,

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:09.900
"Nice guys finish last."

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:10.940
It's so...

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:12.360
Annoying.

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:14.300
When have you ever heard girls say,

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:16.340
"Nice girls finish last?"

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:20.340
Well, hah, guess what? It happens.

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:23.460
We just keep it to ourselves

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:27.300
Usually when a guy complains about a girl not liking him

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:31.000
it's because he's only focused on her.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.040
He doesn't realize,

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:33.140
or acknowledge,

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:35.400
that there might be someone who does like him.

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:38.720
I guess I'm that girl.

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:44.920
Ever since I joined the team, I always had a thing for Matt.

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:46.860
We got along really well

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:48.460
always joking and stuff

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:50.800
And then,

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:54.220
He started telling everyone on the team I was like his little sister

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:58.320
Not exactly the words you wanna hear when you like a guy

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.920
But he's always been so enamored by Anna that

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:07.660
I don't think he's ever considered that I might like him and

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:11.060
if he has, he's chosen to ignore it.

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:13.900
Which sucks pretty bad, too.

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:18.760
Anyway, what do you guys think about all these guys

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:20.840
complaining that they're finishing last?

00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:24.380
Do you think nice girls finish last, too?

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:27.200
How come we don't complain as much as them?

00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:31.260
Now that he's all angry over Anna,

00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:33.860
I don't know what I should do.
