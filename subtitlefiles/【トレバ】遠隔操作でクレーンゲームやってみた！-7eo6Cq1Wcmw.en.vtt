00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:01.620
Yo!

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:03.980
I'm virtual YouTuber, Kizuna Ai!

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:04.480
And...

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:07.500
Guess what we're doing today!

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:08.300
That's right!

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:09.440
A crane game!

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:10.520
Right now...

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:13.600
...you can play crane game from the internet.

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.000
And this is it!

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.240
Looks like it's called「 TOREBA」

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.940
And, and...!

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:20.720
You get to play for free for your first 3 tries!

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:22.680
Isn't that so economical~?

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:26.120
First we're going to choose which prize we want.

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.700
There's a lot of them aren't there?

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:29.880
Hmmmm

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:32.020
This stuffed animal is cute, isn't it?

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.000
Which one should we do?

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:35.640
This glove thing is cute isn't it?

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.260
"Plush Glove"

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.360
"Kid's size... kid's size..."

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:40.280
I see...

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:40.940
Ah!

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.620
There's a figure here too!

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.940
Do you think I could have my own stuff on here someday?

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:47.380
Which one would be good?

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:48.460
You know...

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.480
I think an easy one would be best.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.600
A Snoopy shoulder bag!

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:54.420
That sounds nice...

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.080
Ah, food would be good right?!

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:59.100
Choco...Baby...Circle...Box...

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.560
Ah, I see...

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:02.980
...this is how it looks like.

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:06.260
I don't know if I want to use my first try on this...

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
This is taking more effort than I thought it would.

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.040
It really is.

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.160
These three tries...

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.200
I don't want to waste them, you know?

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.400
Pizza Pan Cushion!

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.660
Couldn't this trick someone?

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.840
Ah, I see... this button lets me change the angle

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:25.320
Oh, I think I can get this.

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.400
Ah, well... I'm going to look a little more, can't be too naive.

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.400
If you don't think thought through, you might regret later.

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.240
Oh, that looks delicious!

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.100
How do you get this?

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.420
This is kind of, well... not very kind.

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.680
Aren't there anything that I can get in one try?

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.300
Seems like there are no...

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.240
Oh! A rice cooker for one!

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.140
Steamy... rice...

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:53.640
(lol)

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.220
Pretty good, huh? There are more and more people living alone, after all.

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:58.340
Let's try this!

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:03.760
Without further ado... I only have 3 free plays left, so let's play!

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:05.860
Black or white, which one should I choose?

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:10.760
Well, the white one suits my room better right? It's pure white after all.

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.900
So then... We'll aim for A!

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:15.180
Let's start

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:17.160
Sideways..

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.800
Hei!

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.600
WHOA! It moved!

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:22.480
(How exciting...)

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:23.840
Like this...

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.640
The depth is very important

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.700
Like this! Oh, I'm a genius!

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:28.460
Ah!

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:29.240
Ah!

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:30.020
That's what you expet from m...

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.520
Eh! ...  Eh!

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:31.020
Oh! ... This ...

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.620
Genius!

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:32.320
Ha! ... Ho!

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.540
(?)

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.000
Wait a second... what the heck is this?

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.360
Isn't this unfair?

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.080
The arm, the arm is too weak.

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.500
Ah, oh well! I can do this!

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.200
Last time I opened it too far...

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.140
How about this much?

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.200
Whoa! Doesn't this seem good?

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.120
It might depend if it has any extra weight to it

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.780
Oh!

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.880
Take this!

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.860
This much!

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:04.260
This...... mu..ch!

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.020
If it doesn't move here, I'll have to ask an employee for help...

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.700
Ah!

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:12.380
Oh!

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:13.620
Oh...

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:16.380
Oh.................

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:17.880
I see...

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.920
I see...

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.820
Eh? Tha.... t's .... it?

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.100
Hahaha...

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:29.860
No more ponts to play....

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:30.600
...right...

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:31.960
No more!

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:36.200
There won't be any problems if I upload video where I didn't succeed right?

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.600
If I delete this app, can I play it agai...

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.840
Well, my skill might be not enough or maybe I haven't study enough.

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:43.160
I'll definitely get it next time!

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:43.860
Everyone!

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:45.100
If you like to play

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.180
Paying attention to the range for the claw could be a good idea

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:51.300
It seems like you are able to spectate other people play

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:53.500
Observe other people play

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:55.940
"This should be about here"

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:56.660
like that.

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:58.420
Might have a better result

00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:59.940
Maybe next time...

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.260
I'd challenge it again!

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:02.980
Do you have any crane game tips?

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:05.260
"It should be like this" kinda

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:11.540
If you have some advice, please, teach Kizuna Ai! I'd be really happy.

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:14.060
Well, that's it for today! Bye Bye~
