00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.060
Hello everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai here!

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:04.300
Hey everyone...

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:06.620
Do you understand a maiden's heart?

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:08.420
Really~?

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:09.540
Because for today...

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:10.920
I'm going to try this app!

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:11.640
♪ De, den! ♪

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:13.100
"Furare Kaihi" 
(Break-Up Dodge)

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:19.460
This is an app which can make you dodge the crisis of being found cheating!

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:24.140
But if you understand a maiden's heart, this app would be a piece of cake!

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.440
Certainly, though I've never played it…

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:27.440
So for today...

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:33.760
I'll teach you guys the aspects of a maiden's heart...

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:35.480
So now, let's do it!

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.860
1st.STAGE: Toothbrush
*buzzer sound*

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:38.900
Oooh!

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.660
“You're really cute, you know? ♥”

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:44.480
Hehehe! Thank you!

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.240
Ohh!

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.760
"Girlfriend: You're so sweet Ai-kun!"

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.600
“Girlfriend: Can I use the washroom?”

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:54.740
"Yes...♥"

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.280
Why's there a heart for every sentence? That's disgusting...

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:58.760
Wow, her face in the mirror is really scary!

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:00.220
Ah!

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:01.320
Ahh!

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.240
Toothbrush...

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.080
"Girlfriend: Just a moment, Ai-kun...?"

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.940
*ding*

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:09.080
Fight!

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.140
Why do I have two of them? One's for cleaning, yes!

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.560
"Oh, damn it...! Another girlfriend of mine left it..."

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.060
Why the hell do you need another girlfriend?!

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.620
That's cheating!

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.260
That's not what you call "another girlfriend"!

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:23.880
"I have to come with an excuse and get this over with!"

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:25.380
Men are really trash, right?

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.240
"Girlfriend: Why do you have two toothbrushes?"

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.020
It’s not "Using two of them at once"...

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.700
It's not "Prepared a new one" because it’s been used...

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.340
I'll choose I've "Forgotten to throw away the old one"!

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:40.000
Isn't this perfect?!

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:41.840
Eh, this is kind of scary...

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.100
"Girlfriend: It still looks like it could be used, though" *laughs*

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.720
If I say "The bristles aren't straight, so…” she'll probably reply with “They look fine to me...”

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.200
"That toothbrush... wasn't fitting to my teeth"

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:00.680
It’s been used a lot?!

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.020
If I don't even know the condition of that toothbrush...

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:04.520
How am I supposed to avoid the crisis!?

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:06.420
*ding, ding, ding, ding, ding*

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.520
Is this the end? Am I done? I think I am!

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:12.900
"Excuse failed"

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.020
Retry! I'm gonna do this!

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.780
Ah...

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:21.140
This game is kind, it indicates properly that you've already chosen that option...

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.720
So it's not "Forgotten to throw away the old one” nor is it "Prepared a new one"...

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.780
I'm going to try this, "I'm using two of them at once"

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.760
"Girlfriend: You’re joking, right?"

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.300
“It’s more efficient to use them together”

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.560
"Sorry, this is a friend's", that doesn't sound very...

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:38.320
"I'm putting extra care in brushing my teeth so I use two of them...”

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:39.500
"One is for..."

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.800
"Removing all the..."

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:43.760
Dirty?

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.660
"Scraps better in the spaces between the teeth!"

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.980
"And the other one is for cleaning the actual teeth to finish off"

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:50.120
Let's choose this?

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.460
But she’ll say "You can't clean the tooth crown with this"...

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.700
I'm using both of them, that's better, right?

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.200
*laughs* Seriously? He's really doing that...

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.560
"Girlfriend: Filthy...! Don't come any closer!"

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.660
With this, she didn't found the cheating, did she?

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:03.680
*ding, ding, ding, ding, ding*

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:04.860
Eh? It doesn't work?

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.600
Eh?!

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.500
Eh? It doesn't work? She didn't find out about the cheating!

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:11.000
*ding*

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:13.580
I don't understand a maiden's heart~

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.380
I'll teach you guys the aspects of a maiden's heart

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.860
*slowed down* I’m going to teach you...

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.020
Let's go with "I set it up," then~

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.120
I set it up for you!

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.400
The bristles aren't stra... *laughs*

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.300
It's... It's that kind of merchandise!

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.040
"Girlfriend: But the brush has food scraps on it"

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:39.600
HA?!

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.480
Hey, describe what kind of toothbrush it is!

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:44.500
*ding, ding, ding, ding, ding*

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:45.180
*inhales*

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:49.020
I don't know if it's dirty with green laver or not!
(Green laver: Edible green algae)

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:52.640
There's no way that I’m going to be stuck on the first stage...

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:55.380
Thinking logically, I've forgotten to throw it away...

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:59.240
"Girlfriend: It still looks useable, though"

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:03.020
"I change them as soon as the bristles stop being straight."

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:05.660
"Girlfriend: Is that so~?"

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:06.160
Ah!

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:06.900
Here it come!

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:09.760
The first option ended well, didn't it?

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:11.260
How embarrassing...

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:14.020
2nd.STAGE: Peeking
*buzzer sound*

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:14.700
“Peeking…”

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:16.060
Peek!

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:17.120
Peek...

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:20.500
Man, they're so in love!
“Girlfriend: Where should we go after this?”

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:22.400
“Hmm?”

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:25.420
“Wherever you want to go ♥” Heheh~

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:26.600
I was joking

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:28.880
"Girlfriend: H-Hey...!"

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.080
Is she sulking? She doesn’t really have to!

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:34.240
Ah...

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:35.440
Aaah...

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:36.920
Wait, are they gonna fight?

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.120
Ah, they are gonna definitely gonna fight!

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:41.040
He might be thinking “Man, she’s huge” or something like that, right?

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:41.720
*ding*

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:42.540
Fight!

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:46.640
"Girlfriend: You were looking, right?"

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.080
"Hmm? Looking at what?"

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.740
“Girlfriend: A cute girl just walked past”... But wait, that’s not cheating, right?

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:58.280
“No way! Where? Where!?”

00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:59.420
Isn’t that you?

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:04.260
“Are you jealous?”

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:08.580
I made her angry, I'm sorry...

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:09.780
I'm sorry...

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:11.120
I'm sorry...

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:12.600
I'm so sorry...

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:13.100
*ding*

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:15.540
But wasn’t I on the right track?

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.160
"You were looking, right?"

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:19.600
“Ah, I sure was!” I was looking at you...

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:22.080
"Girlfriend: What were you looking at?"

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:23.260
Oh, it's like that?

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:26.080
"Breasts", "Rear", "Face", they all look like bad choices...

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:29.040
Her rear?

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:30.800
How.. how difficult...

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:32.780
"Girlfriend: I'll get mad..."

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:35.000
"D-don't be an ridiculous! I was referring to the skirt, of course, the skirt!"

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:37.040
"Girlfriend: What about my skirt?"

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:37.540
Ah!

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:38.540
This is...

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:41.040
Which one should I....?

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:46.520
“Ah, I just thought that kind of black dress would look really good on you…”

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:47.820
“Girlfriend: It wasn't black, though, it was gray...”

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:49.080
“Girlfriend: You were staring at her butt after all, you damn pervert”

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:50.180
*ding, ding, ding, ding, ding*

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:52.580
How am I supposed to know that!?

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:54.720
Just let it pass!

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:55.640
*ding*

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:57.020
I can do it, I can do it, I can do it...

00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:58.340
Which..?

00:05:58.920 --> 00:05:59.920
“I was looking!”

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:03.100
“Breasts!”

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:05.600
Ah!
"Girlfriend: “How disgusting!”

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:08.500
“How cute was she?”

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:09.360
"Girlfriend: ..."

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:12.740
“As cute as you!” Did I get her?

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:13.240
I think I did!

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:14.400
"Girlfriend: “Oh, what are you saying? Stop it!”

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:14.900
I got her!
"Girlfriend: “Oh, what are you saying? Stop it!”

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:15.600
Good!

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:16.420
Good!

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:17.400
I'm the best!

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.320
Women are annoying but if you give them what they want they are a piece of cake!

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:23.120
Man, what do you think?

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:25.280
As expected from the A.I!

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:27.080
Now you understand maiden’s heart now, right?

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:30.300
So everyone should also properly learn more about a maiden’s heart...

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:31.700
Although it's not right to deceive them...

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:33.340
But in case you find yourself in any trouble...

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:34.960
It's good if they forgive you, right?

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:37.700
This was Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai!

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:38.540
See you later!

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.260
There's more at the end!

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:43.640
Translated by M1Ck鈴木, 963852, Rafer45, Vortex

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:54.340
Man, if you're that annoying, it's clear that you'll end up being cheated!

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:55.380
Even if that's not right!
