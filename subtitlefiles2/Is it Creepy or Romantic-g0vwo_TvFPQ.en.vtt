Alley, Victoria, Mm-hmm? I need your advice

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.979
So you know how I've been talking to Carolyn, her birthday is coming up

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:17.920
So I want to do something super romantic for her any ideas. Oh

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.529
That is so sweet

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:26.559
Okay, so I have an idea. So there's this guy that I really like and he remembered when I told him that I love breakfast

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:33.639
One morning, he wakes up super early and brings a homemade breakfast straight to my front door. It was so romantic of him ah

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:36.579
that's the sweetest thing! You get all the boys!

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:42.069
It's a really good idea. Oh, but you know what? That could actually be really bad too. What do you mean, okay,

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:44.229
So there's this other guy that really liked me

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:48.070
And I guess he stalked me and found out I like breakfast, and one morning

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:50.080
He pounds on my front door and wakes me up

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:55.329
And he's standing there holding a waffle and stuff, trying to force me to eat it like a total creeper.

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:01.480
Ugh, I hat when that happens, that happens to me all the time. That was the exact same thing that happened in the first story

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.380
Why is that creepy?

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:05.380
It's completely different

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.390
yeah, oh, okay um what else could I do? Oh, okay?

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.330
So how about this? So that one guy that I liked, he secretly

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.620
Coordinated with one of my roommates to borrow my spare car keys while I was at the office,

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:24.310
He put a bouquet of flowers and stuffed animals in my car and surprised me after work. That is so romantic.

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:27.759
Yeah, you totally don't deserve him. That's a really good one

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:29.760
And I used that. But then again,

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:35.200
so the other guy he like, somehow made a copy of my keys when I wasn't looking or something and

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:41.379
one night when I was working really late he found out where I worked and left a bunch of flowers inside my car and

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.019
Then he jumped out of the shadows and freaks me out

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:54.788
Ew, what a creep. I would have run him over. I tried. He's really fast. I know but I'm a better driver

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:00.700
So, what okay again same exact story you're just using different adjectives to describe the same event

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:07.390
No, It's not the same at all the same at all. Fine, what if I do something really simple?

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:09.679
like

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:11.679
Send her a card. Oh,

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.209
That could be cool, cute and simple. So the first guy, he did that for me once

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.559
How do you get so many guys? But then again

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:36.639
He sounds like a serial killer. I know right, just stop both of you

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:41.529
Okay, both these guys are doing the exact same thing, but just because you're attracted to one of them

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:46.539
It's romantic, and you're turned off by the other it's a creeper. Just admit it. That's what you're saying

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:55.089
Um was he even listening to your story? I don't think he was, yeah he wasn't listening at all. Oh my God, okay

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:57.090
I'm just gonna figure it out on my own

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.230
Okay, I mean don't ask for help. Yeah, no totally

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:06.550
So did Wes do anything for your birthday?

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.840
He did actually, he surprised me with breakfast for my favorite restaurant

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:13.029
He had a bouquet of flowers sent to my work

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:18.129
And he left a handmade card underneath the windshield wiper of my car. Aw, that is so sweet

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:23.919
Yeah, it really was so desperate. I was just gonna say that. Yeah, whatever I'm over it

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.040
