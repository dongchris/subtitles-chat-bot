Hello everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai here!

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:19.900
Man, I got a lot of messages saying "We want to see other hairstyles of you!"

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.420
You guys just keep saying it, so...

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.520
See... Isn't it almost autumn?

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:27.120
So I told myself "Let's try some other hairstyles!"

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.340
So... I'll be trying lots of anime character's hairstyles!

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:32.920
So with that, let's do this!

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.460
What kind of anime character’s hairstyle should I do first?

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:39.580
Hmmmm...

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.220
Ah! I have long hair, right? So...

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.140
Maybe I should do a character with short hair?

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:46.840
With that being said! Here!

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:47.460
There you go!

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:48.220
♪ Chan, chan! ♪

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:51.540
How is it? Do you know what character is this?

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.700
She’s from "The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya"...

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.340
Nagato Yuki-senpai's hairstyle! Chan, chan!

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.580
How is it? Not even close?

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.380
Eh... it doesn't suit me...

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:06.460
It would fit me if I change the color!

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:08.020
Pink is the color, right?

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.840
What do you think?

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.400
There is no way to enliven it...

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.020
Yes, unacceptable!

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:13.200
Eeein~

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:14.320
Hey, you know...

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:15.340
It's that...

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:18.200
As I thought, short hair is good too, but...

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.635
Because there are a lot of varieties of short hair...

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.820
I want to search for a short hairstyle that fits me!

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:23.320
So...

00:01:23.325 --> 00:01:24.940
It is about anime characters, right?

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:28.640
I want to go with a popular character that’s still remaining

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:29.960
That being said! Tada!

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:31.680
How is it?

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:33.120
It's white!

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:37.320
When the room is looking so white, you can't really see what's what, right?

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.980
Do you know this character?

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:41.180
The correct answer is...

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:42.060
♪ Cha, chan! ♪

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.340
Gintoki Sakata from “Gintama”!

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:45.600
Well, ehm...

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.620
Let's just give up on that one

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:49.020
Eeein!

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:50.540
A.I.Channel!

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:53.500
With that, welcome to my hair catalogue show!

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:54.260
Cha, chan!

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:56.000
Maybe like this?

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:56.760
Tada!

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.680
Weeell!

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.280
As expected, my current hairstyle is the best, don't you think?

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.520
Ah! But I maybe want to try out a ponytail!

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.400
