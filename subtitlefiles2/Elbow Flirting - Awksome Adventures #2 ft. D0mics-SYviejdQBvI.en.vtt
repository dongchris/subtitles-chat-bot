00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:05.580
Hey guys, Chris here!

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:10.000
So, the first time I can remember having a crush on a girl was in the fourth grade.

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:16.040
Her name was Liz and she was the first girl who ever gave me that butterflies-in-my-stomach feeling.

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:21.820
And man, she would make me so nervous that I couldn't even look in her general direction.

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:23.880
If I ever found her advancing towards me,

00:00:24.028 --> 00:00:29.520
I would pretend that I was interested in something else, anything else, like other kids...

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.100
Who weren't talking to me...

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:35.519
Trees, the sky, I mean, she had that strong of an effect on me.

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:39.149
So it was the first day of school and in this particular classroom

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:41.190
we were assigned where to sit.

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:46.889
Me and the rest of the fourth graders were standing on either side of the classroom waiting for our teacher to fill in the seats

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.919
one by one. I clearly remember praying in my head:

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:54.380
"Please please please God, let me be assigned a seat next to Liz."

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:56.129
After the first row filled up,

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.489
I heard the teacher call out my name, and as I was walking to my desk

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.329
I kept repeating that prayer.

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:05.500
"Please please please," and sure enough, as I sat down,

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.459
I heard the teacher say, "Next to Chris is

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:10.960
Liz.

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.110
Time. Slowed. Down.

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.709
I was completely frozen, even though in my head

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.519
I was jumping up and down and celebrating like it was my birthday, high-fiving myself

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:25.619
I could hear her sit down right next to me and from that second on I lost all ability

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.339
to look towards the right side of the room. So we received our first assignment

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:32.519
It was a fill-in the-blanks kind of a worksheet. You know,

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.700
I don't really remember because my brain wasn't working very well at the moment

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:41.909
But, I eventually start to fill it out and as I did my arm slowly moved to the right and

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.460
That's when it happened.

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:51.299
My elbow lightly touched her elbow, and then what happened next was beyond my wildest dream:

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.000
Liz didn't move her elbow away

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.170
We were touching elbows, and she just kept it there.

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.900
I mean, do you know what that kind of physical contact

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:03.200
meant to a fourth grader?

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:05.620
My mind was blown.

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.900
I was super excited, but again. I was too nervous to look in her direction.

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:12.238
So I just stared down at my worksheet

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.940
I don't know how much time passed as we played footsies with our elbows,

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.520
but I can tell you it was pure ecstasy

00:02:20.109 --> 00:02:21.870
I varied the amount of pressure

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.300
I rubbed it back and forth, and she didn't move away. She was totally into it.

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.769
It was a clear sign that she liked it too

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:35.339
I think I matured into manhood at that moment. So as we sat there sensually touching elbows

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.639
I heard something that confused the hell out of me.

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:44.000
It was Liz's laughter, but it was coming from the front of the classroom.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.139
I thought to myself. "How is that possible?"

00:02:47.139 --> 00:02:50.549
So I slowly and coolly looked down towards my elbow...

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.340
and there it was.

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.989
It turns out that Liz's desk was just a little higher than mine.

00:02:58.689 --> 00:03:00.340
About an inch or two

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:05.080
My elbow was touching the edge of her desk the entire time.

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.800
HER DESK, an inanimate object.

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.049
The rest of the classroom had no idea that

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:12.720
I was sexually maturing right in front of them,

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.929
as I was rubbing my elbow with a freaking desk

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.840
No offense, desk

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.150
I was so embarrassed.

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:24.839
Most of all, I was really disappointed it wasn't Liz.

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.393
Anyways, my family moved away to another city, shortly after, and...

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.860
I never knew what happened to Liz.

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:36.800
But if you're watching Liz I just wanted to let you know my elbow says hi.

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.300
And he can't wait to actually rub your elbow one day.
