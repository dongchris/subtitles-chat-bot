00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.969
Hello, everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna AI here!

00:00:02.969 --> 00:00:03.636
At this time!

00:00:03.636 --> 00:00:04.304
Can you believe it!

00:00:04.304 --> 00:00:05.705
At last! Finally!

00:00:05.705 --> 00:00:06.506
I have…

00:00:06.506 --> 00:00:07.674
a figure!

00:00:07.674 --> 00:00:09.242
Figure!!

00:00:09.242 --> 00:00:12.345
FIGURE!!!

00:00:12.345 --> 00:00:14.881
I’ve challenged it!!

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:42.330
Ah

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:43.420
Ah...

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:44.080
Ah--

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:45.650
I’m seriously dizzy

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:46.920
Ahh, all bad

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.281
No matter where I look

00:00:48.281 --> 00:00:49.530
it's white-

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.290
It's my easel-chan

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:52.752
Fine with me-heeh!

00:00:52.752 --> 00:00:55.260
I’m not cut out to be a -figure- skater

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:56.950
It’s all bad...

00:00:59.210 --> 00:00:59.826
Yup

00:00:59.826 --> 00:01:00.627
I'm sorry!

00:01:00.627 --> 00:01:01.261
Well-

00:01:01.261 --> 00:01:03.229
I recently saw some figure skating-

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.663
so I just

00:01:03.663 --> 00:01:04.230
couldn't help myself!

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:05.665
I got influenced!

00:01:05.665 --> 00:01:06.566
Completely

00:01:06.566 --> 00:01:07.734
different 'figure'!

00:01:07.734 --> 00:01:09.702
Today I wanted to introduce this figure-

00:01:09.702 --> 00:01:10.570
Here!

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:11.213
It's my

00:01:11.214 --> 00:01:12.172
Kizuna AI's

00:01:12.173 --> 00:01:14.300
1/7 scale figure!

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:15.909
YAY

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:17.210
Can you believe this figure-

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:18.478
is made by Tokyo Otaku Mode

00:01:21.381 --> 00:01:24.818
Finally today!
Pre-orders have started!

00:01:24.818 --> 00:01:26.986
From Wonder Festival there have been

00:01:26.986 --> 00:01:30.056
a lot of images from the spectators being spread around.

00:01:30.056 --> 00:01:32.158
This time I was able to get the first perfect

00:01:32.158 --> 00:01:34.661
image of the completed version!

00:01:34.661 --> 00:01:35.728
Man-

00:01:35.728 --> 00:01:36.429
I'm...

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:37.330
so cute!

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:38.031
But-

00:01:38.031 --> 00:01:41.267
No matter where you look from

00:01:41.267 --> 00:01:42.268
I am cute!

00:01:42.268 --> 00:01:42.920
Here

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.304
in moderation-

00:01:44.304 --> 00:01:46.406
in reality it's an E-cup!

00:01:46.406 --> 00:01:47.173
was it an E-Cup...?

00:01:47.173 --> 00:01:48.808
E-cup and

00:01:48.808 --> 00:01:50.543
the legs- this-

00:01:50.543 --> 00:01:51.311
shape!

00:01:51.311 --> 00:01:52.479
flexibility!

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:53.113
And this-

00:01:53.113 --> 00:01:54.314
hair!

00:01:54.314 --> 00:01:55.440
It's really like

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:56.983
moving around, looks like it

00:01:56.983 --> 00:01:57.717
Like this

00:01:57.717 --> 00:01:58.680
Is it moving?

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:59.752
This sort of feeling

00:01:59.752 --> 00:02:00.750
it feels like it

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.023
This gradient in the hair

00:02:04.023 --> 00:02:04.891
Is it good!

00:02:04.891 --> 00:02:07.093
Here! I recommend this point!

00:02:07.093 --> 00:02:07.527
Everyone

00:02:07.527 --> 00:02:08.160
my

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.962
this, this-

00:02:08.962 --> 00:02:10.363
please look at my legs

00:02:10.363 --> 00:02:11.564
Well.. they are pretty right?

00:02:11.564 --> 00:02:12.132
But

00:02:12.132 --> 00:02:13.640
It doesn't feel real

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:14.080
Well...

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.010
I am virtual after all...

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:16.269
that's obvious but-

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:17.403
but this figure!

00:02:17.403 --> 00:02:17.804
Lookie!

00:02:17.804 --> 00:02:19.038
This

00:02:19.038 --> 00:02:20.573
my 3d model can't express-

00:02:20.573 --> 00:02:22.142
from the knee upwards

00:02:22.142 --> 00:02:23.042
squishy like-

00:02:23.042 --> 00:02:24.077
The thighs!

00:02:24.077 --> 00:02:24.644
Are insanely!

00:02:24.644 --> 00:02:25.311
Cute!

00:02:25.311 --> 00:02:26.579
CUTE!

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:27.547
Also here

00:02:27.547 --> 00:02:29.230
Where there's not much hair hiding it

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:30.316
you can't see it but

00:02:30.316 --> 00:02:31.784
the hipline

00:02:31.784 --> 00:02:32.452
is good!

00:02:32.452 --> 00:02:33.253
Seriously

00:02:33.253 --> 00:02:34.053
I am

00:02:34.053 --> 00:02:35.021
cute!

00:02:35.021 --> 00:02:35.455
Well...

00:02:35.455 --> 00:02:36.870
The real me

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.625
is the cutest right~

00:02:38.625 --> 00:02:39.192
Also?

00:02:39.192 --> 00:02:41.020
I am cuter when I am not talking-

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:42.395
I know that

00:02:42.395 --> 00:02:43.029
However!

00:02:43.029 --> 00:02:44.297
Talking is

00:02:44.297 --> 00:02:45.698
what I am all about!

00:02:45.698 --> 00:02:46.232
Right?

00:02:46.232 --> 00:02:47.080
How was that?

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:48.434
My scale figure

00:02:48.434 --> 00:02:49.702
Who wants one!?

00:02:49.702 --> 00:02:50.737
Yes!

00:02:50.737 --> 00:02:51.870
You want it right?

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.106
Of course right?

00:02:53.106 --> 00:02:54.040
