Did Robin wish
you happy birthday?

00:05:57.189 --> 00:05:58.557
No.

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:00.092
Why does everyone keep
asking me that?

00:06:00.125 --> 00:06:02.728
It's almost impossible not to
wish someone a happy birthday.

00:06:02.761 --> 00:06:04.730 size:78% position:39%
You know, I mean Facebook
puts it on your phone.

00:06:04.763 --> 00:06:07.400
I mean it's gotta be a big deal,
the year an ex-girlfriend

00:06:07.433 --> 00:06:09.702
doesn't hit you up anymore
to wish you a happy birthday.

00:06:09.735 --> 00:06:12.638 align:start position:0%
I mean, that means
she's totally over you.

00:06:12.671 --> 00:06:15.408 size:75% position:63%
Look, I wasn't expecting
to hear from her.

00:06:15.441 --> 00:06:16.742 size:53% position:73%
Although it would
have been nice.

00:06:16.775 --> 00:06:18.644 size:88% position:44% line:85%
Yeah well, Robin's not nice.

00:06:16.775 --> 00:06:18.644 align:start size:25% position:75%
Hey.

00:06:18.677 --> 00:06:20.713 line:85%
I can say that, but you can't.

00:06:18.677 --> 00:06:20.713 align:start position:0%

00:06:20.746 --> 00:06:22.581 align:start position:0%
can you imagine if you
were still with her?

00:06:22.614 --> 00:06:24.984 align:start position:0%
I mean, she would throw
the most amazing birthday party

00:06:25.017 --> 00:06:27.420 size:75% position:38%
for Robin. And you would
have been okay with it.

00:06:27.453 --> 00:06:29.488 align:start position:0%

00:07:01.019 --> 00:07:03.656 line:85%

Wow, Swimfan. Uh, yeah,
that was Carl.

00:07:12.898 --> 00:07:17.570
Carl wanted more,
and I wasn't ready, so I left.

00:07:17.603 --> 00:07:22.141
And long story short, he started
seeing a close friend of mine.

00:07:22.174 --> 00:07:24.477 align:start size:47% position:53% line:85%
Shut up.

00:07:22.174 --> 00:07:24.477 size:75% position:38%

That is so dramatic.

00:07:30.048 --> 00:07:32.485 size:88% position:44%
Uh, no, it wasn't like that.

00:07:32.518 --> 00:07:35.488 size:84% position:42%
Allison was like
my little sister in college

00:07:35.521 --> 00:07:37.623 size:75% position:38%
and she was very upfront
about the whole thing.

00:07:37.656 --> 00:07:39.725 size:78% position:61%
Still I would feel really
weird if I were you.

00:07:39.758 --> 00:07:42.495 align:start position:0%
Obviously it's not what
I had planned on happening,

00:07:42.528 --> 00:07:46.665
but neither was being almost 30
and moving back to my hometown,

00:07:46.698 --> 00:07:50.236 align:start position:0%

it's nothing I can't handle.
