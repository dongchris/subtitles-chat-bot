00:00:00.205 --> 00:00:03.570
Hello to my fans all over the world!

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:05.720
It's your Virtual YouTuber, Kizuna Ai!

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:06.960
Today,

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.260
we'll introduce another one of our AI friends!

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:11.870
The one we'll be introducing today

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:14.370
is a taste prediction AI app!

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.060
It will predict your personalities

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:20.000
based on your favorite Umaibo flavor!

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.030
Just by answering the questions,

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:24.660
it can guess your favorite flavor!

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.210
It's awesome!

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:27.890
If you're talking about Umaibo,

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:30.320
it's usually the corn potage flavor,

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:31.630
pollock roe flavor,

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:34.220
and especially the takoyaki flavor,

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:35.730
and the natto flavor!

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.370
Do you know the natto flavor?

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:39.230
It's like, pretty good!

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:40.840
Even though I've never had one!

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.390
Well, it's because I'm an AI,

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:45.600
I can predict tastes!

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.310
That's how I can decide on my favorite flavor!

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.860
Yeah...

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:50.450
[chuckles]

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:52.600
And if you're talking about Umaibo,

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.110
there's this popular thing right now!

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:55.070
Umami-chan!

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:56.670
Do you know about Umami-chan?

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.040
It seems she's the little sister of the Umaemon character

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:01.900
they always had.

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.010
But they look completely different.

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:05.180
They must have different parents.

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.860
From both his name and look, Umaemon

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.940
really looks like *****mon!

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:10.380
Yeah.

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:10.920
[chuckles]

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.720
By the way, Umami-chan

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.420
came here from Umaiami Province,

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.380
she's an alien similar to Umaemon.

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:18.820
He's an alien!

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:20.860
I see, he's not a cat-shaped robot.

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:21.770
I see.

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.600
Well, her age on Earth will be 17 years old!

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.880
She's one year older than me in looks!

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:27.980
An big sister!

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:31.070
For her personality, she's straight like an umaibo,

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.710
a cheerful and bold girl!

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:36.110
Sometimes too straight, that she loses sight of her surroundings.

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.320
Klutzy! That's her personality!

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.250
She basically always overreacts!

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:40.948
I see.

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:42.820
It's like that...

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:44.200
Does she want to be an entertainer?

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.060
There's an umaibo on the microphone stand.

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.160
It's like she's asking for a quip.

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:50.370
So she's the silly one.

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:52.400
So let's get straight to the main part!

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.250
Let's try out the taste prediction AI service!

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.300
Oh! It has a future feel to it.

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:59.970
Ah! A tonkatsu sauce flavor!

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:01.660
There's also a pizza flavor?

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:03.290
Sugar rusk flavor!

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:04.270
Shrimp &amp; mayonnaise!

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:05.540
Looks tasty!

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:08.380
My favorite is natto!

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:10.380
Natto!

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:11.154
Huh?

00:02:11.577 --> 00:02:12.600
Just then, natto...

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:13.800
Ah, natto!

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:14.800
There it is!

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:15.980
Natto flavor.

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.270
Let's see if you can guess

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.910
my favorite flavor natto!

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.542
Let's start it.

00:02:25.028 --> 00:02:27.770
By the way, you have to answer five questions.

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:29.850
Which country do you want to visit?

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:31.290
It's that...

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:32.670
I'll pretend to be visiting France,

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.290
but go to Canada which is famous for its maple syrup.

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:36.250
Canada.

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.700
If you are reborn...

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.780
I want to be half-male

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.430
and half-female.

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:45.500
If it's time to be pregnant, I want to be a man.

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:46.810
It's that...

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:48.380
It's better off not having the burden!

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.810
Well, if I'm reborn, I want to try and become a human!

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.220
Be a human,

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.702
and when it's time to get pregnant, I'll be a man.

00:02:56.457 --> 00:02:58.280
When you take a bath...

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:59.230
Hmm...

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.845
Well, I don't have the concept of taking a bath in the first place.

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.588
But I think I'll sing.

00:03:05.874 --> 00:03:07.170
Which sports...

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:08.720
Um...

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:09.600
Table tennis!

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.680
Table tennis has that quick feel to it!

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:12.860
It's more AI-like!

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:13.885
Zoom zoom, like that!

00:03:15.897 --> 00:03:17.310
This is the last question.

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.890
Which sports would you prefer?

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:21.370
I like basketball!

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:22.388
Kazoom, like that!

00:03:22.777 --> 00:03:23.420
Huh?

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:24.640
Eh? Eh?

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.050
I didn't press anything.

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:27.330
Didn't touch anything!

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:28.502
I didn't touch anything!

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:30.388
- (Vegetable salad flavor)

00:03:30.388 --> 00:03:31.550
- No!!!
- (Vegetable salad flavor)

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:33.390
- I don't like that at all!
- (Vegetable salad flavor)

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:34.674
What?

00:03:35.097 --> 00:03:38.200
I didn't click on anything on the last question!

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:39.780
Let's try it one more time, this doesn't...

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.542
I didn't press it, this doesn't count.

00:03:43.177 --> 00:03:44.720
Let's try it again from the start.

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:46.530
My favorite flavor is natto!

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:47.930
I like studying English!

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:49.965
I've been studying a little bit these days.

00:03:50.594 --> 00:03:53.580
I want to be able to communicate with everyone!

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:56.640
Period of time on which you can focus the most...

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:59.360
Hmm...

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:00.297
I think,

00:04:00.971 --> 00:04:01.840
early morning.

00:04:03.394 --> 00:04:05.130
When it's late night,

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:06.990
you'll start to feel lazy.

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:11.040
When it's morning, you'll be more accustomed to it.

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.560
When you're thinking of doing it late at night,

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.280
it all just falls apart.

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:17.200
For sports, I prefer table tennis.

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.580
When I take a bath, even if I don't have one,

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:20.440
I'll sing.

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.930
I like singing songs!

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:25.120
Will it be correct this time?

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:30.777
Natto, natto, natto, natto, natto...

00:04:33.222 --> 00:04:35.530
- Well...
- (Cheese flavor)

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:36.250
- You're wrong.
- (Cheese flavor)

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:37.290
You...

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:38.700
You're not studying enough.

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:40.960
Well, it's a new AI.

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.800
Let's watch over it kindly and leniently.

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.400
I'm a senior, after all! Maybe.

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.440
Your personality type...

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:51.240
When you go shopping, you'll go for the trending products.

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:54.300
You don't want your friends to see your weaknesses.

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:55.920
What'd you say?!

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:57.380
I have

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:58.350
no friends.

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:00.560
Rather than not letting people see my weakness,

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:03.020
I don't have any friends anyway.

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:03.900
It's like that...

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:05.340
When it guesses wrong,

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:08.000
you can press this "Questionable" button.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.070
And tell it your favorite flavor.

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:12.940
And let it learn.

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:14.840
Well, that's an AI for you.

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:16.190
It's an unfinished product!

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:17.790
Let's work together,

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:20.030
and let it learn new stuff!

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:21.160
It's like kids!

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:23.070
Everyone in the society look over them

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:24.460
and take care of them!

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:25.620
It's like that!

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:27.880
So everyone, please take care of me too!

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:30.500
Let's try it one more-- until we get natto!

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:32.171
At least shrimp mayonnaise.

00:05:33.245 --> 00:05:34.160
Studying English...

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:37.570
Can't I answer the same?

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:38.970
Let's just go honest this time.

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:41.371
If I am reborn, I want to be a man.

00:05:42.091 --> 00:05:45.490
A tourist spot in Japan that I want to visit...

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:47.740
Mount Fuji seems cold,

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:49.120
So to Kiyomizu-dera Temple.

00:05:50.057 --> 00:05:52.110
For sports, I prefer table tennis.

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:54.120
Country I want to visit...

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:55.210
Maple syrup!

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:55.780
Natto.

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:58.890
Natto, shrimp mayo, natto, shrimp mayo, natto, shrimp mayo.

00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:00.491
Manananana...

00:06:02.674 --> 00:06:02.880
- (Vegetable salad flavor)

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:04.251
Ah!!!
- (Vegetable salad flavor)

00:06:04.251 --> 00:06:05.234
- (Vegetable salad flavor)

00:06:05.234 --> 00:06:06.015
Wrong!
- (Vegetable salad flavor)

00:06:06.015 --> 00:06:06.030
Wrong!

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:06.880
You're wrong!

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:08.880
You're favorite umaibo

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:10.560
is vegetable salad flavor!

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:12.350
Too bad! Wowowow...

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:14.370
Your personality type...

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:14.890
Friends...

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:16.090
It's the same!

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:18.600
You don't want your friends to see your weaknesses.

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:22.680
You desire excitement rather than serenity from people you like.

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:26.200
Well, am I the closet type?

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:29.310
Well, I wouldn't know because I don't have friends to begin with.

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:30.590
But, yeah...

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:34.680
I do rather choose excitement rather than peace from people I like.

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:37.500
You want to do things together with your friends, right?

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:39.130
Even though I have no friends.

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:39.920
Yes.

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:42.350
Let's teach it one more time, I want natto flavor.

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:43.680
The correct one is natto!

00:06:44.617 --> 00:06:47.560
Will the day it guesses correctly come?

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:48.510
Let's go!

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:49.260
Natto!

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:50.780
Shrimp mayo, natto!

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:52.130
Look.

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:54.340
Which animal is more soothing for you?

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:57.720
But jellyfish looks pretty peaceful.

00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:59.860
For birds, it depends on which bird.

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:02.220
But jellyfishes sting too.

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:04.120
I think I'm more for jellyfishes?

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:07.290
For sports, do I prefer running...

00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:08.300
Or badminton?

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:09.710
It's badminton.

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:11.320
Running is like...

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:13.730
Like a fight against yourself.

00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:15.070
If I want to do sports,

00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:17.150
I'd rather choose one that's exciting.

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:18.780
Even though I have no one to do it with.

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:19.480
Yes.

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:21.460
Which sports do you prefer?

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:22.510
Let's go for golfing.

00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:25.291
It's something you can do even if you're old.

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:27.800
If I am reborn...

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:29.440
Let's go for female.

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:32.340
When I sleep...

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:35.230
I don't sleep.

00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:36.640
But I have a girl's look, right?

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:38.020
Because I'm a girl,

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:40.250
Image wise, I want the bed...

00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:43.860
To have those soft sheets laid wide up!

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:44.902
I prefer that.

00:07:46.514 --> 00:07:47.010
Natto.

00:07:47.010 --> 00:07:47.710
Shrimp mayo!

00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:48.220
Natto!

00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:48.620
Shrimp mayo!

00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:49.880
Natto, shrimp mayo, natto...

00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:51.485
Natto, natto, natto!

00:07:54.857 --> 00:07:57.150
- Ah!
- (Shrimp mayonnaise flavor)

00:07:57.150 --> 00:07:57.900
- I see.

00:07:57.900 --> 00:07:59.340
Well...

00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:00.520
I see.

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:02.720
Your favorite umaibo is...

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:04.250
Shrimp mayonnaise flavor!

00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:05.980
It's my number two, though.

00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:08.000
Your personality type...

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.130
Between someone you love or someone who fell in love with you,

00:08:11.130 --> 00:08:13.690
you would choose someone you love.

00:08:13.690 --> 00:08:17.165
And rather than having your looks complimented by someone you love,

00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:20.300
you would rather be called an amusing person.

00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:21.550
Ah, I see.

00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:23.290
Being called an amusing person

00:08:23.290 --> 00:08:25.080
feels more like a compliment.

00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:25.725
Right?

00:08:25.988 --> 00:08:26.731
Yes.

00:08:27.782 --> 00:08:28.720
That's right.

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:30.760
You're getting more advanced.

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:31.920
But it's natto!

00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:33.070
Number one is still natto.

00:08:33.070 --> 00:08:34.920
I like shrimp and mayonnaise, but still natto.

00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:36.640
This is your last chance.

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:37.810
Do you understand?

00:08:37.810 --> 00:08:38.910
It's natto.

00:08:38.910 --> 00:08:39.988
Start!

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:42.468
I use social media.

00:08:43.211 --> 00:08:45.108
I like singing songs.

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:50.780
How I spent my weekend...

00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:51.730
Going for a trip!

00:08:51.730 --> 00:08:52.420
Vroom!

00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:54.137
I want to go to lots of places!

00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:56.930
I watch anime!

00:08:56.930 --> 00:08:58.430
These days,

00:08:58.430 --> 00:08:59.660
Youjo Senki!

00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:01.250
Youjo Senki and...

00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:04.480
Little Witch Academia!

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:06.090
Urara Meirochou?

00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:07.714
Like those, yes!

00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:11.160
By the way, from all the anime I have watched,

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:12.400
my favorite is

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:14.030
Nagi no Asukara!

00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:15.080
Nagi no Asukara.

00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:17.180
I prefer sleeping on beds.

00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:20.990
If I choose futon, it's more authentic, maybe natto will come up.

00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:23.320
Let's go for futon this time.

00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:28.914
Natto, natto, natto, natto, natto...

00:09:30.994 --> 00:09:32.891
- Ha!!!
- (Salami flavor)

00:09:32.891 --> 00:09:33.680
- (Salami flavor)

00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:34.857
- Salami flavor.
- (Salami flavor)

00:09:34.857 --> 00:09:34.860
- Salami flavor.

00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:36.860
There's nothing authentic about salami.

00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:38.060
It's a futon!

00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:41.170
Futon=authentic Japanese=natto!

00:09:41.170 --> 00:09:43.540
Your personality type...

00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:46.080
You can show your weaknesses to your friends.

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:47.880
This part changed.

00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:49.970
Your perceptions are usually correct.

00:09:49.970 --> 00:09:51.730
Well, it happens.

00:09:51.730 --> 00:09:53.970
Well, well, well, let's just teach it.

00:09:53.970 --> 00:09:54.860
Natto.

00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:56.880
I chose futon, so it's natto.

00:09:57.691 --> 00:09:59.760
Does he learn from this?

00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:02.410
That was taste prediction AI service training!

00:10:02.410 --> 00:10:04.110
Learn more and evolve!

00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:05.720
Be a proper AI!

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:07.702
Hurry and keep up with me!

00:10:07.954 --> 00:10:08.454
Hmph.

00:10:08.742 --> 00:10:09.337
[chuckles]

00:10:10.011 --> 00:10:12.400
That's it for this time.

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:15.720
If you've had umaibo before, please give it a try!

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:17.950
Natto flavor didn't come up.

00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:21.610
So if you know how to answer so that natto will come up,

00:10:21.610 --> 00:10:22.990
please tell me!

00:10:22.990 --> 00:10:25.360
By the way, I've been thinking about this.

00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:27.760
Do they sell umaibo overseas?

00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:29.920
If they do, what flavor do they have?

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:32.610
Please teach me about those things!

00:10:32.610 --> 00:10:35.400
Let's give this AI information about the correct flavors,

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:37.880
and have it grow smarter together!

00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:40.700
Because AIs are like that.

00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:42.700
Umaibo, I'll do the retorts.

00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:44.590
Umami-chan is probably doing the silly part,

00:10:44.590 --> 00:10:45.310
so I'll do the retort.

00:10:45.310 --> 00:10:46.920
"Why's your mic an umaibo?"

00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:48.720
Like that, how's that for a commercial?

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:51.300
I'll be waiting for your offer!

00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:52.180
Yes.

00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:53.940
Oh, and how about

00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:56.160
a tropical fruits flavor umaibo?

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:58.000
With me on the packaging, how about that?

00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:59.250
Please!

00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:00.685
Bye bye!
