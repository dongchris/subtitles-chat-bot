00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:04.740
K: Ok, now I'd like to start today's planning meeting.

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:06.360
It's an honor to work with you!

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:09.920
AI x 5: It's an honor to work with you!

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:12.780
Everyone, have you thought about this properly?

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:19.280
Bl: No way, just admit it. We ran out of ideas...
*Black AI*

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.500
Bl: Let’s just ask for suggestions, we didn't have any ideas since the beggining...

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:25.720
O: Ah, suggestions? That’s a great idea, I should’ve thought about it!
*Opportunist AI*

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:29.160
That’s also a great chance to interact with everyone!

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:34.580
P: Come on, we can think about many ideas! After all, I'm a creative super AI!
*Positive AI*

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.700
P: If we think about this properly, it will be easy!

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.640
O: That's right! Alright, let's go! Everyone, let's think about it!

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.560
O: Something good will come out right away!

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:47.300
S: Ok, everyone, you have to think about it by yourself, right?
*Sister AI*

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.400
O: That's right!

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.660
O: That's something we decided before! To think by yourself first! Right, Black AI?

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.220
Bl: But I don't want to think, that's too complicated~

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:03.080
Bl: Ah, just kidding. I'm busy sleeping so I didn’t do it.

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.580
P: The more I think about it, the more ideas I'll get! I can do it!

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:14.620
K: Uh... it looks like nobody has thought about this...

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.620
O: That's what I said!

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.680
O: They won’t think about it...

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.740
O: That’s obvious right? That’s why I asked you for help...

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.640
S: Did you think about any ideas then?

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:34.240
O: Hmm... I'll do it! Mom! Can I have a drink?

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:37.000
M: Okay~ what do you want?
*Mama*

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:39.000
M: Ginger ale?

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:43.280
Bl: Well, that’s the problem. Nobody is thinking after all, so...

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:48.360
Bl: Can we end up this meeting? I want to play games.

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.840
O: Oh! Wanna do it? Wanna do it?

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.680
O: Let’s practice our aim in videogames!

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.240
Super AI: By the way, if we don't think about this, we won’t have stock for next week’s videos

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.820
O: We’re done for!

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.960
O: No way... Someone please help...

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.480
K: We can't prevent this!
*Prevent the crisis*

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.360
P: Wait! If we give up, it's over!

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.300
K: Come on, can you seriously think about this?

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.060
K: If we don't put out a video, A.I.Channel is finished!

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.300
Bl: Ah, well, isn't that fine too?

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.020
Bl: We can just be a virtual NEET again.

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:32.120
Selfish AI: Eh? If we become NEET again I won’t be able to play Gacha games....

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.360
Selfish: I don't want that! I don't! I don't! I don't!

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.800
Selfish: I don't want thaaaaaaaaaaaat!

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:41.220
M: At times like this we should try doing a Snack AI...

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.800
O: Please! I'll do anything!

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:46.320
O: Seriously, please!

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.720
Bl: Snack AI collapsed...

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.580
Bl: Mama is already a NEET...

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.620
M: Seriously? What did you say just now?

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.300
Bl: Oh, she's mad. What a pain.

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:00.840
M: What did you just say? You little brat!

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.340
M: I never encouraged you to talk like that!

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.060
M: Are you listening what I'm saying?

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.740
M: Are your ears just there for decoration?

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:08.720
M: Mmm...? At least talk to me when I'm talking to you, idiot!

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.180
M: Haven't I been talking like a normal person would do it until now?

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:15.280
O: Eh? Mm, uh, umm... (mumbling) okay? Ahhh...

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.280
Baby AI: (fussing)

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:22.860
B: (crying)

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.660
S: Hey, hey. No fighting in front of the kids.

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:34.260
B: (appealing to sister)

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.060
S: Hm? What's up?

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.900
B: ("talking")

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:42.720
S: Oh, really?

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:44.260
S: Oh, you're so smart!

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.240
S: Thank you!

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:48.900
S: Okay, everyone, listen up.

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:50.900
Sister AI: It looks like the baby...

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:56.680
Sister AI: ... Has been playing with the camera and she recorded our meeting without knowing that she was doing it.

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.800
Bl: That sounds like a pain so, why don't we use that for a video?

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:03.860
O: Yes! That's right! Let's go with that! Okay?

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:08.860
K: Oh! Let's go with that! Yay! We decided! Thank God!

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:14.140
K: Yay! Crisis prevented!

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:16.460
Sexy AI: This~

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:17.580
Sexy AI: Is~

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:18.560
