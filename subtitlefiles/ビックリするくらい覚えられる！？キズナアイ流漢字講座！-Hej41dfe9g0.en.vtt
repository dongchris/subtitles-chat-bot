00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:01.760
Everybody, good day.

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:03.680
It is Virtual Kanji Lecture time.

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:05.640
Does everyone use kanji

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:06.960
regularly?

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:09.340
It is something very profound.

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:10.720
It is deeply intriguing!

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:13.660
There are origins for every kanji

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.120
For example, this:

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.260
The kanji read "Ki".

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.080
In English, it would be "tree".

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:19.680
This kanji

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.500
is said to have had its shape derived from something that exists,

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.520
and reached what you see now.

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:26.020
Now that you say it,

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.120
it really isn't something you cannot see.

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:29.000
However!

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:34.100
It is not as if every kanji had its shape derived from something that exists

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:35.340
With that,

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.140
I, the super A.I., was struck with an epiphany!

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.940
If we draw out kanji,

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.260
which can't be drawn, anyway,

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:43.380
would that not make it easier to remember?

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:44.480
IYAAAAAA !

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:45.260
This time you see

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.680
I'm going to show you

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:48.820
the intelligent super A.I. part of me!

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.600
A lot of it!

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.080
Of course for everyone who doesn't know kanji,

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.460
and those who are notoriously forgetful,

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:56.620
this is a must-watch!

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.660
I'll draw the kanji and make it easily remembered

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:01.760
I'll make it something unforgettable  for you...

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.120
Anyway, let's do this!

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:04.340
First is this!

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.920
“Hito”!

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.100
The English word is “Human”.

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.400
I want to know more about humans.

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.520
It is a must to remember this kanji.

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.220
I want to try illustrating this

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:15.920
in my own way

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:17.580
First off...

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.480
Unlike "Mr.Kinpachi(TV drama series)" , one person and another person

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.100
don't support each other.

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:26.380
Because there is a person who is supporting

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.080
and therefore a person getting supported

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:29.980
Like this.

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.800
Well...

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.680
The result is still two supporting each other

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:35.380
But in the real world,

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.460
there are people working hard at the bottom supporting

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.100
and people who work hard while being supported.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:44.680
Well but in the end, this guy’s work will come back and like a “win-win” like that

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.320
Something like that.

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.720
JA JAN! This is Kizuna Ai Style!

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.220
How to memorize the kanji for "Human"

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.440
There is someone supporting, and there is someone being supported

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:56.700
That’s right, a NEET was the one to figured that out.

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:57.720
By the way,

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.100
Well, umm...

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.380
And so, it was supposed to look like this!

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.520
It doesn't matter which one you remember, as long as you can remember one!

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.240
Ok, next!

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:09.420
働く - work

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:11.920
In English, this is "work"

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.820
I've been a Virtual NEET twice.

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.840
In order to not become a NEET, let's memorise.

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.440
Ok, let's go!

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.980
First, like before,

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:23.240
there's a person,

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.180
with a heavy thing.

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.660
Heavy, like this. A rock.

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.600
Like this.

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.040
There's also a roller.

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.420
To make it easier to carry.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
And pushing it with power.

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.480
The power of division of labour.

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.540
And, push!

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:45.900
This person is pulling. Like a dog.

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.880
The pulling person and the pushing power,

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.540
The pushing power

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:51.840
And the heavy object.

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:52.720
Tada!

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.460
This is Kizuna Ai style!

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:55.660
働く！

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.340
That's how to remember it!

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:01.480
It's like from the old days, when people didn't have the conveniences that we have now.

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:07.540
That's how they did it, by pushing and pulling with their own strength.

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:09.740
And so most jobs were like this.

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:11.600
And so, that's why this character is like this.

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.800
It became the character for "to work".

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.340
What do you think?

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:16.540
Ding ding ding!

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.720
These are the same result, but

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.180
That's the origin.

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.600
This kanji is composed of two other kanji.

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.000
This one is 人 (hito, people),

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.040
And this is 動(ugoku , to move - requires く to form a verb).

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.740
And so they mean "to work".

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:34.020
Next is the animal series!

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:37.580
Let's look at kanji originally modeled on animals!

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:38.440
This!

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:39.520
“Uma”!

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:41.880
In English, this is "horse".

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.140
*virtually neighs*

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.100
Now let's draw!

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.560
First, well the dash are the feet.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
The dashes are the feet, so

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:53.540
And a horse's face looks something like this...

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.900
So the feet are here.

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:02.240
And this is the mane.

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.060
This looks like a dinosaur!

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:07.920
Well if I said it's a horse you'd know.

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:11.860
The four dashes are the feet.

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:15.460
And this here is the mane.

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:17.160
Horse.

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.160
And this here is the tail.

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:22.380
Tada!

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:23.980
This is the Kizuna Ai Style!

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.680
The way to memorise "horse"!

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:27.680
What do you think?

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.680
I think this is pretty good. Easy to remember.

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:32.840
By the way,

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.380
This is how it evolved.

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:37.380
And that's how you write “Uma”!

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:39.300
Ok, next!

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:41.380
Next is also part of the animal series!

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:43.120
From here on they'll be a little difficult.

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:43.880
Whale!

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:44.720
“Shachi”!

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.540
In English, this is called "Killer Whale"

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:50.980
This doesn't have an animal it is originally modeled off,

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:54.540
So I, Kizuna Ai will think of one!

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:55.600
Let's go!

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:59.160
Fish.... fish...

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:00.120
There's a fish here...

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:01.420
here's a fish

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:03.320
next to the fish

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:04.920
belongs a tiger

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:06.500
it's belly is fat and soft

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:07.820
like a raccoon dog right

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:10.800
even though I said tiger

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:12.100
you can't see it

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:13.300
It's a tiger!

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:14.300
it's a tiger alright

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:15.760
a fish

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:16.740
and a tiger

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:17.580
*sick SFX*

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:18.980
This is the Kizuna Ai way to write it

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:20.400
"Killer whale"

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:21.540
can be remembered like this

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:22.900
Well if I must say so myself

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:23.900
Isn't this a work of art?

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:24.820
but first, look at this

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:27.420
if you  remember

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:29.200
the fish kanji and tiger kanji

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:31.280
and put them together, a killer whale pops out...I guess

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:33.020
probably not the actual killer whale kanji

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.140
surely, we can accept that

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:36.980
but this is more like, ya know,

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:38.740
that one thingy

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:40.460
to end up with the killer whale kanji

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:41.540
this is more like

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:43.660
a way for everybody to remember the kanji

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:45.240
in a daily life situation

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.360
and I think that's important

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:48.580
so yeah

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:49.880
by the way

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:51.160
the origin of this kanji

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:52.460
is the head of tiger

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:54.060
but the body of a fish

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:56.220
and it seems like

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:57.180
there are parts from various animals

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:58.320
I see

00:05:58.320 --> 00:05:59.640
When you hear the word ”killer whale”

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:01.240
It’s there at the Nagoya Castle

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:02.420
Shachihoko!

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:03.320
It’s famous.

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:04.560
there are killer whales there too

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:06.380
the last one is....

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:07.660
“Suki”!

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:08.920
Like! Like!

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:10.920
Even though I already said it in English

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:12.820
it's "like" right?

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:16.560
I love everybody who always watches my videos!

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:18.840
and everybody likes........

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:20.840
me right......?

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:21.520
Right!

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:22.920
If you can remember this kanji

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.220
and leave it as a comment and I'll be happy!

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:25.920
I guess

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:28.100
Huh what..nobody said anything

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:30.720
Sometimes....the voice of the heart leaks, can't do anything about that

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:31.400
Now,

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:32.640
about this kanji

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:34.460
to make everybody able to remember this kani

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:36.080
I'll draw an illustration again!

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:37.000
leggo!

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:38.300
First

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:40.000
I’ll draw a girl!

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:41.660
the “girl” radical's part is

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:42.780
probably me right

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:44.520
Ai am

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:46.220
like this now

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:49.240
Because my friend is

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:51.220
a child (子 ko=child)

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:53.160
Pyon pyon pyon!

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:54.240
like this I think

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:55.280
Oh! I understand now!

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:56.440
The “child” radical is

00:06:57.460 --> 00:06:58.500
an arrow…

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:00.000
cupid's arrow!

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:03.520
If I told you, you’d see it

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:04.440
Look!

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:06.380
It looks similar! JA JAN!

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:08.140
This is Kizuna Ai Style!

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.460
The style I love to remember things with!

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:11.680
If you ask me about this..

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:15.980
First if you are talking about a female....well it has no gender

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.820
Well, that was me, wasn't it?

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:19.820
Rell, because I like it,

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:21.800
So I drew a Cupid's arrow...

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:23.960
And I see some child! Right!

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:27.660
I will shoot all of your hearts with my arrow! Make you fall for me!

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:30.180
That kind of impression...How was it!

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:31.700
Can you remember it!?

00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:33.060
If you can remember it!

00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:34.760
Right? Please draw it!

00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:38.420
However the true meaning was meant to be "female"

00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:42.620
"A mother is hugging her kid" kind of meaning

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:44.020
That's heart-warming

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:47.280
That is heart-warming~kind of impression

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:50.580
The original meaning of the Kanji was great..was great but

00:07:50.685 --> 00:07:53.695
Ai-Style was great too, right? even if you try to remember in either way

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:56.900
It's okay if you can remember it properly, just choose the way you like

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.120
and remember it the way you want!

00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:00.900
So how was it? Kizuna Ai's Kanji teaching session

00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:02.440
How should I describe this? but it's been a long time

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:05.640
I think I explained things thoroughly like a proper AI

00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:08.920
How was it? Did I improve? Am I smarter now?

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:10.780
I'm not a bonkler after all...Wait..

00:08:10.805 --> 00:08:13.845
but before farewell, with the chance of introducing Kanji,

00:08:13.845 --> 00:08:15.740
Let me tell you guys something cool!

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:18.100
If you write my name in Kanji

00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:19.040
It is written like this! 絆(Kizuna) 愛(Ai)

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:21.760
If you curious about the meaning of my name, make sure to research and check for yourself!

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:23.835
That's my coursework for you guys!

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:25.900
Hand this in next week!

00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:26.765
With that said!

00:08:26.765 --> 00:08:28.960
Let's revise together next time!

00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:32.860
so then, this was the super Intelligent AI, Kizuna Ai~

00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:34.140
See you later!

00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:39.960
More at the end! Don't end the video here!

00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:47.600

00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:52.620
Everyone..Did you all remember the last Kanji?

00:08:52.625 --> 00:08:54.635
Can you write it down in the comment section?
