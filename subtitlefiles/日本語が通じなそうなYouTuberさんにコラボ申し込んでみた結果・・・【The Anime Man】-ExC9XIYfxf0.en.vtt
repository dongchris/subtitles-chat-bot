00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.760
Hello everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai here!

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.600
It turns out that soon, it’ll be a year since I started uploading videos on YouTube!

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.300
I managed to reach more than 900,000 subscribers...

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:10.280
...And people all over the world are watching me

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.480
There’s various reasons for why my videos in which I only speak Japanese...

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:15.900
...Have extended all over the world, but...

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.720
...One of the reasons is that YouTubers around the world have been showing me to you guys!

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.120
It turns out that today, one of those YouTubers came here as a guest

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:27.300
I’m still learning English, but...

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.100
...I’ll work hard to talk with him and make it so that this collab works out

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.700
In that case, let's call him immediately!

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.240
It's about "The Anime Man"-san!

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.940

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.220

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.840

00:01:26.665 --> 00:01:27.560

AI: Her chest? Her face?

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.340

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:29.860
AM: I wonder what it is...

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:31.900

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.380
AI: Ah, well... how do I say it?

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.320

AI: Ah, I see! She's in another country?

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.880
AM: That’s right, she lives abroad, so then...
AI: AAAAHHHHH!

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:42.840
AM: ...It’s because of that, that we don’t see each other so often

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.180
AI: I see!
AM: It's because if that, that every time we do see each other, well...

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.100
AM: ...I have the urge to do it and...

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:49.380
AM: ...It’s because of that, that I kissed her then

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:50.240

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:06.200
AI: So then, well, talking with human beings regarding having a girlfriend, a boyfriend, or someone that you like, well...

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:08.120
AI: ...It feels very refreshing talking about that...

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:09.980
AI: I always feel that someday, I’d like to ask that question

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:11.360

AI: You don’t just talk about your favorite anime...

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:32.860

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:56.040
AI: Ooohhhh!

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:58.720
AI: Well, isn’t Sailor Moon great?

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:01.740
AM: It's great!
AI: That’s right! I also...! Well...

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:03.780
AI: From the original series up to Stars...

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:06.180
AI: ...I already... watched it completely

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:07.800
AM: Aaahh! Really?

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:09.200
AI: Of course, which of them do you like?

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:12.620
AM: Well, yes, I’d say Mercury

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:14.180
AI: Ah! Mercury-chan!

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:15.500
AM: Mercury-chan is adorable, right?
AI: Mercury-chan...

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:17.580
AI: ...She’s very popular with the guys, right?

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:18.860
AM: It's true

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:20.860
AM: I wonder… I wonder why is that
AI: Why is that?

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:22.020
AM: Is it because of the blue color? (Without thinking)

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:24.940
AI: My favorites are...

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:27.220
AI: ...Chibiusa-chan and Sailor Moon
AM: Yes

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:30.040
AM: Ah, but Chibiusa is adorable, right?
AI: Chibusa is adorable

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:31.620
AM: It's true
AI: She’s adorable

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:34.440
AM: And on the contrary, do you tend to read Shounen manga?

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:35.600
AI: Ah, I read them!

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:36.700
AM: Eh? In that case, which do you read?

00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:37.880
AI: Eh, well, that of Shounen Jump...?

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:39.360
AI: For example, Shokugeki no Souma...

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:39.880
AM: Oh, oh

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:41.200
AI: Tokyo Ghoul, right?

00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:41.880
AM: Yes, yes, yes

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:43.780
AI: I’ve seen so many that I don't remember them, wait...

00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:47.020
AM: But you tend to read the Shounen Jump magazine?

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:48.480
AI: Probably, well...

00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:51.280
AI: ...I haven’t read the Shounen Jump manga, but...

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:55.000
AI: ...Probably, within the compilation volumes I tend to read, Shounen Jump appears there

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.320
AM: Ooohhh... I see, I see...

00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:59.820
AM: In my case, well, of course...

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:03.040
AM: If I had to choose, I’d prefer the old Jump

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:03.840
AI: Ah! I see

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:06.240
AM: Of course, I like the new Jump, but...
AI: So then you like the old Jump?

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:07.060
AM: Yu Yu Hakusho!

00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:08.060
AI: Aaaahhh!

00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:08.760
AM: For example

00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:09.940
AM: ...Or Slam Dunk

00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:11.660
AI: Ah, I see, I see!
AM: I belong to that generation

00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:14.200
AI: Ah!
AM: I've grown up during that generation, so then...

00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:15.940
AM: Eh? How old are you?

00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:17.400
AI: Well, I’m 23 years old

00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:19.120

00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:20.840
AM: Eh? How old are you, Ai-chan?

00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:21.920
AI: I’m one year old!

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:23.960
AM: Ah, a year! Eh? Then I’m much more older than you!

00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:25.780
AI: I see, but...

00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:27.660
AI: ...Definitely since you’ve lived abroad...
AM: Yes

00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:32.620
AI: ...Well, the old manga were being translated and sold there, right?

00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:33.820
AM: Aaah, no, but...

00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:35.360
AM: ...In my case of manga, well...

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:37.220
AM: ...I came twice to Japan...

00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:40.280
AM: ...And well, I bought a lot of manga… in large amounts
AI: Eehh?

00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:41.120
AI: Incredible! Eh?

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:43.040
AI: Can you read kanji?

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:47.500
AM: Ah, well, I learned Japanese by basically reading manga

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:49.680
AI: Eh? It's really possible to do that?

00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:51.420
AM: So that, I practically learned it on my own

00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:52.040
AI: Eeeehh?

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:58.160
AM: Well, of course, when I was in middle school, I read Slam Dunk, Dragon Ball and Yu Yu Hakusho

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:00.380
AM: And aside from the compilation volumes...

00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:02.320
AM: ...Well, I had a dictionary of Japanese characters

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:03.700
AI: Ah, that's amazing!

00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:06.980
AM: And then, when I saw a kanji without furigana and I wondered what its meaning was...

00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:09.680
AM: … I brought it with me and I’d look for it in the dictionary and understood its meaning

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:13.160
AI: I see, Eeeehh?
AM: That way I was learning until reaching to this point

00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:18.520
AI: Eh? In fact in the world of manga, there appears peculiar letters

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:19.020
AM: Yes, yes

00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:23.280
AI: Those kind of words... for example, words that don’t show up on the dictionary

00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:25.240
AM: Ah, it's true
AI: What did you do on those cases?

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:28.560
AM: Well, in that case, I had no other option than to interpret the meaning myself

00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:29.280
AI: I see!

00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:31.820
AM: For example, at first, the word "Tsundere"
AI: Aaaahhh!

00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:32.660
AI: It's true! It's true!

00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:33.880
AM: I didn't understand its meaning at all!

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:34.620
AI: Hmm... hmm... hmm...

00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:35.980
AM: And I asked my mother and she also didn't understand, so then...

00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:36.680
AI: It was to be expected

00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:38.840
AM: And then after seeing so much anime and manga...

00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:41.060
AM: "Ah! It definitely has this meaning"

00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:42.840
AM: And well, the explanation arose spontaneously

00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:43.780
AI: Eeeehhh?

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:44.860
AI: Incredible

00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:50.760
AI: Eh? In that case, if I want to learn English there exists manga from other places, right?

00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:51.440
AM: Ah, there is!

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:55.960
AI: Ah! I see, in that case, it’s probably a good idea to read foreign manga

00:09:56.060 --> 00:09:59.300
AM: Ah, it's true, close to my house, there exists a Kinokuniya store (Chain of libraries from Japan)

00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:00.000
AI: Eeeehh?

00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:04.540
AM: That’s right, even in Australia... it already expanded a lot, but even in Australia, there’s Kinokuniya stores

00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:06.260
AI: Eeh? Is it written in kanji?

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:07.020
AM: It's written in kanji

00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:08.080
AI: Eeeh? Incredible!

00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:11.220
AM: And inside the store, of course, you can find magazines and manga...

00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:15.000
AM: Well, it sells Japanese magazines and manga completely translated to English
AI: Eeeehhh?

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.500
AI: Ah, in that case, just a bit ago, I appeared in the Comptiq magazine

00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:21.040
AI: Is it possible it sells that magazine too?

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:22.680
AM: Ah! It probably sells it

00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:23.880
AI: Eh? Buy one and bring it to me please!

00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:26.500
AM: Ah, good, I’ll buy it... in that case, you want the donuts and the Comptiq magazine in English, right?

00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:27.500
AI: That’s right! That’s right! The English version!

00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:28.200
AM: Understood!

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:28.820
AI: Goood!

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:29.920
AI: Man...

00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:31.240

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:34.280

00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:46.460
AI: ...To transmit my feelings of gratitude for presenting me with everyone around the world

00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:50.500

00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:52.840

00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:01.800
AM: Time, well...
AI: You have time, there's nothing you need to do right?

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:03.760
AM: Well, yes, I have time
AI: Well...

00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:07.200
AI: If Anime Man-san asks me please
AM: Eh?

AI: Well, to me, it doesn't matter, but...

00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:12.900
AI: ...I’ll accept doing another video with you

00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:14.460
AM: You’re not good at trying to be a Tsundere

00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:16.160
AI: Shut up!

00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:17.620
