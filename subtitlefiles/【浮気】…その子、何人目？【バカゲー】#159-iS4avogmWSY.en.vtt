00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:02.680
Hello everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai here!

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:03.880
For today...

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:05.620
I'll be playing this game I played twice now...

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:07.380
Eh? What was it?

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:11.280
I’ll be playing the app called “Furare Kaihi”!
(Break-Up Dodge)

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.740
I’ve been playing it for three days so I should be fine… *laughs*

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.780
I’ll show you how I win over the heart of an annoying woman!

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:20.240
With that being said, let's go!

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.220
I left it at the 4th stage

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.510
I did unlock the secret stage, but…

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.680
I never finished it… I’d like to beat it first...
*4th stage: Anniversary*

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.140
"Anniversary"!

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:30.900
♪ The pasta that you prepared is delicious ♪
“BF: No one's looking, feed me ❤, Aaaaaah ❤”

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.260
♪ The pasta that you prepared is delicious ♪
“GF: Oh you~❤ After one year you haven't changed a bit, have you?”

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:33.440
She’s so annoying...
“BF: Hnn?! The fresh pasta you're feeding me is delicious~❤”

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:34.300
“GF: Yeah, yeah ❤ Of course, BF-kun…”

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.320
Stop flirting with each other...

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:36.200
“GF: Today’s our anniversary right....? ❤”

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:37.660
It's their anniversary today, isn't it?

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.050
What anniversary? I have no idea…
“BF: …...”

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:41.760
He doesn’t know what anniversary…
“GF: BF, are you listening to me?”

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.220
Umm...

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:49.780
"GF: What day is it today?"

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.160
“BF: I was thinking about asking you too!”

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.000
“GF: So you remembered?”

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:03.320
”Stay quiet and hug her”

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:04.380
*swish*

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.600
Eh?

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.560
"GF: That's an afterimage" *laughs*

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:10.280
*inhales*

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.180
THAT'S SO WEIRD!

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:15.060
“It's an afterimage”

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.600
”GF: Hugging and acting suspicious is the worst"

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:21.100
That's not true!

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.700
*inhales*

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.880
That was... correct!

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:26.900
"Stay quiet and take her hand"

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:27.600
How about that?

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:28.340
*GF: ...Oh, BF!*

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:29.380
"GF: ...Oh, BF!"

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:30.500
"Kiss her hand"

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:31.600
“GF: Kya...!”

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.440
“BF: It turned out to be... the anniversary of the first hand kiss?”

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:34.640
“GF: You~... Made my heart pound so much it might get worn out!”

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:35.540
Ah!
“GF: You~... Made my heart pound so much it might get worn out!”

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.220
Ah! That was a piece of cake, ta!
*Excuse Clear*

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:40.920
Weeeell, you know how it is!

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.600
I came to understand her, right?

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.460
"Intercom", that sounds bad...

It’s still ringing!

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:41.320
I see...

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.240
Ah, behind him, there's something blue

"GF: Is it okay to not get that?"

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:46.420

"GF: He seems pretty insistent, though..."

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:52.240
"GF: Even so, what if we answer him?"

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:55.900
*Salesmen are a pro at persuasion. The time I answered one, I got caught up in his pace...*

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.500
*And he made me pick some strange merchandise and gave me a contract, you know*

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:58.340
*It’s safer to pretend we’re not home*

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.060
"Salesmen are a pro at persuasion"

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:04.280
"It’s safer to pretend we’re not home", let's pick... this one

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:08.180
He did that pretty cool, right?

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:11.340
“GF: In that case, I'll answer him"

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.520
Why are you answering him?!

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:14.020
*inhales*

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:17.640
When you're over at someone's house, don't just go ahead and answer the intercom!

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:19.740
*ding-dong*

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:20.940
"GF: Is it okay to not get that?"

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.600
"BF: It'd indeed be probably better to answer it!"

Oh!

“GF2: Eh…”

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:47.240
"GF2: Hey! Why are you not letting me into your room?! The response was late as well..."

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.780
If I said "my stomach hurts", would she look after me?

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:53.240
Both are bad, aren't they?

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:56.500
Our room’s a mess, and I was just about to say I’d clean it up...

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:58.700
"BF: Because my stomach hurts..."

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:03.580
“GF2: Oh, that's what happened. Are you okay now?"

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:06.840
“BF: No, I'm not"

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:08.900
“GF2: Eh?"

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:12.180
“BF: Sorry, that's the case, can you go home for today?"
"GF2: Ah, okay"

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:13.360
YEEEES!
*Excuse Clear*

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.400
Yes! I did it!

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.000
Just as expected!

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:19.980

You're too close to each other!

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.260
"BF: Can I make it rain kisses?", what do you mean raining kisses?!

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:32.500
That's disgusting!

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:34.020
“BF: It's only the two of us though?"

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:34.920
“Ding-dong!"

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:35.420
Ah...

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:38.980
Is this the girlfriend's house?
“GF: Sorry, my friend is coming today"

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:42.320
This is the girlfriend's house...
“???: I'm coming in"

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:48.940
“BF: Hello, nice to meet you"

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:52.160
“BF: It's good weather today... maybe thanks to you"

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:56.980
“GF: Hey, isn't my friend…?"

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:58.320
*ding*

00:04:58.940 --> 00:04:59.440
Fight!

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:01.380
“GF: She's cute, right?"

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
“BF: She's cuter than average"

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:05.900
"She's not really my type", kind of thing?

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:09.720
“GF: I wanted to ask your opinion... She's cute, right?”

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:11.640
She repeated the question...

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:13.100
I'll say it again?

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:15.400
“BF: She's cuter than average"

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:17.180
Ah, of course

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:19.380
“BF: She's cute"

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:21.540
If I say, "not really", then I'm in trouble...

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:24.720
I mean if this girlfriend brings a friend over, she'll ask:

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.220
"Hey look! Isn't she cute?"

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:30.980
Even if you say "She's cute!" when it's an annoying girl...

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:34.280
"Oh, okay..." is what they'll say!

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:36.660
If you say, "Not really"...

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:40.140
Then she'll say "Don't say that to my friend"! It's impossible

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:42.480
“GF: Hmm..."

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:45.340
“BF: Sorry, sorry... I wanted you to get jealous"

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:47.580
“GF: You, you idiot!"

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:49.200
“BF: You're even more cute"

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:53.060
“GF's friend: Ah... I'm causing trouble so I'll come another day ♪"

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:54.360
Oh?

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:56.060
Oh!

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:56.940
*Excuse Draw*

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:57.500
Eh?

00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:59.080

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:00.400
*inhales*

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:01.480
What do you mean, "draw"...?

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:05.120
"GF: She's cute right?"
"BF: Not really"

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:07.160
"GF: What? You're horrible"

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:08.680
See?! This is what happens!

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:11.320
"BF: Because you're the only one for me"

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:14.460
"GF: You're staring at her..."

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:14.960
*inhales*

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:18.300

"GFF: Thank you very much ♪"
*GF: I know, right? These bangs are in right now*

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:31.700
Ah! Ah!

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:33.260
Oh?

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:35.100
Eh?

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:37.440
"BF: Wait..."

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.900
Hey! But she really is...
"BF: She's super cute!"

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:42.240
"BF: I have to get her number now!"

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:43.740
Get her number... ah!
"BF: I have to get her number now!"

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:46.280
Fight! It started...
"BF: Um, so..."

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:47.360
*GFF: Oh, go on~?*

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:49.820
Girls like this...

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:53.700
They always get along at first but they'll definitely tell your girlfriend later...

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:56.560
"Do you have LIME?" is a little bit too direct, so...
(LINE is a SNS App used heavily in Japan. LIME is just renamed for copyright reasons)

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:59.360
"BF: Do you hang out with GF a lot?"

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:01.040
*GFF: We sometimes go out for lunch on the way home from school ❤*

"BF: You must be good friends. Want to be my friend too?"

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:09.520
GF's, right? GF's good friend...

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:10.470

"BF: It's fine, it's fine!"

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:12.250
"GFF: It’s NOT fine ❤"

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:14.270

You look cute... I mean, in those clothes!

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:24.450
"GFF: I've just bought new spring clothes~❤"

00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:26.560
"GFF: These are my favourite brand, and..."

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:32.980
"BF: Aw, I want to go and buy some with you too!"

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:35.610
"GFF: But these are ladies' clothes?"

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:40.240
Ah, this one! This one, this one, this one!

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:43.080
"I want to give a surprise present to GF!"

00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:44.480
Isn't it perfect?
“BF: Do you want to help me pick it out?”

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:45.840
“GFF: Wow, that would be wonderful. Sure~❤”

00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:46.580
Oh!
“BF: Let’s get on LIME”

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:47.520
“GFF: Alright ❤”

00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:49.720
There it is! Yes!
“Excuse Clear”

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:51.460
Well, that's how it goes...

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:53.540
This must be his third or fourth girlfriend

00:07:53.550 --> 00:07:56.380
How could let trash like him get with you…?

00:07:56.380 --> 00:07:57.920
You've all got no taste in guys!

00:07:57.920 --> 00:07:59.720
Also, I guess...

00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:00.690
It could happen

00:08:00.690 --> 00:08:02.920
I'd probably do it too if someone told me...

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:04.640
Something like, "You’re so cute, oh not at all"

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:06.410
*lovey-dovey gibberish*

00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:07.140
Where does it end?!

00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:07.940
That kind of thing...

00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:08.920
...Kind of thing

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:10.160
Ah, but for the most part...

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:11.950
I've got the hang of this, haven't I?

00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:12.960
I'm perfect, aren't I?

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:14.800
With this power, I will...

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:15.940
Take over the world

00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:17.800
Human girls...

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:18.680
Just you wait!

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:21.350
Well then, this was Virtual Youtuber, Kizuna Ai!

00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:22.360
See you next time!
