00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:13.260
- I'm pretty sure I left you at the bar...

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:15.740
- Oh yep! That's right...
- And then I didn't see you for the rest of the night!

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:17.700
- Dude, I feel like we barely made it outta there alive...

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.140
- You were those guys...

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:20.720
- Well dude, he wouldn't let us go!

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.620
He just kept us all there! I think he, like, bought out the entire bar!

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:26.740
- Seriously?
- But he tipped the bartender, like, 20 bucks so...

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:28.840
(Both laugh)

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.960
- Some things never change...
- Seriously...

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.820
- But wasn't it great to see everyone again? Like, that's why I love weddings. They're like mini reunions.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.460
- I think the last time we were all together was that big trip to Costa Rica

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.400
- Oh my gosh! You're right! That was seven years ago... SEVEN YEARS.

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.460
Man I don't know why I lost touch with most of them.

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:51.760
- Well, I think life just takes people in different directions.

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:52.620
- Yeah.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:53.600
But...

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:55.060
You and I stayed friends.

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:57.680
- Yeah...

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.200
- Ahh... this is a good one of all of us

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.840
Whoa! What is going on here? Brandon is ALL over you!

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.480
- Yeah...
- What...

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.420
- He definitely took advantage of the open bar.

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.600
Got super drunk... and weird.

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.600
- Weird? How so?

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.120
- Ugh... Well...

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:26.420
Just before we left, he pulled me to the side and he told me he liked me...?

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.840
- And I'm guessing that's not what you wanted to hear.

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.240
- I mean... I'm flattered?
- (Laughs)

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.060
- He's sweet...
- Right...

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.020
- But... it's a bit more complicated than that...

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.520
- (Laughs cynically)

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.420
Yeah... Especially at our age right? And everything we've been through?

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.540
You can't just tell someone I like you.

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.060
(Both chuckle knowingly)

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.120
- Remember when 'I like you' was enough?

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.020
- 'I like you' was all you wanted to hear from someone.

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:06.840
- I do.

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:14.340
- I mean, I can clearly recall the first time I heard those words from the girl that I liked.

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:20.100
- For the first time it was mutual. And of all the people in our town, she chose me.

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.480
- It was the most incredible feeling in the world. 'I like you' was enough.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:26.960
- When was this?

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.160
- Last week.
(Both laugh)
Just kidding!

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.180
- No, it was high school. She became my first girlfriend.

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:37.640
- She became my first love.

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:39.720
- (Coos adoringly)

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.820
'I like you' became 'I love you'.

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:46.040
- (Chuckles) Yeah...

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.840
- (Takes a deep breath and sighs)

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.540
- Remember when...
- ...'I love you' was enough?

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:59.100
- Yeah...

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.060
- 'I love you' was the epitome of your feelings for someone

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.280
It meant you two were no longer kids.

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:12.620
That you found... 'The One'.

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.240
You were done.

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:16.560
(Chuckles)
That's it.

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:19.480
- It was...

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:20.100
- ...enough.

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:23.140
- Yeah.

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.120
- But that was before ex-boyfriends

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.040
- Before ex-girlfriends.

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:37.500
- Before...

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:39.640
Her disapproving parents.

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:45.860
Before that little bad habits grew into the most annoying thing ever.

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:48.960
Before pretending to like golf.

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.300
Before wishing he'd enjoy dancing

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:55.760
...and sitting through musicals just to make her happy.

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:00.860
It was enough before she took the job overseas.

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:03.640
And long distance revealed our weaknesses.

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.520
This was before he gave up...

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.980
...on himself.

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:13.380
Before you realised you were never going to convert.

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.220
This was before he was ready for marriage and kids...

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:18.720
...And you weren't.

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:24.400
'I love you' was enough before other 'I love you's.

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:30.720
And before he said... 'I thought I loved you'.

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:35.680
This was before he cheated.

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:40.520
And before your own thoughts strayed to someone else.

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.700
It was enough before we were hurt so deeply...

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:49.780
And before we hurt others so selfishly.

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:54.840
'I love you' was enough...

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:57.100
...until you found out...

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:58.900
...it wasn't.

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:03.740
(Sighs deeply)

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:10.580
- Hey!

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:12.320
Where are you going? What's up?

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:15.420
- (Scoffs)

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:17.000
- Is that what you really believe?

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:23.340
- I'm just saying love isn't as simple as we once thought it was... I mean that's true, right?

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:24.520
- (Scoffs again)

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:27.160
You know always kept a little hope with you...

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:29.680
...but you're so far gone.

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:31.420
(Sighs sadly)

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:34.020
Probably doesn't even matter if I tell you.

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:38.720
- What're you talking about?

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:42.140
- (Laughs and sighs)

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:46.500
- You wanna know why I told Brandon things were so complicated?

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:04.240
- I like you.

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:08.620
I might even love you.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.200
But you're right.

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:14.860
It's just words.

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:16.280
A statement.

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:22.880
It's not enough and it won't ever be if you think that's all you'll need.

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:27.660
What makes it enough...

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:30.600
What makes it 'The One'...

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:33.200
...is Choice.

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:37.600
Constantly choosing to love.

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:48.240
So what're you going to choose?

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.260
- ...
