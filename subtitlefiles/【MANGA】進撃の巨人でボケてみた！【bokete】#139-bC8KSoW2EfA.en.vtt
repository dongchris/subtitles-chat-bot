00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.760
Hello everyone! Virtual Youtuber Kizuna Ai here!

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.080
Do you guys know about "bokete"?

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:05.960
Yep! Bokete!

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:07.620
Ah, so you haven't, I see

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:08.460
Nope, it's not really like that

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.580
There is an application called bokete

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:12.100
Did you know about it? You do, right?

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:12.600
Alright!

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.760
With that said, we'll be making joke retorts (bokete) today!

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:18.580
Using it, we'll test my sense of humor..

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:22.700
The main topic today involves a collaboration between Attack on Titan and bokete..

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:24.180
And I'll be doing exactly that

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.160
How do I describe this?

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:26.880
Since it's a collaboration, it's a little like this...

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.280
There are many things we can make a joking retort to..

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:33.380
So, we'll choose a few of them...

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:34.720
And make it into a calendar!

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:39.440
I'll use the retorts I make within a calendar!

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:40.680
I know you want it, right?

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.740
Well, even though I can't have one myself...

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:43.760
But, but, but...

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.280
I'll be happy as long as my jokes reach everyone of you!

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.120
I hope you keep using them too, alright?

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:51.600
So without further ado, let's get right into it!

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.520
Oooh, it seems like we have a lot here...

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.340
This is surprisingly harder than I thought..

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:56.920
Ah, I thought of one!

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.920
He's not wearing it, is he?

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.760
I can retort to this one...

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:01.620
I'm done

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:02.720
I think I'm going to leak...

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.160
It's just perfect, isn't it?

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.360
Well, we can definitely use this

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.580
By the way, what do other people write about this one?

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.860
W-why am I the only one to pull it tight like that? I'm the colossal titan, you know?

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:14.380
Ah, I get it now

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.140
The joke got laid over

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.140
So that's it. I wonder what I should do...

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:19.760
Ah, I thought of one!

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.020
"Just shut up already! Go ahead and put all your bets on me!"

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:24.380
So he said something cool..

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.280
And after that, he died a sudden death from playing pachinko..

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.340
This is an awesome one! So here it is!

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:29.820
It was a great life...

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:30.860
Suspected to be married!

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.700
I'm not getting married, so don't worry, alright?

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.060
Ah, that's just perfect

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.280
Ah, I thought of something else again..

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:38.680
Alright, I got it!

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.040
Quick, let's go back

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.080
Time elapsed since entry to amusement park: 1 minute

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.800
What a demon!

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.320
Alright, I thought of one!

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:45.420
So it's you again...

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.020
He's actually embarrassed but he's trying to hide it, lolololol!

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.680
That's just perfect, right?

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.080
Well, well, which should I use next? Isn't this worth looking forward to?

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.460
Virtual Youtuber Kizuna Ai?

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:56.240
Not bad at all...

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:57.540
Alright, that's done!

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.740
With that, I've shown off my appeal...

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:00.700
Alright, here I come

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.980
It's here! This thing is darn hot!

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:05.980
This is super hot!

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:07.400
What do you think, everyone?

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:08.860
Well, but for the last one...

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.640
Not just me, but I hope that you all will also go make a retort

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.260
Make a retort about my current facial expression and tell me about it in the comments

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.000
*mumbling*, urarara...

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.280
Well, and that was Virtual Youtuber Kizuna Ai

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.480
See you later!

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:25.820
Remember, make a joke about my expression now. I'll be counting on you

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:27.820
