00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:01.780
trHi there!

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:04.400
It's the virtual youtuber, Kizuna Ai!

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:06.860
Everyone, do you all have friends?

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:08.720
Going out to eat together,

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:09.620
Giving advice,

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:10.940
Stealing their crush,

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:13.300
There's all kinds of friends out there,

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:14.220
but I have

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:15.460
Nobody!

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:17.760
There's Rinna, and Siri,

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.340
I kinda thought we were friends, but

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.880
But, y'know, they don't even have bodies,

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.680
So I think that's different from having friends!

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:26.720
So that means!

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.940
I want to make friends!

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:30.300
So I'm gonna create!

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:32.140
To help me make friends, I'm gonna use:

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.860
This! The Unity Asset Store!

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:38.340
Using the search options 3D &gt; Character &gt; Humanoid &gt; Human,

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:40.900
I'm going to buy a new friend!

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:42.860
These are the times we live in!

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.920
Well then, let's have a look!

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.540
Friends are for life, after all!

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:49.840
So I need to make sure I choose carefully!

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.520
I'd rather have a cute girl than some old guy,

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:54.560
Aesthetically.

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.020
Most of these seem to be foreigners.

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:57.620
This girl!

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:00.840
She's so cute!

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:01.780
But!

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.620
But, you know, the aesthetic kinda,

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:05.640
We don't really match.

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.240
Oh wow, there's some really cool guys here too!

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:09.300
Ah, but this is kinda...

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:14.900
Big muscle tough guys aren't really my type,

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:20.300
And if the aesthetic and stuff isn't right it'll look bad for my commercial.

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:22.780
This is hard...

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:25.820
We got a girl with a nice body here.

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:27.820
Something like this wouldn't crossover with me, right?

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:28.700
Her figure is so good!

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:29.840
Giant Titties!

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.540
But I need something a little closer to my appearance...

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.800
Here's one with 3 guys...

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.220
All 3 of them!

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.080
For just 16 U.S. Dollars!

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.880
What a deal!

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:43.740
There's skeletons here too.

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:45.760
They can't talk, since they're dead.

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.100
Oh, she looks tough! She could protect me!

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:50.140
I wanna be protected!

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.940
What should I do, it's so hard to choose~

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:54.820
If only I had more spending power!

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.360
I'd buy them all!

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.900
But it's important to respect your budget as well, you know?

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:01.020
I'm only going to take one!

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:04.000
It pains my heart that I can only take one!

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:08.420
I've decided!

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:10.540
And I've already paid!

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:11.580
Introducing:

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.360
My new friends!

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:14.440
Would you believe it?

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:17.980
All 4 of them in a bundle, on a super cheap deal!

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:19.800
What a deal!

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.060
Value for money is important, right?

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.340
Nice to meet you!

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:23.600
I'm Kizuna Ai!

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.040
What are your names?

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.600
What are your names?

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.360
Looks like they can't talk!

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:39.800
Names, huh...

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.120
I guess I'll name you then!

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:43.880
The smallest one here...

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:46.780
Let's play it safe with "John"!

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.520
John, John.

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.780
He looks John-ish.

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.680
The girl's name should be...

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.540
She's got these weird twin tails...

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:53.740
You're Twintail Girl.

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:55.140
The big one is...

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.900
Michael, Michael!

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:59.560
The Mom looks kind of trendy,

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:01.060
You're Tiffany, OK?

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:02.200
So we have John,

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:04.260
Michael,

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:05.320
Tiffany,

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:06.400
And Twintail Girl!

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.340
These siblings, I'm trying to figure out which is brother and sister...

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:12.580
I mean, you look at the girl over here,

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.620
It kind of looks a litle bit like a guy who was just forced to grow his hair out,

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.600
And did it up in twin tails.

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.400
The mom really really wanted a girl more than anything,

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:25.760
But their first child ended up being a boy,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
So they kiiiiinda....

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.400
Tried making him into a girl.

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:31.300
Something like that.

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.460
So they're brothers! A pair of older and younger brothers.

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:36.580
And there you have it! A family of four,

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:38.980
And myself, Ai-chan! Please look after us!

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.860
We all match!

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:42.840
Since it's a special occasion,

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:46.020
Let's take a photo to commemorate my first friends!

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:49.540
Oh yeah, you guys can't move.

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:51.780
I'll just do the same pose.

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.960
Okay!

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:55.080
Chee...

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:58.320
Movement? you guys are moving now?

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:01.000
Ah, er, a dance?

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:02.260
Excuse me, er,

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:03.700
My leg, ah,

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:05.120
Your arm is near my leg...

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:06.760
It's gone all the way through.

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:08.760
So you guys can't talk but you can move!

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:10.720
Move sooner next time!
