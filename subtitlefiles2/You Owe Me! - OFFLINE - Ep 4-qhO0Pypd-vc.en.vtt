00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:12.080
Hey, what are you doing?

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:13.760
I don't want it

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:20.280
What? I don't understand what you're saying. That's- that's green milk tea, and you barely drank any.

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:21.020
Here I'll take it.

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:22.020
Oh whoa not so fast

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.200
What is it worth to you?

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:27.380
Seriously, you didn't want it like two seconds ago.

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.300
How about a favor I can call on 
anytime, anywhere from you

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.720
Take it or leave it

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.200
Aaah-

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.820
Aaah-

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:39.540
- Aaaah-  
- Fine fine fine fine fine fine, whatever

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:43.700
Perfect.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.580
I mean, who counts favors anyways right? We're all friends here.

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.699
I do! I'd be stupid not to.

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:56.940
He forgets how many favors he owes me. 
That green milk tea thing works every time.

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:03.140
Seriously? That's so lame that you keep track with a notepad.

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:05.680
Be. Creative.

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.000
Wes Pounds! Get it?

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.260
Because it's about to get heavy.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:17.920
In London.

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.680
No. You're embarrassing us.

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.160
What is this? I thought we were having a meeting.

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.000
Just basking in my wealth

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.200
Wes Pounds? Are you keeping count of the favors?
Gimme that.

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.500
Woah woah

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.460
Not until you do me some favors

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:44.100
Wait, so if I do you some favors, do I get a Wes Pound?

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.759
That's how it works

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:48.680
No, that's stupid. I'm not doing that.

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.400
Here Phil, first stack on the house.

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:52.220
Yeah

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.420
Hey, you can't just give them out for free...

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:56.620
But they're mine.

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:57.560
These are worth something.

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:58.660
No, that's mine

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:59.160
Taylor.

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.711
Give me it

00:01:59.711 --> 00:02:00.211
Mine

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:01.940
No mine!

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:02.860
Give it to me!

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:04.860
[grunt]

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:06.160
[gasp]

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.560
My pen fell, Wesley.

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.800
I need someone to Pick. It. Up.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.560
[gasps]

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.700
Thanks, buddy

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.560
Just 4257 to go and you're a free man

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.760
So that meeting?

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.649
I did what I had to do, but it's worth it to get these babies back.

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:47.790
Thanks for the computer Wes.

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.100
Hey, can you help me with this door?

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:53.879
Sorry Tay, but you're out of Wes Pounds now. So it's all over now

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.960
That's fine. I've got Phil Bills.

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:01.560
Christine Coins.

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:03.620
Taylor Favors

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.520
Sorry, I'll use one of these to have Taylor pick it up

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:18.080
Oh my God. 
Across the table.

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:21.960
How is this so hard?

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:23.760
Take them from you.

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:29.460
[breathless laughter]

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.060
Phil's having a heart attack!

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:33.740
Pick. It. Up.

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:35.980
HAHAHA

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:41.800
okay. Pick it up. Wait wait wait, is it like that?

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:43.340
Pick. It. Up.

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.560
[Phil dying of laughter in the background]

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:49.340
Sorry.

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:02.260
Wesley, my pen fell on the floor.

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:03.800
Wesley

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:06.640
my pen fell on the floor.

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:10.840
I need someone to Pick. It. Up.

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:14.120
He's a monster!

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.060
So that meeting?

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:20.000
Phil? Phil!

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:22.360
[Christine laughing in background]

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.700
Man, that Taylor guy's kind of a jerk.

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:27.140
He's kind of weird.

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:28.420
He's kind of mean to you.

00:04:28.424 --> 00:04:30.840
Yeah, I don't know where that came from

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:38.300
He actually thought of that all on his own. I don't know, he has like some pent-up anger.

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:41.360
