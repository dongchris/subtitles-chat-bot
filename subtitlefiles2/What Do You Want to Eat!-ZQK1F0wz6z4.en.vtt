00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:11.220
Hey, you need this?

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:13.220
Oh yeah, thanks. Good work today, Steve.

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:15.760
[phone vibrates]

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.660
Let's get dinner tonight. Can you pick? I don't care where.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.600
I've heard those words before...

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.199
Always an ordeal...

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:28.799
Never ending well. "We always go there!"

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:31.240
"Just pick one!"

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:32.469
"Anything but that."

00:00:32.469 --> 00:00:34.469
"But everything is closing!" *Groan*

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:37.691
I'm starving. What are you doing for dinner?

00:00:37.691 --> 00:00:38.579
Not now, Steve!

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:42.689
What should we eat? What should we eat?

00:00:44.289 --> 00:00:46.709
What should we eat, what should we eat? What should we eat? *Gasp of realization*

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.149
Hey!

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:57.149
So did you pick a place?

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.289
Even better. You did.

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:01.180
What? How is that possible?

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:04.760
Because I finally learned how to answer the most difficult question a couple has to face every day.

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.460
"What do you want to eat?" You see, in the past, no matter how many suggestions

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:14.020
I give you, you reject all of them! We debate for hours and hours! Sometimes to the point.. where I go hungry.

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:20.400
But not tonight. I've got a plan that's gonna figure out exactly what we want to eat for dinner with zero stress and 100% satisfaction.

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:22.643
How long will this take?

00:01:22.643 --> 00:01:23.500
Have a seat!

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.020
Let's start with this.

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.480
What is that?

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:35.620
It's a fortune from Panda Express. See, I know you're always craving their orange chicken and their honey walnut shrimp.

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.340
It's like your comfort food.

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.900
And what's more comforting than a fortune cookie which you always end the meal with?

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.380
I always ask for two.

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.689
But when I was dropping off our dry cleaning this morning,

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:50.898
I was checking pockets, and I found this fortune in the pants you wore to work yesterday, so I'm guessing you just had Panda. Not surprised.

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.319
Okay, but what does that have to do with tonight?

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:56.250
Well,
do you remember what your fortune said?

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.109
Uh, something about having to smile soon.

00:01:58.109 --> 00:02:04.488
Exactly, and smiling made you think of "cheese!" and cheese made you think of cheeseburgers, and judging by the extra burger shack napkins that you

00:02:04.488 --> 00:02:06.420
have in your purse over there...

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.940
I'm guessing that's what you had for dinner yesterday.

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:10.120
How did you...

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:11.200
Ah!

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:18.580
But, while you were eating your burger, you immediately started to crave something else. Mexican food. Why? Because as you were eating, you started to think...

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:20.440
why is it called a hamburger if...

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.140
If there's no ham in it. Seriously, why?

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.060
Ham, pig, pork, you wanted a carnitas bowl, which is what you have for lunch today.

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.360
But something was missing. Say ah.

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.200
Ah?

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:32.860
No avocado.

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:38.680
But you love avocado. You would never pass up a chance to add avocado to a meal. Unless it was overpriced.

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.560
Why pay two dollars...

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.500
For a half an avocado you can get two for the price of one. You're so frugal.

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:45.859
It's basic economics.

00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:51.739
But that left you craving avocados all day. You still had to seize your omega-3s, which leads us to the obvious answer.

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:55.480
Betsy's Diner for their famous cobb salad, avocado included.

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:57.560
Sounds great! Let's go there.

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:02.860
Sure, we could go there, except after you finish your salad, you would start munching on my chili fries,

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.359
and then you would begin to complain that you're eating too unhealthy,

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:10.580
considering that you're trying to slim down in order to look "hotter than the other bridesmaids" at Teresa's wedding next month.

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:12.580
Wait! I never told you that.

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:16.220
You also never told me that you had the answer to our dilemma this entire time.

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.840
I do?

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:17.560
Yep.

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.480
We've been watching nature documentaries this whole week. Tonight was gonna be about the salmon migration. Which, as I suspected,

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:25.459
you started without me.

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.480
After spawning, all Pacific salmon die and the salmon life cycle starts again.

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:32.500
Okay. So what? I got a head start.

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:33.600
What does it have to do with dinner?

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:39.300
Well, all you can think about right now is salmon skin rolls and sashimi. Therefore, sushi buffet!

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:40.600
Great! Let's do that.

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:48.440
But! There was a small earthquake on the Izu Peninsula that affected a nearby nuclear plant, causing it to leak into local streams

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.800
contaminating all farms of

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.692
Eutrema japonicum

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:53.380
Huh?

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:54.560
Also known as

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:59.720
wasabi. You'd see a clickbait video about the contamination on the way to the buffet and be afraid of getting sick.

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:03.840
I'd then suggest not risking it, because well, we're out of toilet paper.

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.060
You forgot to buy toilet paper.

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:09.500
You know how bad my memory is. My point is

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:15.220
why go out and risk nuclear wasabi poisoning when we could save money and cook a delicious meal right here at home?

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.340
Sure fine, but what will we make?

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:20.791
Obviously, my famous chicken carbonara that you love so much.

00:04:20.791 --> 00:04:22.230
Actually, that sounds great.

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:23.740
But we're out of eggs

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:24.780
[chicken cluck]

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:26.660
You forgot to buy eggs, too

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:28.510
It doesn't matter.

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:35.540
Because you wouldn't want pasta anyways, because when we eat pasta we always pair with wine. My chicken carbonara recipe uses breast meat, and everyone

00:04:35.549 --> 00:04:39.380
knows that white meat goes best with white wine, like a sauvignon blanc, which I also didn't buy,

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:44.159
but at home, all we have is red wines. And I'm not about to serve white meat with a Zinfandel!

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:50.580
So I was gonna go to the grocery store to buy toilet paper, eggs, and a perfectly dry Chardonnay, until I remembered that it's been

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:55.830
exactly three years since September 2014, the last time the sun emitted a significant solar flare,

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:00.089
which has since ever so slightly affected soil temperatures in the Burgundy region of France. Which,

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:03.809
undoubtedly, would ruin any recent production of our favorite brand of wine.

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:07.570
What!?!

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:12.059
Are you crazy? I just asked you to pick a place to eat. Why are you making it so complicated?

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:14.909
It should be black and white. It shouldn't be this hard!

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:17.860
Exactly!

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:19.000
Huh?

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
What's the opposite of hard?

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:26.549
Easy? No, soft. What's black, white, and soft?

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
Told you I had a plan.

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:40.760
Orange chicken and honey walnut shrimp always hit the spot. Thanks, babe. But next time, let's just go with our first instinct.

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:44.760
Hey, I guess your fortune was right.

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:48.480
What do you want for dessert?

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.940
Hey, what are you guys doing here?

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:55.420
Not now Steve!

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:00.140
It's Chris.

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:13.800
Hey everyone, hope you guys liked that video. It was definitely inspired by true events. Why is it so difficult to decide what to eat?

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:16.879
Thank you so much to Panda Express for partnering with us.

00:06:16.879 --> 00:06:21.499
We're actually doing a really fun contest with them where we're gonna be bringing a few special fans

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:26.509
Panda Express right to their door. All you have to do is on social media use Twitter or an Instagram.

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:31.669
Show us in a fun way what gives you comfort, and use the hashtag my kind of comfort.

00:06:31.669 --> 00:06:34.489
It could be a picture of your mom. It could be a gif of your pets.

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:40.159
Just get creative. All the details are down below. We can't wait to bring you some Panda. See you guys next time. Bye!
