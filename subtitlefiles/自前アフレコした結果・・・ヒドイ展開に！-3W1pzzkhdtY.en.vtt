00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.500
Hello Everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai here!

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:05.180
You all love my voice, right?

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:07.400
Hmm...? Hmm... Hmm... Of course you do.

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:09.500
I love it too ♥

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:10.360
With that being said...

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.140
... Today planned something to use my beautiful voice.

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:15.320
"Kizuna Ai will turn into a voice actress!!"

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:17.420
And having said that, let's start now!

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.940
... Today I'll use this app that lets people turn into voice actors...

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:24.780
... It's called "SAY-U"

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:26.400
Oohh... I see...

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.040
I have to choose one of these official plays, right?

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.060
There are so many of them, aren't there?

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:33.260
Hmm...

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:34.840
Which one should I pick?

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.560
Doesn't this one look like a sponsored program?

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:38.960
No, this is not a sponsored program!

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.180
An app is not the same thing as a sponsored program, right?

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:43.000
Aaaaahhh!

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.060
Even when it isn't a sponsored program...

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.680
... The fact that it's telling me that an app is an sponsored program...

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:51.540
Ah!

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:52.680
This one!

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.240
If we talk about androids, this is related with I.A.s

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:56.860
And if we talk about high school students...

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:58.320
... We are talking about girls that are around 16 years old, maybe?

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.640
That means it is ideal for me.

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:02.240
I'll pick this one! This one!

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.580
In that case, let's start with "The android and the high school student"!

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.220
*Making breadstick noises*

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:08.860
"The android and..."

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:10.860
"Rocket Fist"

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.280
*Sleeping Android*

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:15.740
... Uuhhhh...

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:17.920
"Shut up, I can't sleep."

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:20.280
"Sigh"

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.360
"It's because you're very noisy."

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.880
"Of course I'll get mad if you interrupt me when I'm sleeping."

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:29.000
"..."

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:33.080
"Eh? Are you the one who created me?"

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:38.360
"I wish I was born next to someone more intelligent than you."

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:39.820
"... The high school student!"
*Making high school student voices*

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:41.940
"Hum, hum... Finally..."

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:43.760
"I'm finally done with it!"

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:45.260
"My android a female type one!"

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.080
"I'll call you 'A.I.003'!!"

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.940
"Oh, man. It's unbelievable, a student that is about to start high school just made the invention of the century!"

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.600
"I'm definitely an amazing genius! Hahahaha!"

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:57.360
"UGH!"

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.800
"Why do you think you're doing so suddenly!!"

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.960
"But still, you don't have a reason to use the Rocket Fist so soon!"

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.140
"Don't you think that you shouldn't use violence against your creator?!"

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:07.180
"That's right."

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.720
"I, the genius scientific, after working so hard for a whole year..."

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.920
"WH-WHAT?"

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:15.380
Alright!

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:16.680
I'm done recording the voices.

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.700
Well, in that case, do you wanna listen to my debut as a voice actress?

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:21.680
Let's do it!

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:22.240
Hoi! Hmm...?
*Record playing*

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:23.860
*Record playing*

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:24.940
"The android and..."

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:26.260
"... The high school student!"

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:29.340
"Rocket Fist"

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.100
The sound is too low!

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.820
"Hum, hum... Finally..."

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:38.860
"I'm finally done with it!"

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.540
Th-the sound is so low, don't you think so?
*Yukiko Fujimura (16 years)*

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.680
"My android a female type one!"

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.720
"I'll call you 'A.I.003'!!"

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:50.960
You all can tell that that's my voice, right?
"..."

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.840
"Oh, man. It's unbelievable, a student that is about to start high school just made the invention of the century!"

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.520
That's definitely my voice, isn't it?
"I'm definitely an amazing genius! Hahahaha!"

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.140
"I'm definitely an amazing genius! Hahahaha!"

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:04.440
Alright...!

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.160
I'm a genius as well.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.340
You can see that I'm a genius in all of my characters.

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:09.680
"UGH!"

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:11.420
It seems painful.

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.620
"Shut up, I can't sleep."

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:15.220
Oh!

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:16.600
Ooohh?
"Sigh"

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:18.880
The android's voice...

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.140
... It's too low, isn't it?
"What do you think you're doing so suddenly!!"

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:21.300
"What do you think you're doing so suddenly!!"

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.440
"It's because you're very noisy."

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.040
You can't listen to it, can you?
"Of course I'll get mad if you interrupt me when I'm sleeping."

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.420
"Of course I'll get mad if you interrupt me when I'm sleeping."

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:31.220
Definitely, when I did the student's voice...
"But still, you don't have a reason to use the Rocket Fist so soon!"

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.960
"But still, you don't have a reason to use the Rocket Fist so soon!"

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.060
... I finally did it as I was supposed to do it, right?

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.760
"Don't you think that you shouldn't use violence against your creator?!"

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.180
"..."

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:43.700
"Eh? Are you the one who crea...?"

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:45.620
Ah, it cut out...
"That's right."

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.640
Definitely, the voice actors should...
"I, the genius scientific, after working so hard for a whole year..."

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.220
... Work within the available time.
"I, the genius scientific, after working so hard for a whole year..."

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:53.160
It's hard, isn't it?

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.680
"I wish I was born next to someone more intelligent than you."

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.480
That's an annoying line, isn't it?
"I wish I was born next to someone more intelligent than you."

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.120
"WH-WHAT?"

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:03.060
Definitely...

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:04.340
... That's me.

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.500
No, but, don't you think that...?

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:09.400
... I did pretty good even when it was my first time?

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.980
Oh, man. I'm definitely a genius.

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:13.360
I see, I see.

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:14.840
I.A.s are pretty cool, aren't they?

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:15.480
But, but...

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:19.240
... Voice actors have to do a lot of different characters and, just as it happened to me...

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:22.300
... They have to make sure not to over extend a lot, they're amazing, aren't they?

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.600
I wonder if I can do it correctly.

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:27.600
I'll take this chance to make another play.

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:30.020
I'll make another one related with androids. Here it is!

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.520
♪ Tiríin! ♪

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:32.960
"My android is a NEET"

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:34.860
Oh, man. A NEET. That's great, isn't it?

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:38.780
If I had to talk about me... I think I'd die if I never worked, but...

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:40.400
I was a NEET for about a month...

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:41.880
Ah, I don't want to be banned again.

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:43.880
It was because of the ban that I became a NEET.

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:44.440
Alright.

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:45.500
Let's do this!

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:47.480
*Making Dr. Okazaki's voice*

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:49.640
"My android is a NEET"

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:54.480
"Kaka, you're a high class android and you don't even help us. All you do is just wasting your time."

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:59.180
"You have the ideal structure to be an assistant android, can you at least give me my tools?"

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:02.980
"If you can't do that, then you're worst than the lowest class android!"

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:06.100
"Eeeh? Really? In that case, I'm counting on you."

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:07.540
"Kaka, the screwdriver."

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:10.520
"AAAHHHHHHH!"

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:11.020
*Making the android's voice*

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:12.380
"What did you say?"
*Making the android's voice*

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:15.380
"Doctor, there's certain limit to taunt me..."

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:18.780
"... Of course that I can give you your tools."

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:20.100
Alright, in that case...!

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:21.200
Do you wanna listen to it?

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:21.780
Hoi!
*Record playing*

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:22.960
*Record playing*

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:26.400
"My android is a NEET"

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:32.220
As a matter of fact, if an android becomes a NEET, it ends up being completely useless, right?

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:33.820
"Kaka, you're a high class android and you don't even help us. All you do is just wasting your time."

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:38.580
"You have the ideal structure to be an assistant android, can you at least give me my tools?"

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:40.340
Watch carefully.

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:44.360
"If you can't do that, then you're worst than the lowest class android!"

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:46.360
"What did you say?"

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:48.100
Hahaha!

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:51.440
"Doctor, there's certain limit to taunt me..."

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:55.280
"... Of course that I can give you your tools."

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:00.240
"Eeeh? Really? In that case, I'm counting on you."

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:03.460
This...

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:05.320
Hurts, doesn't it?

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:07.520
"Kaka, the screwdriver."

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:10.460
It goes through both extremes.

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:12.880
"AAAHHHHHHH!"

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:15.280
My scream is so bad!!

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:18.000
A.I.Channel!

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:19.920
Hmm... So yeah...

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:23.060
I took the chance to do it with a different situation.

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:25.820
*Playing a different version*

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:28.360
"My android is a NEET!"

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:30.160
It's amazing, isn't it?

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:35.440
"Kaka, you're a high class android and you don't even help us. All you do is just wasting your time."

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:37.800
I put all my soul there, right?
"You have the ideal structure to be an assistant..."

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:38.480
"YEEEEEEEE!"

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:40.860
I got tongue-tied! I got tongue-tied!
"YEEEEEEEE!"

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:46.160
"If you can't do that, then you're worst than the lowest class android!"

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:47.940
"What did you say?"

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:50.760
In what kind of world are they living?

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:53.260
"Doctor, there's certain limit to taunt me..."

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:57.280
"... Of course that I can give you your tools."

00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:58.800
What kind of world is that one?

00:06:58.800 --> 00:06:59.740
"Yaaay??"

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:01.340
Yaay? *Laughs*
"Really? In that case, I'm counting on you."

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:02.800
No Yaay!

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:05.100
"¡Kaka, the screeeewdriiiiiiveeeer!"

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:07.220
It gives the drawing a feeling of excitement!

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:10.060
"AAAAAAHHHH!"

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:11.360
"JUSTICE!"

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:13.500
That's a line for Sunshine Ikezaki-san, isn't it?
(A Japanese comedian)

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:14.540
That was perfect.

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:16.020
Alright! With that being said...

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:18.480
I tried to do voices from different characters!

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:19.460
How was it?

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:23.960
Oh, man. I hope that a lot of important businessmen watch this video...

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:27.400
... And they decide to hire me, I'm pretty sure that they did.

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:28.340
Alright, with that being said!

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:30.040
I'll be waiting for your messages!!

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:33.620
This was Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai! See you soon!
