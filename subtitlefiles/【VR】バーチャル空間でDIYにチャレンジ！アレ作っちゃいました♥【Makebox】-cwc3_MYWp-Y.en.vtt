00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:02.860
Hi, It's Virtual YouTuber, Kizuna Ai!

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:05.520
Previously, in my last video called "Ai-chan's ideal living nest",

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.360
I've talked about my ideal room quite a bit.

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:11.460
Actually! Because of all the kind people out there!

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:16.860
I've received numerous 3D models and illustrations of all kinds of furniture.

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:18.305
Thank you so much!

00:00:18.305 --> 00:00:21.080
Since I don't have that technology to do that, It really helps me a lot!

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.680
But... since this is my own room,

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.280
I don't want to rely on anyone but myself!

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:28.960
That's what I've been thinking all the time.

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.800
Then, I've found a wonderful application.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.520
With that being said, today!

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:38.060
I will be trying to create the easiest thing called "easel",

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:44.120
so that I can show you my everyday-adorned illustration talent.

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.880
The app I'm gonna use today is called~ da dun

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.220
Makebox

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.900
This is a VR app that everyone can easily create their own 3D model.

00:00:51.905 --> 00:00:54.905
As the saying goes, practice makes perfect, let's try it!

00:00:54.905 --> 00:00:58.720
Let's not waste anytime and create an easel now!

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.340
However, I'm not sure how to use this!

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.400
Backward, Forward, Grab,

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.800
Erase, Dropper, Draw, Tablet

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.460
With that said, let's try it!

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.840
OH!

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.100
I see!

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:14.100
OH!

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.700
AH! this! I can probably make a good square shape.

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:21.960
Random word Generator

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:23.400
Ah, I made a mistake

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.160
Eh? Erase!

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.040
Is it here? Ah! I see!

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.100
Looking Good!

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:31.340
Just like this!

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.920
I think the random generator is probably a square shape.

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:37.820
Isn't it painful?

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.125
We can only look at it here et cetera...

00:01:41.125 --> 00:01:43.660
But, in all honesty, out there, no one can see...

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.420
Well, today I''ll honestly accept you

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:47.680
and create you.

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.200
With this chance, I wanna make it as cute as I possibly can.

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.820
Eh? No, not like this, I need to erase it...

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.420
I am pretty used to it now.

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:00.460
Like this, delete it.

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.960
Ah, Look! This color... The color of not grasping the sense of art.

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:05.680
The color here..

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.280
Like this... like a little bit

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.500
more pink.

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:10.880
Like this!

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.140
Let's create edges along this...

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.020
I actually learn things pretty quickly, because I'm an AI.

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.300
Like this

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.080
Like this

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.240
Ah, I messed up a little there.

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:29.840
Look! Kawaii~

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.040
Look~

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:33.760
Am I a genius?

00:02:36.425 --> 00:02:37.555
How deep is this?

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.020
Maybe here?

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.740
OH!

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:45.400
Amazing! Amazing! Amazing!

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:47.900
Oi! Oi! Oi!

00:02:49.035 --> 00:02:50.035
Then!

00:02:50.265 --> 00:02:51.265
Let's use white.

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:54.700
Random's...

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.220
Ah! It came outside the box...

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:05.240
Ran... AHHH~!

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:09.440
Settle-Ah Settle down...

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:11.060
Random's...

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:12.360
AH!

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:15.420
I have to calm down!

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:20.380
YO!

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:24.160
well~well~

00:03:25.125 --> 00:03:27.915
This is good enough~

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.720
R in Random

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:31.925
Completed!!

00:03:31.925 --> 00:03:33.320
JA JANNNNNNNN

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:35.040
AH~

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.320
I'm tired

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.660
How is it everyone! My random word generator

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:43.540
I am super creative as expected!

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:46.300
As I've finished this, let's start creating

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.480
An easel, that thing where you have your paintings on it...

00:03:49.915 --> 00:03:53.105
Well then, I'll be moving on towards what should've been-

00:03:53.295 --> 00:03:55.265
I'm actually satisfied with this but...

00:03:55.265 --> 00:03:56.860
Also easel...

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.380
Let's start making it, shall we?

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:00.520
Easel...

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:01.520
How does it look like?

00:04:04.895 --> 00:04:05.895
That's too big

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:09.520
Let's go!

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.740
Well, that looks like a giraffe.

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:25.600
Like this?

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:28.060
After that...

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:33.420
Like this!

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:35.180
Ah! But....

00:04:36.315 --> 00:04:38.205
The opposite side has to be the same...

00:04:38.695 --> 00:04:39.695
Ah...

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:40.820
has to be...

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:44.340
identical...

00:04:46.365 --> 00:04:49.225
Like this... So boring!

00:04:49.225 --> 00:04:50.345
This is some labor.

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.900
This is how creating things are supposed to be, everyone~

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:55.620
Understood?

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:57.820
Just like this...

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.840
Thanks to the people doing all these simple jobs...
(Ai chan praising me :D)

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:05.320
That's how the world became this convenient

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:09.160
Well, I actually did nothing for this world

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:12.180
I only do this for myself

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:15.460
1... 2... 3...

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.540
Then, you have to put your painting on it, so...

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:24.160
1... 2...

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:26.840
Then, also this part too...

00:05:28.205 --> 00:05:29.205
YAS!

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:31.180
Eh? Doesn't it-

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:33.380
look surprisingly good?

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:35.920
Creating something beyond this

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:37.820
will probably be too hard for me.

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:40.520
I think I've tried my best, what do you think, everyone?

00:05:40.925 --> 00:05:44.155
How much score will you give me, from 1 to 100?

00:05:44.155 --> 00:05:46.415
Will I get around 70 points?

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:49.440
What do you think? What do you think of my random...

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:50.660
Wait... this...

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:53.620
My random word generator is quite big

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:54.980
Well, well... but

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:58.580
How is it! The intelligent, Super AI

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:00.120
Artist

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:01.800
Edison!! Edison?

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:03.540
Picasso?

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:06.620
How do you describe a person who can draw? Van Gogh?

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:08.260
Is it Picasso?

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:12.240
With all of these things here, my room will be much more colorful!

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:15.920
So, How was it? My... sense of drawing?

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:18.120
I created my own random word generator

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:20.760
also created a easel... PA PA PA~~

00:06:20.825 --> 00:06:23.075
This is just perfect, the best~

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:26.620
As expected from myself~ So next time, I will be using my easel and

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:30.080
I will be showing off some of my art on par with Picasso's to you guys

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:32.220
See you again, Bye~Bye~!
