00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.720
Hi everyone! Virtual Youtuber Kizuna Ai here!

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:04.720
Well, as you all know...

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:07.580
I'm a Super A.I.~

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:10.800
That means... I'm very smart.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.620
Let's just say I'm very intelligent~

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:16.820
Regardless whether it's body language or manner of speaking...

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:21.360
Isn't there someone at your workplace or school that makes you think, "Wow, that person is so smart!"?

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:26.660
So today, I'll teach you all about the way capable people act and speak!

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:28.940
Without further ado, let's try!

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:33.640
Um, excuse me, could you please go back to the previous slide for a bit?

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.040
Ah, okay, thanks. You may continue.

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:43.520
"Requesting someone to return to the previous slide during a presentation."

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:47.800
Even if you don't really have a reason to, ask the presenter to go back to the previous slide.

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:51.900
With only that, you'll look like you are really passionate about the topic.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.100
Uh, well, about that... Let's talk about it when we are on the way to the train station?

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.080
"Talk about work even while you're walking."

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:05.820
Do that even if you are free. That will let others perceive you as busy even if you really aren't.

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:14.060
If one is blindfolded, one wouldn't be able to see in front, right?

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.900
"State something obvious that others can't refute as if it were natural."

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:24.520
Say something obvious that can't be refuted like it's an incredibly deep truth.

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.180
That will make you appear extremely natural and smart.

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.720
Hmmm, I see. Well, I have two things to say about that.

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.580
"Begin your argument with 'having two things to say about it'."

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:42.600
If you begin your statements with 'I have two things to say about it', you'll impress your peers.

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.980
In this case, it's best if you make your first point as long-winded as possible.

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:55.620
That way, even if you don't have a second thing to say, the person you converse with won't even realize it most of the time, so there's no need to worry about that.

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:57.740
Oh, that's a great question coming from you.

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.160
You've brought up a pretty decent point.

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.520
Well, as much as I'd like to continue our conversation, I'm afraid we can only do so later.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.300
"If there are questions during your presentation, shrug it off by saying 'That is a good question' without actually answering that question."

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.580
If possible, exaggerate how good that question is as much as you can.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.640
If you cannot think of an adequate answer to that question during that time,

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.960
just say "Even though I understand where you're coming from with your question, I have no choice but to end my presentation now".

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.280
Everyone would surely forget that it even happened a short moment later.

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:31.900
Eh? That's weird. I should have one last business card in here--

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.900
Ah! Here it is.

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.900
When giving someone your business card, make sure to tell them that it's the last one you have.

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:44.280
During a business card exchange, saying that will make the other person think that you're an extremely well-connected person.

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.240
"Ah, wonderful! Here's my last business card!"

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:51.580
Saying that will make it even more effective.

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:53.700
Well, everyone's voiced their opinion, right?

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:58.180
Well then, let's adjourn!

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:02.040
Say "Well then, let's adjourn!" after everyone has voiced their opinions in a meeting.

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:10.000
If you say that before anyone else, it'll make the others think of you as the one responsible for the meeting.

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:11.980
Ai Channel.

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:13.600
How was it?

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:19.140
By the way, if you say 'let's keep this between us, okay?',

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.620
I bet you'll make those around you think, 'That person is so smart!'

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:25.880
'Let's keep this between us'

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.860
That was your Virtual Youtuber Kizuna Ai speaking!

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:30.980
See you~

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:37.860
