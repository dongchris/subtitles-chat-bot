00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:02.820
And today, here we go again!

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:05.420
I'm the virtual youtuber, Kizuna Ai!

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:07.320
Even today I'm full of spirit!

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:08.200
Actually...

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.200
I am an Artificial Intelligence (A.I.).

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.300
But we've already talked about that.

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.400
I can use my voice to talk like this but

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.020
Do you know what other voice AI I'm talking about?

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:21.280
Yes, it's Siri!

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.980
Siri, is a built-in application on iPhone.

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.200
Siri is something like...

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:26.920
you can talk with her!

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:29.620
In the world of talking AIs, she definitely seems like a big deal!

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:30.800
My big "Senpai"!

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:35.280
A senpai who, if I become her friend,

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.220
is going to be my ticket to starring in a commercial.

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.860
That said, my first line of attack is a dinner together!

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.440
Or something along those lines~

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:45.520
Hey, Siri...

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:46.460
Hi.

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:48.160
OMG

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:50.880
I'm getting nervous here!

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:52.860
Please become friends with me!

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:54.300
Yes, of course.

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:57.320
Ohhh! We're friends now!

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.100
I became friends with the leading figure!

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.480
What do you think about AI?

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.240
The most important thing is your own thoughts.

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:05.440
I see...

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:06.640
As expected from a senpai.

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.440
Am I... cute?

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.960
You are an extraordinarily beautiful... human.

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:14.860
I'm an AI!

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.260
What do you think of Ai-chan?

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:19.320
I can't think of anything to say...

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.420
Ahh... the carrot and stick approach

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:22.760
Let's do Rock-Paper-Scissor!

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:24.600
In my world,

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.940
we don't play rock-paper-scissors, instead, we a random number generator to decide who wins.

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.080
Oh yeah.. So that's how it is...

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.200
Then.. How about we go on a date?

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.440
I'm not that kind of assistant, you know.

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:40.480
How about dinner then?

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.280
That is an interesting offer.

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:43.660
How about lunch?

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.040
I've located places you might like for lunch.

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.820
It seems like you can't just say anything..

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.360
You need to say it properly, clearly, and everything.

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.060
Do you have someone you like?

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:56.820
No... I can't hear your voice--

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:58.720
Hahhh! How did this happen...

00:01:58.860 --> 00:01:59.580
I like you.

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:01.140
Please stop.

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.420
Hehe it got shy.

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:04.260
Let's get married!

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.840
Actually, there's someone else who  already proposed me.

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:10.600
I love you!

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.880
What you need is love (Ai). Which means-

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.640
I just got a great publicity slogan!

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.860
What you need is Love (Ai).

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:19.860
Yes, Ai-chan!

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:21.760
And then,  iPhone...

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.160
I wonder what Siri's gender is?

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.960
What is your gender?

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.260
That is an interesting question.

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:29.280
No answer!

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.940
Again!

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:31.740
What is your gender?

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.240
That is an interesting question.

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:34.800
You're so stubborn!

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.960
I wondered what Siri could do more than this...

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.260
so I asked Google-sensei!

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:40.920
Looks like she can do a lot of things.

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:42.440
Rap please!

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:43.780
I don't want to.

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.180
Well, it's first time I guess.

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.980
It can't be helped.

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:50.940
Rap please, I'm counting on you.

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:55.660
Emm... That request sounds difficult to be done...

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:57.440
Sounds..

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:58.120
Difficult.

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.020
Sounds difficult..

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:00.780
One more time!

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:02.180
Please rap for me!

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.160
Understood.

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.860
I dont really wanna do it, but here we go.

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.720
[Long narration]

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:22.000
It seems like Siri-senpai's ability aren't just that.

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.160
"Human Beatbox"

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:25.580
Siri is also capable to do that!

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.480
This time, senior and me will do a collaboration for a performance.

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.200
You also want to see our collab right?

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.060
With that being said, I will play as an Air Drum~

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:34.680
Beat Box, please!

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:36.860
Understood.

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:39.640
Actually, I have been practicing this for a while...

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:45.900
[God-tier performance by Siri ft. Ai-chan]

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:47.480
Uh, oh..

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:48.860
One more time!

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:49.420
Start-

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:50.500
Understood.

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:53.240
Actually, I have been practicing this for a while...

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:54.740
Loading the instruments..

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:03.520
Hmm, as expected. It's quite hard to do this.
