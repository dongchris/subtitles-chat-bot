00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:02.820
Hello everyone! Virtual Youtuber Kizuna Ai here!

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:04.200
Today, we're going to do an..

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.900
"Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response"

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.940
Also known as ASMR!

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:11.240
I plan to make everyone experience it personally!

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:12.760
Simply said..

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:14.680
It's a phenomenon of making your brain tremble..

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:16.640
Like being immersed in a film and it feels good..

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.240
It's like as if your brain is melting, right?

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.020
Rather than explaining it, let's try listening to it!

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:22.600
Everyone..

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:26.760
Are you ready to put on your earphones and headphones?

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.000
Please make sure to put them on!

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.080
Let's not wait anymore, let's go!

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:51.520
*Sounds of pencil writing*

00:00:53.040 --> 00:01:15.800
*Sound of crumpling papers*

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:33.720
*Sounds of ripping paper*

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:35.740
*Virtual ear cleaning*

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.380
Welcome back~!

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:38.760
Good work today as usual!

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Eh?

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.040
Somehow, you look very tired, right?

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:46.080
Ah!

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:47.160
It's true

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.240
Let's do a virtual ear cleaning~

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.500
The right ear and...

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:54.500
The left one..

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:56.100
Which one do you prefer?

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:00.700
Do you prefer this one?

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:02.640
Wah!?

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:04.480
You have an incredible virus!

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:06.340
In this case..

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.560
I'll start with the left ear, yes?

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:27.440
*Sounds of ear cleaning*

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.120
How was it?

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.580
Does it... hurt?

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:34.120
Good..

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.000
Then, I'll continue..

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.840
*Sounds of ear cleaning*

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.560
You've worked hard at your job again today~

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:48.820
Good job! Good job!

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:58.240
*Sounds of ear cleaning*

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:01.740
What do you think?

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:03.320
Is it clean now?

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:04.540
Hmm..

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:06.220
Then...

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.220
Next up is the right one, alright?

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:25.300
*Sounds of ear cleaning*

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:26.700
Oh!

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.120
This looks wonderful!

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:30.980
It's cleaned up well~

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:38.260
*Sounds of ear cleaning*

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:38.880
Hmm~

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:40.600
You know..

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.420
I was thinking about playing games together after you came back~

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:46.060
So I made some preparations~

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:49.180
Let's play together after this, alright?

00:03:53.140 --> 00:04:04.480
*Sound of ear cleaning*

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:18.960
*Sounds of ear cleaning and music box*

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.220
Good!

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:20.880
What do you think?

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.120
It's cleaned now~

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:23.860
Ja, jaan!

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:24.460
Hmm..

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:26.280
Huh?

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:28.520
Eh? I finished...

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:30.060
Hmm?

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:31.740
Eh?

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.460
Are you...

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.420
Are you.. sleeping?

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:39.480
Hmm...

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:42.600
..Goodnight

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:45.080
