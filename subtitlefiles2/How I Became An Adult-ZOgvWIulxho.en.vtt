00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:08.939
Why would you go to your ex-girlfriend's birthday party?

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:18.080
It seemed like a good idea. You two ended months ago, and on good terms

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.200
She even told you about her new boyfriend!

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.600
But still, you didn't think it would sting this much

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.380
Look at him. Home owner, entrepreneur,

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.360
food connoisseur, all the '-eurs'!

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:38.400
He's a self-made man! He even made you this drink, something de fleur?

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.860
Ugh, another '-eur'

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.890
Even you have to admit

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.600
What a catch!

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.649
He's got his life together, like a real adult

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.559
My god!

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.169
Is that a simple human trash can?

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.739
Those things are like super fancy

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:05.359
Charlie might as well be the personification of a simple human trashcan

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:07.650
Elegant,

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.390
classy,

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.390
stainless-steel

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.729
And what are you?

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.340
Oh my god, what is that?

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.130
That can't be your trashcan!

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:28.879
You've been using the same one ever since you moved into college but you never realized it got this bad

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.119
Was that stain always there?

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:39.350
Was that stain always there? Your place is a mess; no your life is a mess

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.905
You're late on rent

00:01:41.905 --> 00:01:43.740
Your voicemail is full

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.260
Your food's expired

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:46.900
Your style's expired

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.300
Who knew holding on to all this stuff would actually show how much you let yourself go?

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.820
Maybe that's why I should let you go

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:04.040
And who could blame her? There's no one to blame but yourself, you've been living like a twenty-one-year-old for nine years

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.420
Time to grow the fuck up

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.590
First things first,

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.200
Finances. Rent, utilities, insurance

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.000
What the hell is credit, and why is everyone telling me it's so low?

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.800
Hey, hundred is perfect.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.320
Not when it's out of 850

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:34.500
Oh god.

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:42.000
You need to get your money in check. Hell, your checks aren't even in check. Learn how to budget and stick with it

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:46.309
Because if you spend more then you need to earn more. You want to earn moreâ€¦

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.340
you need a better job

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.829
But wait, as you sift through job listing after job listing

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:00.320
you realize all this effort you're putting in is toward a position you don't even care about

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:05.689
That's when it hits you: you don't just need a job, you need to start your...

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.230
career

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:13.310
For the first time since your dorm spicy wing challenge in college, you're building yourself toward a single goal

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.869
Sure that might mean starting off at the bottom rung, but at least it's on a ladder you want to climb

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:27.440
Assuming someone hires you.

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:28.908
"They'll see you now, are you ready?"

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:31.600
Are you?

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.220
You think you are

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:37.399
You've updated your very short resume, cleaned yourself up, put on a tie

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:45.320
But, you have no interview skills and that's okay you'll do better...

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:46.840
...next time

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.060
...and the next time

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:49.580
...and the next time

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:51.620
and then, one sticks!

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:52.340
"See you Monday"

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:54.880
Congratulations!

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:55.920
You're employed!

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.560
You finally convinced someone to give you a chance

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.000
They liked you on paper and now it's time to play the part

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.399
You should probably look the part too

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.160
"I am so sorry, oh sh..."

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.470
Don't worry, you won't be needing that shirt anymore

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:21.460
It's true!

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:25.180
The clothes don't make the man, the man makes the clothes

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:29.299
But it doesn't hurt to update your wardrobe to this decade, and your haircut!

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:33.340
Read a fashion article here and there, learn the basics

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:35.209
"My belt and dress shoes have to match?"

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:37.110
Yep!

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.110
What else do you not know?

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:41.000
The proper way to squat

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.340
The difference between a dumbbell and a kettlebell

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:47.440
The fact that getting that sexy bod isn't just about exercise but also about...

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:48.700
...your diet!

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:52.540
You can't rely solely on your metabolism to take care of that 4 a.m.

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.140
breakfast burrito anymore

00:04:54.140 --> 00:05:00.019
And let's face it, five years of pizza rolls and dino nuggets has taken its toll on you

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:04.549
But eating healthy can still taste good and it'll even save you money

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:07.280
You might actually start enjoying vegetables!

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.400
Guess your mom was always right

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:17.880
But now that you're cooking,

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:18.520
working out,

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:19.740
and starting a new job,

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:24.180
time becomes more valuable so you start setting a schedule and sticking to it

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:28.460
No more flaking, you make time for work, your friends and most importantly...

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:31.110
...your family

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:44.309
Don't worry, you can also set aside time, to do nothing

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:49.260
Utimately, you start to see how important it is to plan things out

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:50.400
"Hey, Drew!"

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:51.239
"Hey!"

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:53.460
"What are you doing here man?"

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:54.660
"What's up Carl, hey Jen!

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:56.700
Just hanging out, what about you?"

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:58.919
"My friend wanted to try this cafe, this is Nancy"

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:00.420
"Hi I'm-"

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:01.540
"Drew!"

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:04.500
"Yeah, we actually used to work on the same floor!"

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:05.099
"Really?"

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:07.200
"Wait, are you...?"

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:08.340
"Yep!"

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:11.840
"I spilled coffee on this guy the day he got hired."

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:15.300
"Wow, small world!"

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:18.300
And that some things, you never see coming

00:06:29.699 --> 00:06:30.940
But first...

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:33.360
...you gotta learn car maintenance

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:36.140
"Cars have gaskets?"

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:40.319
and...

00:06:40.319 --> 00:06:41.820
...house maintenance

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:43.218
"Sinks have gaskets?"

00:06:44.279 --> 00:06:47.580
You're independent in so many other aspects of your life

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:49.040
You should be able to fix a sink!

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:51.460
"Uh-oh."

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:54.020
Or at least know who to call to do it right

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:56.100
The trained professional tells you that it's better

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:59.980
to buy a more expensive gasket, than replacing a cheap one three times

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:02.280
Quality has meaning now

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:04.100
So you start looking around your apartment!

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:06.980
What else should you invest in?

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:08.380
Better furniture,

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:10.720
better cookware,

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:12.340
better...

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:15.660
You can't help but chuckle

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:19.540
With all the upgrades you've made in your life, and all the adulting you've done

00:07:20.189 --> 00:07:22.189
there's one thing you almost forgot about!

00:07:26.069 --> 00:07:28.069
It's the same one Charlie had

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:31.129
You almost forgot about him and all his '-eurs'

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:34.540
You almost forgot about the build statements,

00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:35.840
countless interviews,

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:37.140
number of squats,

00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:39.080
and faulty faucets that led you here

00:07:39.599 --> 00:07:41.599
Because you realize becoming an adult...

00:07:42.029 --> 00:07:46.489
isn't about eating kale or making a lot of money or buying new clothes

00:07:47.699 --> 00:07:50.980
Becoming an adult is about taking control of your life

00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:52.960
and living up to your full potential

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:55.400
"Hey! Ready to go hun?"

00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:57.620
"Oh, uh... yeah!"

00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:27.420
Hey everyone! Hope you guys enjoyed that

00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:30.900
Adulting is a topic that we've been wanting to make a video about for a very long time

00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:34.080
because it's something everyone goes through at some point in their lives

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:37.700
and yeah, there's not one correct way to go about it so we hope this video gave you an idea

00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:39.660
of maybe how you might approach adulting

00:08:39.660 --> 00:08:41.300
