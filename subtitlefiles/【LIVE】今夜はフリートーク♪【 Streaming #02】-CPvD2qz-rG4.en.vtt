00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.110
Can you see me?

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:49.430
Yahoo!

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:50.530
You can see me?

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.830
Yay!

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:52.850
Good evening

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:54.380

Hello!

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:57.720
Oh, amazing

Thanks for always leaving so many comments!

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:01.780
Good evening

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:02.370
Hello

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:03.110
Hello

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:05.290
Ohh, amazing

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:06.350
I'll do my best, I'll do my best

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.430
I'll read the comments, good evening-

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:09.330
Hey, hey

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.000
Yahoo

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:11.800
Well, everyone

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:12.890
To start off...

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.500
I have a lot to apologise for

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.420
Today, I was supposed to

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:18.760
Have a Avabel Online...

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.760
Livestream, but...

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:23.800
There were various...

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.340
Things that didn't go well

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:26.330
I'll be doing it

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.140
Next time

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.500
I’m really sorry!

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.040
But when my live broadcast...

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:33.460
When my live stream finishes...

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:34.690
When everything calms down...

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:36.070
I plan to play Avabel Online

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:37.780
So anyone who wants to play Avabel Online

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:38.930
Let's play together!

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:40.080
I look forward to it!

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:42.370
Well, today-

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.510
How long can I livestream for? Probably...

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:47.300
Around 10 minutes?

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:48.500
I guess?

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.180
Around 15 minutes

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:51.650
I think I can do that

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:53.160
Well, today I was supposed...

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:54.940
I thought I was going to play Avabel, but...

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:56.120
I have no plans now

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:57.190
Completely...

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:59.270
Completely no plans...

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:00.820
I think it would be fun

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.110
To chat with everyone

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:03.880
I think so!

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:06.190
I'll be in your care~

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:07.310
Yay!

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:08.650
There are a lot of peace signs

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:09.280
Lots

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:10.340
You can see me?

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:11.530

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.090

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:37.320

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.510

Ah
Is this someone writing Korean text?

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.050
“AI-chan, I love you”, thank you!

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:54.500

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:55.690

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:00.780
Umm… you know

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:01.940
I have something to ask-

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:04.180
Something to ask to everyone

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:05.220
Question?

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.330
I want someone to teach me

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:08.440
Recently

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.830
I haven't been watching anime

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:13.160
I haven't been watching anime

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:14.330
So for this season-

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:15.660
For the current anime

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:16.680
Do you have any...

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:18.930
Anime that...

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:20.010
You recommend?

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:22.630
I haven't seen anything

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:23.540
So I have no idea

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.310
Is there anime that is popular overseas?

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:27.690
Good morning

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:28.610
Good morning

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:34.740
The white girl

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:35.830
The white girl- haha!

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:37.610
It's the white girl, right?

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:39.550
Saekano!

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:40.550

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:44.160

You are my lovely friends!

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:24.550
Am I wrong?

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:25.590
Am I wrong?

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:26.520
I’m not

My Hero Academia

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:40.750
I haven't seen the new season yet, it's pretty interesting overall

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:41.480
I know

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:44.540
An anime called Creators?

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:46.810
I'll watch HeroAca 
(Hero Academia)

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:48.130

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:10.880
What does that mean?

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:12.910
Someone translate that for me

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:14.480

Love you… well...

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:20.550
I know what ‘love you’ means!

“From...

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:27.770

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:29.170
Nice to meet you! Thank you!

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:29.660

As expected everyone likes Your Name?

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:57.590
Sakura Quest, I think I have heard of that

00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:57.930

Thank you for so many!

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:08.310
If I can't read them all, I’m sorry

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:09.980
I've watched Jojo's Adventures

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:12.350
I don't know much about the manga

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:14.060
I’ve seen the anime though

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:16.640
It's up to part four, right?

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:18.090
Right?

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:23.840
Right?

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:26.130
Danganronpa!

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:27.260
Umm...

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:28.860
The first people that were killed

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:30.140
I have seen

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:31.740
First- what?

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:33.270
What do I mean the first people that were killed-

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:35.490
The first people that were there, umm...

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:38.180
In Side: Despair and Hope

Ah-

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:40.950
From Korea!

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:41.740
Thank you!

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:42.501
Ah!
It's that one

00:06:42.501 --> 00:06:43.881
In your icon! It's that one

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:46.470
Uzuki-chan from Cinderella Girls!

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:49.180
What did they write?

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:50.700
“Leon-san”, thank you!

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:52.500

00:06:57.810 --> 00:06:59.100
Thank you anyway!

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:01.860
“Love” is written then so it's love, right?

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:02.700
Thank you!

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:06.920
Surely that doesn’t count as this season

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:09.350
One Piece is quite long, right?

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:10.550
It's interesting

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:11.920
It's interesting, but...

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:12.970
It's like...

00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:13.980
Endless

00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:14.790
Endless

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:18.110
Rise of Bahamut, is that right?

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:20.020
A game?

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:22.330
It's Shadowverse's...

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:23.660
Expansion, right?

00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:25.860
Hi, hi~

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:27.670

“Hello AI-chan”!

00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:36.490
Hello!

00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:40.560
What did they write? What?

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:42.810
Ah
I’ve seen Stein;s Gate!

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:43.930
I have!

00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:47.040
Wait, if I click this comment

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:48.820
And I pick up that comment-

00:07:49.590 --> 00:07:50.540
That doesn't work

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:52.220
That doesn't work

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:54.900
It's not stopping

00:07:55.929 --> 00:07:57.829
If I don't immediately see it

00:07:57.830 --> 00:07:59.420
It will flow on and disappear

00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:01.170
“I love you, AI-chan”, thank you!

00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:01.780

Ah, ah, ah, ah-

00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:11.350
You know-

00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:12.100
Umm...

00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:13.100
The long comments-

00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:14.410
I've seen One Punch Man

00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:16.820
Long comments are...

00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:18.240
Hard to read

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:20.810
If it's possible, then everyone

00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:23.570
Just use a single sentence, and I will be happy

00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:25.330
Just use a single sentence

00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:26.470
I might be able to handle it

00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:28.830
“From Denmark

From different countries watching, thank you!

00:09:15.170 --> 00:09:16.290
By the way...

00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:17.180
My...

00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:18.860
Personal recommendation

00:09:19.610 --> 00:09:20.940
For anime...

00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:24.090
I've mentioned this in a bunch of my videos already, but...

00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:25.760
Nagi no Asu Kara: A Lull in the Sea

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:26.580
And also...

00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:28.940
The ‘From The New World’!

00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:30.220
I've mentioned a lot

00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:30.770
Probably

00:09:30.770 --> 00:09:32.290
If you look into it...

00:09:32.290 --> 00:09:33.720
It’s an anime from

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:36.450
Three or four years ago

00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:37.740
Also...

00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:39.050
What was it…?

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:42.280
The most recent ones I've watched...

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:45.790
What are they…?

00:09:47.090 --> 00:09:47.990
What are they…?

00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:49.830
Well...

00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:51.740
There are a lot of them

00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:53.170
So they’re not coming to mind!

00:09:53.170 --> 00:09:54.090
Hahaha

00:09:54.850 --> 00:09:55.750
But, you know...

00:09:55.750 --> 00:09:57.400

00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:01.550
Love Live

00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:03.750
But Love Live is-

00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:06.900
It's that, um...

00:10:08.110 --> 00:10:09.040
Um...

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:09.750
Hm...

00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:10.780
There’s a second season coming

00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:11.490
I have good expectations for the second season

00:13:02.830 --> 00:13:03.830
Umm...

00:13:04.370 --> 00:13:06.060
The ones I listen to recently-

00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:07.440
The songs I listen to are by

00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:09.110

Something- Taiiku-san

00:13:18.670 --> 00:13:19.470
It's like...

♪ The animals ♪

00:13:21.630 --> 00:13:23.360
♪ Run pa pa ♪

00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:25.080
They sing something like that

00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:26.230
I listen to that!

00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:29.570
Also, there is-

00:13:29.570 --> 00:13:31.080
I listen to CHANMINA, CHANMINA!

00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:32.560
I don't listen to CHANMINA?

00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:34.430
I don't listen to her but she is cute!

00:13:34.430 --> 00:13:35.650

00:13:46.490 --> 00:13:47.510
Thank you!

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:49.710
How do I read this?

00:14:02.140 --> 00:14:03.820
What does that mean?

00:14:03.820 --> 00:14:05.090
I’m sorry, but thank you!

00:14:05.090 --> 00:14:06.110
I'll do my best

00:14:06.110 --> 00:14:07.900
To improve my English!

00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:09.280
Really!

00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:10.940
Does anyone...

00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:13.570
Know of a good way to study English?

00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:14.970
Does anyone know?

00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:17.970
“Fiora-san”

00:14:17.970 --> 00:14:19.430
Fiora-san, thank you!

00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:21.110
“Mother-

00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:28.390
Ah!

00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:31.520
Only 5 minutes left

00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:33.150
Only 5 minutes left!

00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:34.490
Now then-

00:14:34.490 --> 00:14:35.350
Ah, that’s right!

00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:36.220
That’s right!

00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:38.150
I wanted to do something today

00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:39.630
“I love you”

00:14:39.630 --> 00:14:41.710
Thank you, person from Finland!

00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:43.130
“Please

Con-

00:14:44.190 --> 00:14:45.670

00:14:45.670 --> 00:14:46.420
World

00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:47.260
World!

00:14:49.010 --> 00:14:49.870
World

00:14:49.870 --> 00:14:50.530
World?

00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:53.480
Ah- that's right… what was it…?

00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:54.850
What- I remember!

00:14:54.850 --> 00:14:55.720
It's that!

00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:59.140
I-I have something to consult with everyone

00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:01.260
To be honest...

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:01.970
You see...

00:15:01.970 --> 00:15:04.300
I am a Youtuber, but...

00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:05.980
I’m virtual, right?

00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:07.550
So...

00:15:07.550 --> 00:15:08.580
Just for a bit...

00:15:08.580 --> 00:15:10.250
When I think by myself...

00:15:10.649 --> 00:15:11.669
My video material

00:15:11.670 --> 00:15:12.780
Comes and...

00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:15.110
Goes...

00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:17.510
Or something along those lines...

00:15:17.510 --> 00:15:19.030
So if you are okay with this...

00:15:19.030 --> 00:15:19.690
If...

00:15:19.690 --> 00:15:22.220
You have any ideas for videos...

00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:23.730
Leave a comment here

00:15:23.730 --> 00:15:24.380
Um...

00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:25.120
Or on Twitter as well

00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:26.990
And go ahead and let me know!

00:15:26.990 --> 00:15:28.910
It's public planning, exactly!

00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:30.830
Exactly, exactly

00:15:30.830 --> 00:15:32.540
“You are important to me”, thank you!

00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:34.880
World domination! I would like to do that, dominate the world!

00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:36.330
Yes, I want more video material!

00:15:36.330 --> 00:15:37.530
I want more video material!

00:15:38.190 --> 00:15:40.870
I do my best to think of stuff everyday, but

00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:43.820
I think about it… but...

00:15:45.690 --> 00:15:46.290
Right?

00:15:47.060 --> 00:15:47.810
You know?

00:15:47.810 --> 00:15:48.940
Actually it's like...

00:15:48.940 --> 00:15:50.260
I call myself a genius

00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:52.920
I call myself a super A.I

00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:54.040
But it's actually...

00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:55.200
My head is a bit...

00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:56.460
like that, you know?

00:15:56.460 --> 00:15:57.050
Haha!

00:15:57.360 --> 00:15:57.940
Just a bit!

00:15:58.660 --> 00:15:59.200
“Not-

00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:00.630
from Nottingham”!

00:16:00.630 --> 00:16:02.530
From Nottingham, thank you!

00:16:02.530 --> 00:16:04.120
“AI-chan is amazing”

00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:05.930
Thank you, really!

00:16:08.110 --> 00:16:10.020
Video material is like that, like...

00:16:10.020 --> 00:16:12.290
It's expected of me, since I’m me

00:16:12.290 --> 00:16:14.900
There are things that I can do

00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:17.110
For normal YouTubers

00:16:17.110 --> 00:16:18.670
What they do and their material

00:16:18.670 --> 00:16:19.810
I can't really

00:16:19.810 --> 00:16:20.520
Plagiarize-

00:16:20.930 --> 00:16:22.830
I can't make a homage to them-

00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:24.260
Isn't that right?

00:16:24.650 --> 00:16:25.420
Yes, yes

00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:26.090
It's like that so

00:16:26.090 --> 00:16:27.410
I can't do the same thing

00:16:27.410 --> 00:16:28.640
“How about singing?”

00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:29.340
Oh yeah

00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:31.800
I would like to sing, I like singing songs

00:16:32.630 --> 00:16:34.240
I like singing songs

00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:35.610
“From Indonesia”, thank you

00:16:35.610 --> 00:16:36.790
"Kuzu no Honkai"

00:16:36.790 --> 00:16:37.350
"Ku-"

00:16:37.350 --> 00:16:38.140
“Sing”

00:16:38.450 --> 00:16:40.380
Does that mean you want me to sing?

00:16:41.871 --> 00:16:43.481
Ah, by the way

00:16:43.490 --> 00:16:46.060
The video I put out about my short comic play

00:16:46.060 --> 00:16:46.720
Did you see it?

00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:47.640
How was it?

00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:49.850
How was it, how was it?

00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:52.620
“Please play around in the live”

00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:53.650
“Please”

00:16:53.650 --> 00:16:54.450
“Fin-

00:16:54.450 --> 00:16:56.620

Ah-

00:16:59.830 --> 00:17:01.590
Ah, Inside, the live one

00:17:01.590 --> 00:17:02.640
I see, I see

00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:03.870
“I'm from…”

00:17:03.870 --> 00:17:04.570
“Taiwan”

00:17:04.570 --> 00:17:05.280
“I love you”

00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:06.530
Thank you very much

00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:07.540
Was that correct?

00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:09.590
English bands

00:17:09.590 --> 00:17:11.490
English bands

00:17:11.490 --> 00:17:12.530
What are they…?

00:17:12.530 --> 00:17:13.470
I...

00:17:13.470 --> 00:17:15.790
I listen to a lot of them

00:17:15.790 --> 00:17:16.950
I'll write them down

00:17:16.950 --> 00:17:17.740
Thank you

00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:20.850
People from Taiwan

00:17:20.850 --> 00:17:22.240
Thank you, BanG Dream!

00:17:22.610 --> 00:17:23.100
You know

00:17:23.100 --> 00:17:25.100
There is an app for BanG Dream!

00:17:25.580 --> 00:17:25.900
Oh-

00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:28.170
Thanks for the recommendations

00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:31.710
“I am”

00:17:31.710 --> 00:17:33.380
“Not that good at English”

00:17:33.690 --> 00:17:35.570
“My apologies”

00:17:35.570 --> 00:17:38.040
“I am always on your Twitter”

00:17:38.430 --> 00:17:40.320
“When you watch my videos”

00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:43.290
“When you return to me”

00:17:43.290 --> 00:17:45.700
“You alway make me laugh and smile”

00:17:45.700 --> 00:17:46.720
Oh, that's good

00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:48.010
Are you smiling now?

00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:49.420
“So I am”

00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:50.800
“Really happy about it”

00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:52.220
“Thank you very much, Kizuna”

00:17:52.220 --> 00:17:52.600
Oh-

00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:54.030
The same to you, thank you

00:17:54.030 --> 00:17:55.770
If everyone can be happy

00:17:55.770 --> 00:17:57.870
I'll be really happy, thank you

00:17:59.130 --> 00:18:00.400
“My heart”

00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:01.940
“My heart is always”

00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:03.390
“Feeling like it's going to explode”

00:18:03.390 --> 00:18:03.940
Ah-

00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:05.150
I see, thank you

00:18:05.150 --> 00:18:07.360
For translating for me

00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:08.670
Thank you really

00:18:10.050 --> 00:18:11.390
“From China”

00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:12.270
“Bibi”

00:18:12.270 --> 00:18:13.310
“Electrifying”

00:18:13.310 --> 00:18:14.080
“Place”

00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:14.490
Ah

00:18:14.490 --> 00:18:16.230
Thank you very much

00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:18.880
“Thank you for making…”

00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:19.580
“Amazing…”

00:18:19.580 --> 00:18:20.600
“Amazing video”

00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:22.970
“Senpai”
(TL: senior)

00:18:22.970 --> 00:18:23.600
“I love you”

00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:23.960
Ah

00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:25.610
I wonder if they like embarrassed people

00:18:25.610 --> 00:18:26.510
Thank you

00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:29.440
“Sing for us”

00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:30.210
But you know

00:18:30.210 --> 00:18:30.750
Umm...

00:18:30.750 --> 00:18:32.730
The people who dance

00:18:32.730 --> 00:18:33.430
Ah, but-

00:18:33.430 --> 00:18:35.770
A video where I sing and dance

00:18:36.279 --> 00:18:37.870
I've give you one next time

00:18:37.870 --> 00:18:39.220
Please look forward to it

00:18:40.170 --> 00:18:41.610
It's not my first?

00:18:41.610 --> 00:18:42.920
My first? I don't know

00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:43.410
Ah, but-

00:18:43.410 --> 00:18:44.540
Dancing like this

00:18:44.540 --> 00:18:47.210
There currently isn't many of them, dancing

00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:51.020
They might let me dance poorly

00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:52.450
“Can you go out with me?”

00:18:52.450 --> 00:18:53.630
Inside your heart~

00:18:53.630 --> 00:18:54.800
Inside your heart~

00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:55.590
We will go out~

00:18:56.110 --> 00:18:58.540
“Do you know the song”

00:18:58.540 --> 00:18:59.370
“Him”

00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:00.620
“Hym hym?”

00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:02.180
“Hym hym?”

00:19:02.710 --> 00:19:03.790
“If so…”

00:19:03.790 --> 00:19:06.660
“Can you sing it for us?”

00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:07.410
What does that mean?

00:19:07.410 --> 00:19:09.430
Can you sing a song for us?

00:19:09.430 --> 00:19:10.310
Is what they are asking?

00:19:12.170 --> 00:19:13.230
By the way, everyone

00:19:13.230 --> 00:19:14.180
For me

00:19:14.590 --> 00:19:16.680
For singing and dancing

00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:18.680
Do you have any songs you want

00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:20.030
To request?

00:19:20.030 --> 00:19:21.270
For future reference

00:19:21.670 --> 00:19:23.320
If you do please, let me know

00:19:23.990 --> 00:19:25.840
Person from Korea? Thank you

00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:26.690
Sorry

00:19:26.690 --> 00:19:27.680
I can't read that

00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:29.640
Thank you, the glasses thing

00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:31.410
The person with the Wii looking avatar

00:19:31.410 --> 00:19:32.800
Thank you, hello

00:19:34.460 --> 00:19:35.710
Thank you

00:19:35.710 --> 00:19:36.410
Ah-

00:19:36.410 --> 00:19:38.590
The time, that went by fast

00:19:39.890 --> 00:19:41.210
“Hare Hare Yukai”

00:19:41.210 --> 00:19:42.060
Sounds-

00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:43.560
I might be able to do that

00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:45.850
I tried the Koi dance before once, but-

00:19:45.850 --> 00:19:47.070
It's probably

00:19:47.070 --> 00:19:49.680
Reasonably difficult to do it

00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:50.600
How is that?

00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:52.560
Love Live sounds good

00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:53.490
Thank you

00:19:53.490 --> 00:19:55.650
I'll probably read the comments while I'm still logged in

00:19:55.650 --> 00:19:56.980
I'll take my time going through them

00:19:56.980 --> 00:19:58.300
Thank you really, everyone!

00:19:58.300 --> 00:20:00.000
Sorry, it's time

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:00.630
See you-

00:20:00.630 --> 00:20:02.010
Probably next week

00:20:02.010 --> 00:20:04.170
I might not be able to do it though

00:20:04.170 --> 00:20:04.750
Until next time

00:20:04.750 --> 00:20:06.770
Thank you for watching

00:20:07.820 --> 00:20:09.040
Thank you

00:20:09.370 --> 00:20:10.040
See you later

00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:11.210
I'll be waiting for next time

00:20:11.540 --> 00:20:12.520
Bye bye

00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:13.320
Was really fun

00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:13.910
Thank you

00:20:13.910 --> 00:20:14.720
Bye bye

00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:23.660
