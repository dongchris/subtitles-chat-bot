00:00:00.467 --> 00:00:02.969
Hello, everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna AI here!

00:00:02.969 --> 00:00:05.872
I think plenty of people already know this, but

00:00:05.872 --> 00:00:07.273
on the 16th of March (Fri),

00:00:07.273 --> 00:00:07.907
my

00:00:07.907 --> 00:00:08.808
first photo album

00:00:08.808 --> 00:00:12.445
is going to be released for sale! Yay~!

00:00:12.445 --> 00:00:13.113
So!

00:00:13.113 --> 00:00:15.081
The marketing demon, Kizuna AI,

00:00:15.081 --> 00:00:16.683
will be giving advice about

00:00:16.683 --> 00:00:18.184
how to sell this photo album to

00:00:18.184 --> 00:00:19.185
the bookstore staff

00:00:19.185 --> 00:00:20.320
all across Japan!

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.422
Please sell my book!

00:00:22.422 --> 00:00:23.423
I’m counting on you!

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:24.360
Getting right into it,

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.040
sell the Kizuna AI’s photo album just like this!

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:28.480
Yeah, like this~!

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:28.980
First of all!

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.620
Make sure you display the books face up!

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:31.200
Second!

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:35.480
Please divide them into the culture, art, and academic genre sections!

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:36.320
Third!

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.000
Make them draw your eye with a POP!

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.140
"What on earth should I do to make them draw someone's eye?"

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:42.780
you there thought!

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:43.780
Yes, you!

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:44.560
Might as well tell you!

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:46.880
In this video, Kizuna AI, herself will show you

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.900
the way of sales promotion POP!

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:49.740
This is very special!

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:51.500
This is actually gonna cost me, y'know?!

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:52.960
A.I.Channel

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.120
[ This seems fake,

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.100
they're selling so fast ]
(Reference: “Touch” manga)

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.300
I want to try my best so you're able to say things like that!

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.958
Take that, Nagahama Neru-chan!

00:00:58.958 --> 00:00:59.559
Just kidding

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:02.295
[ Please tell people, “I was watching A.I.Channel” at the register ]

00:01:02.295 --> 00:01:03.196
The employees will say

00:01:03.196 --> 00:01:04.364
“Ah,

00:01:04.364 --> 00:01:05.498
I’ve seen her too!”

00:01:05.498 --> 00:01:06.166
Probably?

00:01:06.166 --> 00:01:07.734
[ Fully-naked ban ]

00:01:07.734 --> 00:01:08.435
No!

00:01:08.435 --> 00:01:09.736
I’m not lying!

00:01:09.736 --> 00:01:12.639
[ 2D…? No, she’s real! ]

00:01:12.639 --> 00:01:13.306
I...

00:01:13.306 --> 00:01:14.741
do exist, after all!

00:01:14.741 --> 00:01:18.445
[ Can’t decide whether to buy it or not? What a waste of a second! Just buy it! ]

00:01:18.445 --> 00:01:20.046
Even if you regret buying it,

00:01:20.046 --> 00:01:21.948
we don’t accept returns!

00:01:21.948 --> 00:01:22.880
[ I’m sorry.

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.217
Truly. ]

00:01:24.217 --> 00:01:26.052
You think I’m just joking around, huh?

00:01:26.052 --> 00:01:27.053
I’m serious!

00:01:27.053 --> 00:01:29.856
[ Hello, thank you for your purchase! ]

00:01:29.856 --> 00:01:30.824
Huh?

00:01:30.824 --> 00:01:31.691
You’ll buy it, right?

00:01:32.092 --> 00:01:32.859
So, how was it?

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:34.594
Will this be valuable to you?

00:01:34.594 --> 00:01:35.261
Mmm! Mmm!

00:01:35.261 --> 00:01:36.262
Isn’t that right?

00:01:36.262 --> 00:01:37.030
Ahhh!

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:38.164
Now you’ll be selling

00:01:38.164 --> 00:01:39.599
my photo albums like crazy~

00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:41.167
I want to film a video

00:01:41.167 --> 00:01:43.002
Like an assault against the people buying them too!

00:01:43.002 --> 00:01:44.204
Someone please...

00:01:44.204 --> 00:01:46.372
get me out of here!

00:01:46.372 --> 00:01:46.873
Also,

00:01:46.873 --> 00:01:48.808
everyone please buy my photo album!

00:01:48.808 --> 00:01:49.709
Please!

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:50.410
Ah!

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.910
This...

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:52.579
isn’t a book of illustrations.

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:54.247
It’s a photo album!

00:01:54.247 --> 00:01:54.714
So

00:01:54.714 --> 00:01:57.150
please put it into the photo album section as well!

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:59.652
This was Virtual YouTuber Kizuna AI!

00:01:59.652 --> 00:02:00.750
