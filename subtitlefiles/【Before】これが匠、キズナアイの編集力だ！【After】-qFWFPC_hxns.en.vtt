00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:02.902
Hello everyone! Virtual Youtuber Kizuna AI here!

00:00:02.902 --> 00:00:03.470
Everyone!

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:04.900
For YouTubers,

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:07.540
do you know what’s the most important thing?

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:08.508
Yes!

00:00:08.508 --> 00:00:09.509
It’s editing!

00:00:09.509 --> 00:00:11.811
Recently, I’ve recorded a bunch of videos

00:00:11.811 --> 00:00:14.047
and wondered while editing

00:00:14.047 --> 00:00:17.417
No matter what the videos are, we can get by with editing!

00:00:17.417 --> 00:00:18.418
So today!

00:00:18.418 --> 00:00:22.080
I'll be filming a video that you might think

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.491
"Eh? That's not really interesting"

00:00:24.491 --> 00:00:26.659
And show you the power of editing!

00:00:26.659 --> 00:00:28.795
Without further ado, let’s do it!

00:00:28.795 --> 00:00:30.597
A.I.Channel!

00:00:30.597 --> 00:00:31.498
Transmission!

00:00:31.498 --> 00:00:32.932
[This material will be used for editing]

00:00:32.932 --> 00:00:34.934
Recent obsession!

00:00:34.934 --> 00:00:35.980
Recently

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:37.937
I’ve been really into writing reviews for food!

00:00:37.937 --> 00:00:38.437
Eh?

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.808
You said, "You can't eat if you're virtual, right?"

00:00:41.808 --> 00:00:43.540
Well, you’re right-

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:44.144
But!

00:00:44.144 --> 00:00:46.584
I really want to make a food review!♪

00:00:46.585 --> 00:00:47.147
and

00:00:47.147 --> 00:00:49.616
Like, “I really want you to advertise our ramen”

00:00:49.616 --> 00:00:52.786
I think people will definitely have these requests for me

00:00:52.786 --> 00:00:53.590
So-

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:54.470
for that reason

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:57.023
I studied a lot of videos

00:00:57.023 --> 00:00:57.791
"You are so clever!"

00:00:57.791 --> 00:00:58.425
Sort of feeling

00:00:58.425 --> 00:00:58.950
Eh-

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:00.427
You want to see it?

00:01:00.427 --> 00:01:01.861
It can't be helped then-

00:01:01.861 --> 00:01:04.100
I was planning to keep it secret

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.199
but if everyone is so eager to see them

00:01:06.199 --> 00:01:07.400
I'll show you

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.803
"Eating something really delicious"

00:01:09.803 --> 00:01:10.530
"Ahm"

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:11.570
"mmm"

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:12.520
"mmm"

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:13.910
"mmm~"

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.570
What is this deliciousness?

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:18.670
My cheeks are going to fall off

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:20.480
Delicious~

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.348
"When eating something spicy"

00:01:22.348 --> 00:01:23.570
"Ahm"

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:24.440
"mmm"

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.090
"mmmmmmmmm"

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:28.100
"Uuu"

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:29.080
*cough cough*

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.350
Sp-spicy!

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.980
Spicy spicy spicy!

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:33.840

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.929
Please give me water! Water!

"Commercial for drinking a certain popular drink"

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:43.590
You want some?

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:45.700
Give your body peace~

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:46.773
Calpis

00:01:46.773 --> 00:01:47.790
So-

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.810
Something completely unrelated

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:50.820
Umm...

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.579
Can we talk about something that is completely unrelated?

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:54.840
The recently broadcasted

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.282
[Can't you write Keyaki with Kanji?]

00:01:56.282 --> 00:01:58.010
Their recent single,

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:59.018
like this,

00:01:59.018 --> 00:02:01.700
Keyaki were handing it out to their favorite entertainers

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.810
They were giving it away to famous people

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.326
They were giving it out to a couple of people but-

00:02:06.326 --> 00:02:07.060
I-

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:08.650
wasn't on the show

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:09.140
Eh-

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.870
Compared to everyone else that appeared on the show

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.610
I am the most confident that I like them

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:15.930
more than anyone

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.538
But I wasn't chosen!

00:02:18.538 --> 00:02:20.106
That is all for material footage!

00:02:20.106 --> 00:02:22.675
So with this nonsensical continuation

00:02:22.675 --> 00:02:24.410
with this video I pulled from a while ago

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.010
