00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:02.180
Bing!

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:07.720
I know I kind of rushed through it, but that's the basic idea.

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:08.840
What do you guys think?

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:10.440
I mean it sounds amazing, Ted.

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:12.700
I..I think we're just trying to process what you're saying.

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:14.540
Are, are you sure you want to do this?

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:15.100
Definitely.

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:16.440
When we started Awkward Animals

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:18.540
We didn't know how big the brand would become.

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:21.940
We made a few animals like the turtle, the panda, and the giraffe

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:23.940
But now it's time to think BIGGER

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.400
[Gasp] Like a cow??

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:26.500
We have a cow...

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:27.740
Like a bigger cow?

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:30.000
Do you really think this trip is gonna help?

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:31.620
It's more than just a trip.

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:35.060
It's an epic global safari of

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.120
AWESOME AWKWARDNESS

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.720
[Whispers] Das tiiiiight

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.100
Wait, so let me recap here

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.120
You wanna take some time away from the office to go travel around the world looking for

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.600
Real-life inspirations of new awkward animal plush toys that we can make?

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:49.360
Bingo.

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.060
Look, if you guys have any other questions, I'll be happy to answer them.

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:55.160
What d'you think you'll find?

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.320
Whatever finds me.

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:57.480
How long will you be gone?

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.280
However long it takes.

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:00.720
Where do you think you'll go first?

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.360
Where.. ever I think of first

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:05.142
You, you sure you don't need help?

00:01:05.142 --> 00:01:06.838
Like, do you want us to go with you?

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.349
As much as I would like that, you guys have to hold down the fort.

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.479
Christine, you're our lead producer. So you have to make sure everything runs smoothly.

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.920
Taylor, everything needs to be edited. So keep up the great work.

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.820
Pfft thanks.

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:23.940
Wes and Phil...

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:25.980
Yeah.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.160
I don't know what to say, Ted. I mean we'll try our best.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:29.969
You guys will be fine.

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:33.659
But I gotta go start packing. I'll check in whenever I can.

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.240
This is my safari hat.

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.540
-Bye Ted! 
-Be safe!! 
-Bye, good luck!

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:39.920
Wong Fu for life (I MISS TED SO MUCHHH)

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:42.440
Oh, wow.

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.880
Hey, guys, let's not look at this as a bad thing, right?

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:47.520
I mean, a lot of good can come out of this.

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.120
We can implement a lot of new strategies.

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.620
Right?

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:50.120
So

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.620
I mean..

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:51.300
Look...

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.320
What do we need more of, guys?

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:55.840
Let's just spit ball.

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.000
Ummmm.. Higher production value?

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:00.500
Absolutely.

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.340
Anything else?

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.820
Staying under budget.

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:05.380
You know I'm all about efficiency.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.500
Let's challenge ourselves.

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.680
Dude, exactly. Nothing is impossible.

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.040
If we can do all these things, it can only lead to one thing...

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.360
...success!

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:17.240
So say it all together with me, guys!

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:18.500
Wong Fu needs more...?

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.400
Peeeen.......

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.040
Pens. We need, we need more.. pens. (Phil's face though)

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:32.040
Whiteboard pens.

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.000
Uh, on it.

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:34.120
Yeah.

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.780
[Laughing]

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:43.080
[Mumbling]

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.340
-Take it back, tack it back. Is that mine, did I mess up?
-Yeah, take it back.

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:46.660
-No, n, no 
-No, it was me..

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:48.720
Let's challenge ourselves.

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.020
I'm down with that - nothing's impossible.

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:52.420
I looked at the camera too..

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.280
Das tiiight

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:57.580
Das tiiight

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.620
[Gasp] Das tiiight

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.040
Can we take it back please?

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.280
Don't leave me with them.

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.640
Boop!

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:10.280
I keep messing up this line.

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:15.080
Hey guys! We hope you liked that first episode of this brand new series that we're starting.

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:16.040
It's called "Offline".

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:22.560
And it's basically little skits about our office life that's inspired by our real office life.

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:26.660
-Kinda.. It's really.. It's real. 
-But not.. But it's real. 
-Yeah.

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:32.320
But come back every Tuesday 'cause we'll be posting up new episodes and we wanna share the fun with you!

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:37.320
Yup. So tell your friends to watch "Offline". Well, tell them to watch it online. It's...

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:38.100
Well, online.

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.500
It's called "Offline", but it, it will be online..

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.180
We did not think about this title...

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.500
So in this episode, we were trying to figure out "What does Wong Fu need more of?"

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:47.520
So actually now we want to ask you.

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:49.880
What do you think guys Wong Fu needs more of? Leave a comment below.

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:54.800
And then we'll pick a winner, and then you'll get an awkward animal from Ted's awesome safari.

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:55.340
Yup!

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.720
And don't write... "penis"... because that's just inappropriate.

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:01.160
-And we already know that. We... 
-You mean pe-ns...

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:02.700
-...we figured that out already 
-...pens!
