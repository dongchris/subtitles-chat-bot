00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:20.340
There comes a time when every nice guy
reaches a crossroad. After living his whole

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.890
life trying to treat everyone with
care and kindness, he realizes it got him

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:31.800
nothing in return. In fact it actually
resulted in the one person he truly

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:42.090
cared about thinking he's an asshole. So
here I am at the crossroad. If nice got

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.820
me nowhere and I'm already an asshole in Audrey's eyes, maybe I should just be exactly what

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.170
she thinks I am.
Besides what do I have to lose?

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.300
Forget being nice, I might

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:01.640
I might even- I might even get more

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.500
That's really nice of you. Thanks.

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:21.960
Damnit.

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.420
I got to your tacos with extra pico de "nice guy-o".

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.070
I'm seriously gonna punch you.
You should call them. Ask if they got home okay.

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.360
I'm sure they're fine.

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.920
You wanna talk about it?
There's nothing to talk about. She doesn't have

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:43.320
any feelings for me it's over.

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.160
She hates you. Hate's a feeling.

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:51.860
I just, wish I knew why.
Well... you talked behind her back.

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.800
You acted really immature, got SUPER drunk. Then you soft blocked her. You soft-blocks a girl?

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:58.628
You never soft-block a girl!

00:01:58.628 --> 00:02:01.680
Not why is she hates me.
Why she doesn't like me.

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.080
What difference does that make?

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.380
I don't know but if she's
going to be this angry at me I deserve to know

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:12.400
Oh my god
I can't take any more of this bitching!

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:19.670
Derek, I feel for you. I've been rejected too and
my mind would run a wild. Am I not

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.920
pretty enough? Am I not cool funny, smart
enough?

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:30.200
But ultimately I have to respect their decision. And most importantly myself!

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.260
She doesn't have to give you a reason why.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.560
If she's not into it she's not into it.

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:42.040
And even if you did know why, it's not gonna make you feel any better.

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:53.080
She's right. Sometimes, no one did anything wrong, it's just not there.

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:59.770
If that's the case, I wish I never said
anything. I wish I never listened all

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:04.150
those stupid videos telling me to risk
it all! Because now look, I lost

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:09.400
everything. My pride, Audrey, that
friendship. It just wasn't worth it.

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:14.960
Excuse me. Hello, excuse me.

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:19.690
Sorry were you having an inner monologue? 
Uhh, yeah sort of.

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:22.240
It's okay I do that too sometimes.

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:25.880
Anyways do
you have this in a medium I didn't see

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:32.920
any out there. 
Sure let me go check. Ok thanks.

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:54.180
It's HIM! The whole reason I'm in this crappy situation!

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.480
Excuse me, sorry we don't have that size. 
Ahh, okay no worries.

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.600
Actually is there anything I can help you about in particular with?

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:10.040
Nah, I'm just shopping around.

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:14.640
Mmm everyone's shopping for
something, am I right? Night out, new job

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:20.040
special event maybe? 
Uh yeah I'm just uh trying to find an outfit for a shoot.

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:24.560
A shoot? Coooool. What do you do?

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:28.840
Uh... hard to explain I guess I make videos

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:36.300
Ohh. Interesting! That is very interesting.
What about?

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:40.180
Uh I guess life, relationships

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:44.220
love. 
So you must consider yourself an
expert then?

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:46.860
Hardly I still have a lot to learn.

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:49.040
No shit.

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:51.960
What did you say? 
Hmm?

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:54.680
Did you say something? 
No. Did you?

00:04:54.680 --> 00:05:00.240
You just said-
No I didn't. Uh yeah I can help you right here.

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:25.840
You lied to me! 
Geezus!

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:30.680
What?!
You made that video! You said you were a nice guy and

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:34.520
you made that bullshit story where you
made a bullshit happy ending

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:38.880
you gave guys like me hope that nice
guys don't finish last!

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:45.009
Yes I think that's a good message don't you think?
Well it's not! It's not it's ruining live like mine!

00:05:45.009 --> 00:05:49.040
What's your name man? 
Derrick.

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:51.500
Derrick, I made that video 10 years ago to help

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:55.840
quote-unquote nice guys have a little
bit of courage and self-respect.

00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:00.320
And you got the girl! I did everything right and I still got screwed.

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:04.400
Screwed as in you didn't get the girl?
Yeah.

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:08.000
Well does she
at least want to stay friends?

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:14.480
After this past week? Doubtful, but either way I wouldn't want to.

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:17.520
Why not? 
Because it'd

00:06:17.539 --> 00:06:22.159
be awkward after I told her that I liked
her. Because I care about her so much

00:06:22.159 --> 00:06:27.680
that not being able to show her that
would drive me crazy. Because every time

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:34.120
I'm around her I would just be reminded
that, I wasn't good enough.

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:38.660
Man I'm really starting to feel that way
but that's really how you feel then you

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:42.560
got to move on without her. 
I tried- 
Without being an asshole.

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:46.400
If I move on that's it.

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:52.160
I- I lose. And everything you said in your
short was wrong okay nice guys DO finish last!

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:56.960
Here's the thing, Derek. When I made
that video I thought I was a nice guy

00:06:56.990 --> 00:07:00.380
too okay? And I was probably going
through the same frustrations that

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:03.800
you're going through right now
but over these last 10 years I've

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:09.680
learned a lot about what it means to be
nice. And truth is there's no such thing

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:15.320
as nice guys and nice girls. There are
only good decent people and these good

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:21.110
decent people sometimes get rejected and
they look for a reason because we're all

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:25.520
brought up wanting to believe that being
good will bring about good, but sometimes

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:30.480
life doesn't happen the way we want when
we want.

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:33.600
So why even try?

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:39.710
I don't know, I guess I still believe that good
things eventually will happen to good

00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:42.949
people. It's how you deal with all the sucky stuff in

00:07:42.949 --> 00:07:46.460
the meantime that will make all the
difference in your life. You can't really

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:51.040
say screw it all every time something
doesn't work out that's not really helping your future.

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:57.080
I know it's really hard, but try not to get jaded.

00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:00.979
Use this experience to make a better
version of yourself.

00:08:00.979 --> 00:08:04.800
And don't take it out on her in the
process.

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:06.640
[Cell phone buzz]

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:23.120
Whoa, he's gone!

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:25.200
What was that?

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:28.960
Huh? Oh nothing uh never mind.

00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:32.000
I mean you're on your phone so I decided to get in my car

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.100
Did you think I disappeared like a fairy godmother or something?

00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:40.440
What? No. Not at all
Okay well I'm gonna get in my car now.

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:41.500
Yeh yeh.

00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:44.280
Not disappearing
Okay, no I got it.

00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:45.620
Okay good luck, Derek. Thanks

00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:47.420
you too

00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:55.840
Alright.

00:09:55.840 --> 00:10:02.240
A little bit better please? No.
something else something else something

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:08.260
Oh yeah that's that's ok that's ok
but you know what this is this is the

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:10.800
last one let's let's see fierce!

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:16.480
No no no
no that's that's not fierce. I want intensity!

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:18.960
Um can we just smile?

00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:21.440
Sure you
could just smile if you'd like some

00:10:21.459 --> 00:10:24.940
basic ass graduation photos but I'm
trying to give you something that's

00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:27.449
going to get you likes! 
Damnit Jack just take the picture!

00:10:27.449 --> 00:10:29.240
I don't think we're on the same page creatively

00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:30.800
Take it! 
FINE!

00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:36.480
Was that so hard?
Yes it was and my vision's been compromised

00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:39.310
Your vision? What about your vision?

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:43.760
How can it be compromised you don't have a vision freaking Jack!

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:45.640
Audrey?

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:49.880
Derek. What are you doing here I saw a filthy

00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:55.080
I saw on Sophie's story that you guys went ahead with the shoot so I figured that maybe I could

00:10:55.080 --> 00:11:00.280
offer some help. 
That's nice- considerate of you.

00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:02.800
But we actually just finished.

00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:07.440
Oh. I see.

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:12.720
Actually, I had about 50 different
texts that I wanted to send you but I

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:18.000
figured we're good enough friends that I
could talk to you in person.

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:25.800
Are we? Good enough friends?  Last you told me seemed like you wanted nothing to do with me.

00:11:25.830 --> 00:11:32.120
Yeah that's what I want to talk about.
Okay.

00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:34.890
First I want to apologize.

00:11:34.890 --> 00:11:40.800
Everything I did since the night in the
car was wrong and uncalled for.

00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:44.200
Thanks for saying that.

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:47.290
The thing is I didn't communicate why I

00:11:47.290 --> 00:11:51.280
acted the way that I did.
What do you mean?

00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:52.640
You can understand how hard it is

00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:56.840
to still be friends after being rejected
that make sense right?

00:11:57.760 --> 00:11:59.840
I guess but it's

00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:05.530
not like I was forcing you to get my way
I just wanted to be hopeful that we

00:12:05.530 --> 00:12:10.840
could still be cool.
Don't worry, Audrey we will be cool okay?

00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:17.440
But being friends way we were is
something different. I think some people

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:23.960
could do it but I can't and that's just
because I like you too much.

00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:28.200
Too much to just be friends.

00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:30.520
I'm not trying to hold her friendship hostage

00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:33.910
and I'm not saying that I wasn't
being genuine when we were friends

00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:42.220
but it'd be too difficult to stay close
to you knowing that I wasn't enough, and

00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:44.840
some new guy will be.

00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:47.800
I understand.

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:52.920
So, I sorta came here to say goodbye.

00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:59.160
God that sounds so melodramatic but I think that

00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:04.080
this is where our friendship needs to
change. And not because I mad at you and I

00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:08.015
hope that you're not mad at me either.

00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:11.340
Of course I'm not mad at you Derek.

00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:18.300
I'm not perfect either. I'm still learning how to
handle these situations too and it sucks

00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:23.880
that it has to come to this but I
understand why.

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:28.120
And I respect your decision.
Thanks.

00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:34.900
I really appreciate you being so mature and talking to me like this.

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:38.960
See this is the guy I want to be friends with-

00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:42.640
Sorry, that's probably not what you wanna  hear right now

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:44.800
Yeah no.

00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:52.700
Do you think we can still be friends
later on?

00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:57.780
Maybe I hope I can get to a place where that's possible.

00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:00.100
That'd be cool.

00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:12.520
I'm sorry things didn't play out how do
you wanted.

00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:13.920
Don't be.

00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:16.680
It was still worth it.

00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:21.520
See you later, Audrey.

00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:22.840
See ya.

00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:29.600
So I know it looks like I'm walking away
all strong and resolved.

00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:34.600
And for a closing internal monologue that's what would be expected.

00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:37.560
But, no, I'm dying inside.

00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:43.720
This freaking sucks. I'm still head over heels
for Audrey and I probably will be for some time.

00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:48.400
But it's not meant to be right
now and that's okay because in the

00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:51.160
meantime I've got a lot to be thankful
for.

00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:56.080
I've got great friends...

00:14:58.140 --> 00:15:00.660
I have a fun job that-
Excuse me.

00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:03.380
Inner monologue again?
Yeah, sorry.

00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:05.620
Please finish.

00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:10.440
Actually...Why don't you take this one?

00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:15.360
The truth is life is not a sprint.

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:19.640
It's a really long marathon filled with
opportunities to grow,

00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:22.520
find joy, and create happiness.

00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:24.800
Those who live the best and fullest lives

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:29.420
don't focus on what's fleeting and
temporary, but instead focus on making

00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:31.980
it all the way through to the end.

00:15:31.980 --> 00:15:34.840
Nice guys don't finish last.
