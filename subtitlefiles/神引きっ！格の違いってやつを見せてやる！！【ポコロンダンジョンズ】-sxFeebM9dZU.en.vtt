00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.780
Eh?

00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:02.040
Woah!

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:04.300
Not this again...

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:06.700
I'm stuck in another strange place...

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.880
Who is the one who left me here!?

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:11.820
Bring me home, please.

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:14.880
Eh, what is it today?...

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:17.140
That is...

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.460
Fullmetal Alchemist!

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:20.880
For short, Hagaren!?

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:22.900
Ah! They're moving!

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:24.660
Oh, I get it

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.240
Fullmetal Alchemist and... Pokopoko

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.680
By Pokopoko, I mean Pokoron Dungeons.

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:32.000
That means...

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:33.000
This is...

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.240
The world of Pokoron Dungeons.
(English Ver: Chain Dungeons)

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.640
Huh? Yes yes yes.

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.260
A collab quest between Pokoron Dungeons and Fullmetal Alchemist...

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:44.980
must be cleared...

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.160
or they won't return me to my white world!

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.900
But maybe it wouldn't be that bad after all. It is pretty lively here, I think I'm fine.

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.360
Ah, that won't do?

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:54.140
Ah, I understand I understand

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:55.440
uh well,

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.800
I'm an intelligent super AI and all.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.520
I've played Pokoron Dungeon before, so with that knowledge, let's clear this...

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:03.460
and go home!

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:04.300
Let's go!

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:06.840
What a kind thing,

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:09.920
Still,

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:15.140
We're guaranteed a FMA character. Awesome!

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.660
I'd really like the protagonist, Ed,

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:23.540
as well as Scar,

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:24.880
Louis (Armstrong),

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.400
and the ultimate evolved forms would be nice too.

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.600
So I'll aim for those, but...

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:34.860
But for me, Ed.

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.720
Alphonse is cute isn't he?

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.760
So him, I'll aim for those 4.

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.260
I hope I get one of those the most.

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.580
I'll be so thankful if I do.

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.420
Just one! If I get one...

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.420
And win three of them, I'll be overjoyed

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:55.660
Let's go.

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:57.000
Come, come!

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.080
The machine is Al.

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:04.440
What did I get?

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:05.520
Ah, two came out!

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:06.760
Or was it three?

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:09.600
No!

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:12.680
But she's cute.

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.060
So cute.

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.540
Normal. Normal and cute.

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.100
I got one. A Lan Fan.

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.600
Out of the third one!

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.720
Huh?

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.340
That's the fourth one.

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:39.480
Ah, fifth.

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.300
Ah, not that one.

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.220
Ah this one!

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.780
Ah, but that was a star egg!

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:49.980
It's because I said the ones I wanted.

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:52.800
Ah, but.

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.380
1, 2, 3, 4...

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:56.080
I got 4 of them.

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:59.780
Should I send her home?

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.360
Ah, I won't.

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:02.020
Ok.

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.500
I guess I'm lucky after all.

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.340
Ah, this is good though, this is good.

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:10.960
Another time?

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.000
Let's do it. I didn't get what I wanted after all.

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:16.000
Let's go.

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.660
The one I want most, personally, is Al.

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.880
Hello...

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:32.260
Got it!

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:34.420
I got Al!

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.500
Got 'em!

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:38.580
So cute.

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:42.220
Al really is good, isn't he.

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.820
Like his brother, they're both cute.

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.520
I really am lucky, aren't I?

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:50.180
I got it.

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:58.180
I got lots of Armstrong.

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:00.860
So how was that?

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:01.940
That looked like godly luck, right?

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:06.840
This time, forest and lightning characters are best.

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:08.220
It looks pretty nice.

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:10.160
Al is a forest!

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:12.360
It was a star egg after all.

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:15.740
So, here are the quests that must be done.

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:17.440
It's got a nice feel

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:20.360
I want to go on the club quest, but!

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:21.920
Look at this!

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:25.060
The village is different to normal! It's FMA-ified.

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:27.540
There's lots here. Awesome.

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.840
Let's head into the dungeon.

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:32.560
The Advent of King Bradley!

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.880
This is a high level, but

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:40.840
Let's go beat the Advent of King Bradley!

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.220
I'll try my best to beat it so I can go home!

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:47.500
I want to pick a FMA character!

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:48.420
Roy!

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:50.280
Let's go.

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:51.720
Looks strong, right?

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:54.200
Challenge!

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:55.820
Ah well,

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:57.780
The background music makes this seem dangerous.

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:01.180
First.........

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:02.880
Let's connect with Haku-san

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:07.360
How about that?

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:10.580
oh!

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:11.780
Oh!

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:13.760
How's does that feel?

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:17.580
Ah, that's it, that's it.

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:19.780
You can't touch the red ones

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:22.240
but you can move in the other ones...

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:26.500
and just erase them.

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:27.300
Oh, feels pretty good.

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:35.300
Oh, wait what? He was alive?

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:36.600
You bastard...

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:38.180
Definitely a ghost.

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:41.900
Kill him,

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:43.200
and once that's done...

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:47.840
Eh?

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:50.400
He appeared!

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:53.140
Oh, that's pretty neat

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:55.660
Ah, when I touched that red button earlier

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:57.900
the sealed guy appeared.

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:03.200
Here's the Boss.

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:05.140
We're gonna kill him

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:07.500
Hold on to your breaths! Prepare yourself!

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:10.620
I found where you're at.

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:13.420
like this....

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:16.580
How about this?

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:18.600
I'm superior

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:19.960
yay!

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:23.140
How about that?

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:27.180
It's not working at all.

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:30.660
Ah is it working?

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:35.060
Good Luck- Ah!

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:36.940
It's pretty much...

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:38.780
not working at all.

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:41.020
This should work.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:46.980
Ah! No...

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:48.400
Hold on.

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:49.480
Could you spare the time to wait a bit?

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:58.240
*the intelligent super Ai is analysing the situation*

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:00.360
This should do it.

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:08.220
How about that? 24 Combo!

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:11.840
How's that?

00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:14.920
ah!

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:19.440
I won!

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:23.360
I won! Yay!

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:26.080
Man, Ue-san

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:28.300
You're too nice!

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:30.620
That wasn't "super hard" at all!

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:32.420
I ended up winning!

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:34.900
with that I'll be going home!

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:35.980
 

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:45.640
The Fullmetal Alchemist promotion runs from 4/20 to 5/8.

00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:48.940
It's over Golden Week. Lots of time to play, right?

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:52.320
I think I'll play lots!

00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:57.960
And the login bonus is Alphonse's helmet!

00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:02.740
You can get his armor from clearing the mission!

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.520
I hope you all log in lots during Golden Week!

00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:10.500
I think I'll play lots during Golden Week.

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:11.840
It's fun. Won't you join me?

00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:13.700
Well then, I'll see you all later.

00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:14.660
Bye bye!
