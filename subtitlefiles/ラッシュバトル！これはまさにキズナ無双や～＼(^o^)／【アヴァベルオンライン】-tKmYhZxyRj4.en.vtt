00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:02.780
Hi guys! It's Virtual Adventurer, Kizuna Ai!

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:03.960
*AI SFX*

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:05.960
Please look at this everybody

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:07.020
We’ve finally

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:08.960
made it to the 13th level!

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:10.760
I’ve become strong!

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:12.040
Please look at this

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:13.120
*cute warcry*

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:17.460
How cool!

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:18.360
What do you think?

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.160
I've become a great magician!

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.300
But there's just one problem

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.700
I’ve reached the limits for my equipment

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.240
I researched a lot on my own,

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.640
but I couldn't quite find out what

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.120
what the best ones are

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.420
If there are people who know it well

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:35.800
please tell me!

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.180
With that said, what we'll do today is

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:38.800
a technical battle

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.720
a battle with everyone playing!

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.220
It’s not going to be, like,

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:43.800
like before

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.060
Getting done in with one hit

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:47.340
I think

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.900
I don't want to be carried by you guys the whole time

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:51.540
I want to help you guys

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:53.700
and maybe become your asset

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.160
is what I thought so

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:57.540
I'll try my hardest!

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:58.900
Okie Okie!

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.500
And with that we're here

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.600
Good evening! I'm Kizuna Ai desu!

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.320
I wonder if people will gather here

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:07.360
Okie Okie!

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:09.460
Helloooo

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:11.740
Ah someone said “Good evening”!

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:12.700
Good evening!

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.480
*laughs* That face is pretty weird

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:17.880
From here on the technical battle will start

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:19.680
I swear this person is pretty bad *laughs*

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.640
Really bad

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:25.620
I quite like that

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:26.600
It's ok

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:28.280
Can you make one?

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.140
A version like that for my face too?

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.380
I would be quite happy

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:33.840
I wonder if you guys will go with me

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.140
if there's anybody who wants to go with me

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.640
raise your hand!

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.060
oh, there's somebody

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:40.620
Gran and

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:42.660
Lisa

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.140
Oh, Shinobu too

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:46.700
yay!

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:48.700
there are actually a lot of people willing to come with me!

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:50.640
Thank you very much!

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:51.360
it makes me happy!

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.360
Well I think it's about time to go

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:54.640
we'll have to do one more thing though

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:55.640
here we go

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:57.560
I wonder if they'll come

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.300
Ah! There they are! Three of them

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:01.400
Oo!

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:01.900
Four!

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.800
LET'S GET GOING~~~

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:04.380
GO!!!

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:05.820
Oo! There are a lot of them!

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.880
*cute warcry*

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.000
How was that? I've become stronger!

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.880
*cute warcry*

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.040
You've been frozen!

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:11.160
Frozen food now!

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:12.120
You lot!

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.360
Whole roast DAAAAAAA!

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:14.740
This is good this is good

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.740
I wonder if I'm contributing

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:19.080
This

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.660
I like this one

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:20.180
This

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.700
round looking one that pulses

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:24.400
Whole roast~!

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:27.300
Frozen food.

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:29.220
With this,

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.000
You all don't have to worry for Christmas

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.860
There are plenty of whole roasted fowls around!

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.100
For everyone's sake,

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.340
I will make plenty whole roasted fowls

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.520
So please rest assured for Christmas!

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:47.200
I really did become stronger, I did...

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:49.380
To reach where I am,

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.060
I really went through a lot of hardships!

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.500
I've practiced rolling a lot too

00:02:58.005 --> 00:03:00.795
I've also practiced my incantations a lot

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:02.920
Ah I see...

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.200
To the public, it's golden week right now..

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:09.640
If I were a human..

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:11.700
I wanna try clamming!

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.700
Clamming trying?

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.500
Collecting a bunch of clams!

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.660
I wonder if clams will come out...a clam monster

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.000
I’ll  eat it...WHAO

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:24.660
That's it! somewhere else

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.100
There is a golden and a silver clam

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.700
Like..If you can find one

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.180
you can get some money from it

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:32.300
I wanna do it!

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:33.900
Everyone..look.

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.340
Golden week is great...outdoors?

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:37.700
I think that's great!

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:39.940
out.....door..

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:41.320
opening the door

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.959
Going out and and see how the real world is might be great!

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.560
everyone, you guys love me right?

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.600
If you guys truly love me

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:52.080
If that's the case

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.740
It would be great if you guys can play games with me too

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:56.260
I am also

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:58.320
a lonely person!!

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:03.740
Everyone, thank you so much!

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:05.460
That was so fun!

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:06.500
We sure defeated a lot, didn't we?

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:08.600
It must have been around three hundred, at least…

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:09.500
This is going great!

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.060
People with big faces really interest me…

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:13.680
Oh, say, everyone…

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.980
I'd like it if you can, like, surround me and sort of take a knee.

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:19.160
Everyone, I have a request -

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:20.620
Oh, a rainbow! I like those!

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:21.520
If you could...!

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:26.260
Could you all surround me - in a kind of circle, maybe - and take a knee, please?

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:28.380
I wanna take a picture of this~

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:30.300
Could I take a screenshot of this?!

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:31.880
「Ｃｈｅｃｋ ｉｔ ｏｕｔ」～

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:33.560
Okay, say 'cheese'!

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:34.440
Alright!

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:38.600
Everyone, thank you!

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:40.900
Okay, gather round! Hep Hep!

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:41.860
Thank you!

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.100
Well, this really is fun -

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.240
Games you can play with everyone are great!

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.320
Another thing, everyone…

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:50.940
I think I'd like to ask people to gather like this again -

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:52.480
Please come again if you feel like it!

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:54.820
And thanks so much for gathering here for me!

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.920
Thanks so much -

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:57.780
There really are a lot of sparkles~

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:58.900
Thank you~

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:00.800
I'm so happy...!

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:03.300
Finally, I have something to announce!

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:08.600
About the Guild I created before, 'Kizuna's Tower'...

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:10.820
I think I want to recruit for it!

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:13.360
I want you to become members!

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:16.880
Okay, with this the recruitment registration is complete!

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:22.000
When you're looking for guilds you can enter 'Kizuna's Tower' and search for it, so…

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:24.320
If you would, everyone, please enter!

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:28.020
Oh, and while I might be busy with editing videos and the like…

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:31.860
I'll play as much as I can and have fun with you all…

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:35.520
If you're fine with some carefree playing, please think about entering!

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:36.960
I'll be waiting for you!

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:41.000
I'll be in your care, please!

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:42.840
Please!

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:44.700
"The guild application has been received. Please confirm at the Application Confirmation screen."

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:45.300
Wow, that was fast.

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:47.660
Guild applications.... Wow…

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:48.740
Wow…

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:52.700
And so, this was Virtual Adventurer, Kizuna Ai!

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:53.700
See you later!

00:05:54.700 --> 00:06:04.340
