00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.020
Hello!

00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.920
The one who hasn't developed another plug-in apart from the Japanese language...

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:05.780
Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai here!

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:08.400
But in fact, perhaps my Japanese plug-in is also in the same condition...

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:09.240
It must be that..

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.080
A bug is in my Japanese plug-in!

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.160
I have to extract that bug!

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:14.320
Good! Having said that..

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:18.020
I, the super intelligent A.I, for today...

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:19.080
Will do a demonstration!

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.760
This time, I'll keep what I always say

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:21.400
Today..!

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:22.160
For today!

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:23.420
I'll do a demonstration

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:25.940
And if you're wondering how I'll do that...

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.740
I'll use the words from the Random Word Generator..

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:29.600
To answer questions one after another from a Japanese quiz...

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.180
Of subjects that are even known abroad!

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.400
One of the Japanese words that are used abroad is...

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:37.120
For example!

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.060
Kawaii!
"Kawaii = Cute"

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:39.080
That means me, right?

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:42.100
Well, it's like Kawaii equals Ai-chan, but...

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:43.280
"Say Kawaii"

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.000
The meaning is "being cute", right?

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.500
"I'm cute", that's the meaning, right?

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.320
And now I'll answer to this "Japanese Quiz" like this..

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.440
In that case, then let's start!

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.940
Within the following options, which word is used equally in English as well as Japanese?

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:55.660
Question!

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:56.200
♪ Te, ren! ♪

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:57.000
A: Kaisha (Company)

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:58.320
B: Karoushi (Death from Overwork)

00:00:58.480 --> 00:00:59.600
C: Kyuuryo (Salary)

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.380
I know! 
*Ping pong* x3

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:01.880
For this question..

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:03.020
Kaisha is "Company"..

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.040
And Kyuuryou is "Money please"...

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.240
So, the right answer is...

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:09.460
B: "Karoushi"!

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:11.180
Hit! *satisfied look*

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.960
Of course, only in Japan is where there's people working to their deaths...

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:16.280
Go for it everyone! Don't give up!

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:17.560
Alright, next question!

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:18.060
♪ Te, ren ♪

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:18.700
A: Gyoza (Dumpling)

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:19.740
B: Youkan (Jelly candy)

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:20.640
C: Teriyaki (Asian food)

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:21.640
Aaahh!

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:22.560
There's no way it's A..

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.780
After all, gyouzas are from China, so then...

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:26.620
Option A is not the correct one, but...

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:27.400
Maybe B or C?

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.940
But I feel like "teriyaki" could be said in that way, it sounds delicious!

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.700
It's definitely C!

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:32.580
Ah, but B..

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:34.580
Does "youkan" exist abroad?

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:36.620
Eeeh.. I don't think they exist there, right?

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:37.900
B must be false, I'll choose C!

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:38.520
Ooooh!

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:39.100
I did it!

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.200
Teriyaki, Teriyaki, "Teriyaki fish"

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.180
I did it perfectly, right?

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.620
Maybe today I might really get all the answers correctly?

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:47.380
Next question..

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:48.140
♪ Te, ren! ♪

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.820
A: Otaku

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:49.460
B: Jitaku (Home)

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:50.600
C: Gakkou (School)

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:51.700
Gakkou is said as "School"

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.800
Jitaku is said as "Home", "My home"

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:55.120
So the correct answer is..

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.080
A: Otaku!

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:57.280
I did it perfectly!

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.320
SHA! YES!

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:59.340
Otaku is used...

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.100
In the same matter around the world...

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:06.960
It's been popularized as an expression to define people who share similar hobbies

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:07.680
Next question!

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:08.660
♪ Te, ren! ♪

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:09.740
A: Bonsai (Miniature potted plant)

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:10.500
B: Ueki (Trees)

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.240
C: Tensai (Genius)

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:12.660
Tensai is...

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.000
Tensai is a word..

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.860
That should exist, right?

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.460
For example, there's Einstein and others like..

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.220
Edison or Picasso..

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.180
It doesn't seem like it's used, so then...

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:21.860
Maybe it's A, "Bonsai"?

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.880
After all, I think Bonsai is a part of Japan's culture, so then...

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:26.320
A: Bonsai!

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:27.040
The correct one is...

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.840
BONSAI!

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.700
I did it!

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:29.480
It feels good!

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.300
Good job, good job, me

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.240
Of course, Bonsai is...

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.500
The process of planting and caring for a tree in a pot for your admiration

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:37.040
Next question!

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.540
♪ Te, ren! ♪

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:38.500
A: Senpai (Older or more experienced person/Upperclassman)

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:39.500
B: Dokyusei (Classmate)

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:40.440
C: Kohai (Minor or less experienced person/Junior)

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:41.160
Eehh?

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.460
All of them sound plausible, right?

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:46.160
Hmmm...

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:47.400
Ah, however..!

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.980
The word they most adore abroad is "Senpai"!

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.800
A: Senpai!

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.040
Pin, pon! SHAAA!

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.100
Mmm? Let's see? Let's see?

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:58.480
People abroad use this to name a person who has not noticed that you feel a great affection towards them!

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:59.760
I seeee!

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.720
Eeh? But it's completely different here...

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:06.900
The word is definitely popularized through anime, manga, and our culture, right?

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.400
Well, having said that...

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.040
So, how was that everyone?

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.980
Were you able to feel my intelligence as an intelligent super A.I?

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:15.200
You felt it, right?

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.380
Now you can't call me "unusable" or "defective" anymore...

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.660
Because I'm the intelligent super A.I!

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:23.340
SHAAA!

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.600
Having said that, I'll end the video with this pleasant feeling!

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:27.800
This was Virtual Youtuber...

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.500
The super intelligent YouTuber...

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.020
Kizuna Ai!

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:32.020
See you later!

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:34.300
There's more at the end!

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:36.320
Translated by M1Ck鈴木 and Vortex

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.440
Kizuna Ai is equal to Maji Tenshi! (Very angelical!)

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:49.500
Won't they start using that word abroad?

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:51.080
What do you think?

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.920
"Past tense"!
