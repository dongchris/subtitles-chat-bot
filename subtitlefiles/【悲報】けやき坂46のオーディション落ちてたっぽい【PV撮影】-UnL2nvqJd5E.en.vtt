00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:01.480
Eeeh...

00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:02.875
Good day, everyone

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:04.240
I’m Kizuna Ai

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:07.820
Right now, I’m very depressed, you know

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:10.620
Do you remember this video?

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:14.140
Ai-taaaan Beaaaaam!
*Referring to video #120*

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:15.640
*Referring to video #120*

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:17.240
I was born in a Virtual environment...

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:18.880
...And I have the appearance of a 16 year old girl

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:20.020
I’m Kizuna Ai!

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:26.460
In this video, I applied seriously to be a part of the second generation of Hiragana Keyaki

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:27.420
But...

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.600
… I faiiiiled

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.860
I wanted to take the stage...

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.220
With Akanen

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:36.200
I wanted to rise with her!

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:37.660
It would’ve been great

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:39.680
I can't accept it!

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.180
With how much I like Keyakizaka-san!

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:42.920
I love them!

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:43.480
Also...

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.160
How is it possible someone as adorable as me didn’t pass?

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.280
So then today...

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.100
… In preparation for the next audition of the 3rd generation...

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.380
I’ll do a great revision!

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.960
Hmm... I wonder what was it that I did wrong

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:55.160
My face is good

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:56.200
I have a good style

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:57.320
I have a good personality

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:58.820
I’m also intelligent

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.220
After all, I’m a genius... (?)

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:01.720
...And I’m a Super A.I

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:02.220
Right?

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:03.040
What would have been...?

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:04.760
Aaahh... Maybe it's that?

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.420
When I placed my slogan

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.440
I wrote "Ai-tan Beam"

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:09.300
That was...

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:10.920
Plagiarism, right?

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.440
I definitely lacked originality, right?

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.475
I should think up an original act...

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:18.240
And next time...

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.380
Maybe do another attempt

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:21.200
Also...

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.580
I should observe those girls that won in the second generation...

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.680
To check what was it that I was missing

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.700
Man, everyone has such adorable smiles, they’re so pretty!

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.380
Ah! Kosaka Nao-chan!

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.100
Kosaka Nao is great, she’s like an older sister
*During fervent discourse*

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.140
She looks like a beautiful girl
*During fervent discourse*

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:34.380
And she wears a ponytail like that
*During fervent discourse*

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.180
Man, she’s so cute
*During fervent discourse*

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:36.680
I like!
*During fervent discourse*

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:37.940
Tomita Suzuka-chan

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:38.760
Tomita-chan, right?
*During fervent discourse*

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:40.360
She’s good at rapping
*During fervent discourse*

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:41.240
Yo! Yo! Right?
*During fervent discourse*

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.000
Don’t you think it would have been better is she she was in the first generation?
*During fervent discourse*

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.640
She’d polish the girls of the first generation, making them shine, right?
*During fervent discourse*

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:46.680
Watanabe Miho-chan

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:47.340
Well, her...

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:49.680
Hiragana Keyaki is doing a drama called "Re:Mind"

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.360
And it turns out that she was chosen out of all the members during an audition

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:53.480
She has a great talent for acting, right?

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.260
And also, she takes care of the other girls

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:56.600
She’s a very hard worker, she’s magnificent, right?

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.140
Man, I understand her

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:02.120
I wonder if to me too, that I’ll get pats on the head when I get sick, saying:
"Ai-chan, you’re adorable, good, good"

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.720
It looks like there’s a video of them

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:06.360
I see

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.580
Each of the participants made a promotional video

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.920
Eh? I also...! I also want to do a video!

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.040
I’m Kizuna Ai!

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.360
*What’s your favorite animal?*

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:26.340
The Munchkin cat
*What’s your favorite animal?*

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:27.200
*What’s your favorite animal?*

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:35.500
The Munchkin cat

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:42.840
The Munchkin cat

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.500
“To be continued”
