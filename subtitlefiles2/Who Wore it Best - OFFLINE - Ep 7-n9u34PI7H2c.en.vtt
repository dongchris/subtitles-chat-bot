00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:07.040
Hey guys, the t-shirts for our movie came in.

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.860
Ooh!

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:12.080
Perfect timing, we can wear them to our screening event tonight.

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:15.749
Ooh perfect timing, I've been meaning to do laundry. Now I don't have to.

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:19.580
Um wait a second.

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:21.060
What?

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.780
There's no more guys shirts in here. It's only girls tank tops.

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:25.499
Well, I'm already wearing this shirt, so...

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:28.800
So what? Let me try.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:29.840
No!

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:31.920
I don't want to wear a girl's tank top.

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.440
There's only one way to settle this then.

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:39.700
[music starts]

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:41.120
Oh, yeah.

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:43.260
[sigh]

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.340
All right Christine, who won?

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.060
It's no contest. Just give me the shirt.

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.100
No.

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.680
Look this whole thing was a waste of time. We all know who should wear the shirt to the event

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.290
Yes, me, because everyone wants to take pictures with me. I should wear it.

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.080
Yeah, they take pictures with you because you hog the camera.

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:53.900
We all know who the fans want to see.

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:57.460
You guys are always taking the attention. Give the new guys a chance! You old.

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.140
Shut it Taylor. You have no idea what you're... [talking over one another]

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:02.880
Enough!

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.709
Look at you guys bickering and taking cheap shots at each other.

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:10.380
Over what? A t-shirt?

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.330
Are you forgetting what's on the shirt? It's the movie that we made with each other.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.119
Together. As one.

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.780
Forever.

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:21.720
Eternally.

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:28.240
Who cares who wears the t-shirt? What's most important is that we made a great film that touched many lives all over the world!

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:34.580
Don't forget what really matters okay? It's our family, and the support of our fans.

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.640
So f***ing get over it!

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.440
[music]

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:58.580
Let me try... Oh God. That was so hard sorry. Sorry sorry!

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.580
I don't want to wear a girls tank top.

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.340
You guys are always taking the detention

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:20.940
Wait! Sorry- I meant-

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:27.740
Just go!

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:30.140
I don't want to!

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:47.480
Looks like you won the guys t-shirt!

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.240
Yeah, I think this fits a little bit better for me

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.840
That's good!

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:51.319
Just like you saw in the episode,

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:57.069
we made some very limited edition tank tops, t-shirts and phone cases. If you guys like this shirt,

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:00.488
it's actually based off our movie poster, and it's only available for ten days

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:03.460
So make sure you click the link below and get it while you can.

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:05.980
Plus they're super comfy like I've been wearing mine for like three days

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.030
Me, too

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:13.420
By getting one of these shirts, you are directly helping Wong Fu productions make more videos and series like Offline.

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:18.540
And once you get your shirt, make sure you wear it and hashtag Everything Before Us, so we can see it and maybe repost your photo

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:25.620
So don't wait because once the campaign is over you'll never be able to get one of these ever again. Don't delay. Oh!

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.360
Don't de-Tay

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.140
What are you doing back here?

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.940
I don't know
