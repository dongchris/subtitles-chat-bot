00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.060
Hey! Welcome back!

00:00:03.595 --> 00:00:05.015
You are tired, aren't you?

00:00:05.845 --> 00:00:07.595
Well done today!

00:00:08.785 --> 00:00:11.635
Do you want to bathe first?

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:14.660
Or do you want to eat something?

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:17.440
Huh?

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:19.800
You want me to clean your ears?

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.160
I see I have no other choice

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:26.720
You're like a spoiled child~

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.600
Well, come here...

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:32.940
Put your head on my lap

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:34.980
Come on

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:39.120
There we go!

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.380
How was today?

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.000
You seem more tired than usual

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:52.160
Relax

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:54.540
Hehehe...

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.320
What’s up?

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:02.200
Eeh?

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.900
Your face is getting red...

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:09.360
How cute...

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.660
May we go there?

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:16.120
Ahh!

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.600
Your ears are red...

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.820
Huh? Are you somewhat...

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:26.420
Shy?

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:32.820
Ah, Sorry! Sorry!

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:35.680
Eh?

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.440
Are you really mad at me?

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.080
No, I’m sorry, it was just a joke!

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.940
Ah! I spoke in a dialect without meaning to...

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.680
No, It’s just that...

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.780
I was really worried about whether or not I made you mad...

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:58.920
Ah… hey, what do you think of playing a game with me?

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:01.300
And if we play that?

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:03.300
The “I love you” game?

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Ehhh?

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:06.820
You don't know it?

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.380
In that case... I'll explain the rules to you!

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.440
You have to stare each other...

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:22.580
And tell the other person "I love you", right?

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.280
And then...

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.680
The other person must reply: "Once more"

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.780
The one that gets embarrassed, loses the game

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.840
Did you understand?

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:35.400
Ok!

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.980
Then, I'll start first...

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.260
In that case, here I go!

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.720
I love you

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:49.600
Ok!

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.160
You lose!

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:54.660
Then, as a penalty...

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.040
You'll have to...

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.680
Tell me 10 things you like about me every morning!

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.020
We'll continue...

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:05.780
Next time...

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:14.080
