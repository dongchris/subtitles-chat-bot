00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.680
Hello! Virtual Youtuber Kizuna Ai here!

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:05.680
As you know, sometimes I’m a little derpy, but

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:09.780
I'm the intelligent super A.I. Kizuna Ai-chan!

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:10.900
Today...

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.120
There’s gonna be some trivia following a certain theme

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.020
that I would I like to show everyone

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.620
However!

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:18.260
I'm not just going to tell them to you!

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:19.960
There's one that's the real thing.

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:21.060
There’s also...

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.880
Another one, that I will think of it on the spot

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:25.600
A trivia full of lies!
Lies!

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.200
To the participants,

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.180
please choose the correct answer

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:30.740
as well as you can!

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.140
Your wealth of knowledge

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:33.080
is being tested!

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.120
Then, without further ado

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:35.040
Let's go~!

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:36.740
I'm going to draw now!

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:38.160
*A.I. SFX*

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.860
JAN!

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:40.620
Cream puffs! (shu kurimu)

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.020
I see

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.680
And the trivia is...?

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:44.480
hm hm

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.500
Ah I knew this already!

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.000
As expected of my intellect!

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:48.600
Then

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:49.280
Let's go

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:50.740
First up is A

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:52.660
"Shu" means cabbage in french!

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:54.920
Because it looks like cabbage

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.180
It's a cabbage with cream in it

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.680
Hence, it became cream puffs (shu kurimu)!

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.300
Did you know that?

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:02.920
The next choice is B.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.420
The first person to have eaten a cream puff

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.180
was dating a boy named "Shu"

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.140
And that is when,

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.860
they also first tasted the kiss

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.120
of shu-kun, SO

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.320
It was named shu-kurimu (cream puffs)!

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:19.540
Did you know that?

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:20.340
Well then!

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.480
The real answer could be… A or B.

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.040
Which one is it?

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.140
Thinking time, start!

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:32.960
*Tri...vi...a....*

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.960
Ok! That's it!

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:36.360
The answer is...

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.700
A!

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:40.420
Well, that was easy.

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.400
If you didn't answer this correctly, well, that's not good.

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:46.660
Let's go for the next one!

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:50.880
Baby!

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.900
I see.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:53.420
So... the answer?

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:55.120
Ohhhh….

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:56.800
I didn't know this.

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.640
I just became smarter.

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:00.000
First choice, A!

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.780
When a baby is born, the reason why they cry is because..

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.240
the passage they passed through was too narrow..and they start crying

00:02:07.335 --> 00:02:09.995
eeeeeeeeeeen..like that. because it hurt

00:02:09.995 --> 00:02:10.995
they cry

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:12.520
Option B!

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:14.900
A baby's crying voice when they are born

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.060
has no correlation with race or culture

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.940
Every baby in the world cries in the same volume,

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.580
with the same "la" sound

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:23.980
LAAAAAAA~~~

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:25.660
That's not right ww

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.260
On the scale of "la",

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:28.100
they'll be crying.

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:29.500
And so, everyone

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.000
Do you know which one it is?

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.700
So, which is the true trivia?

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:33.540
A or B?

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:34.580
Which one I wonder!

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.000
Thinking time...Start!

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.100
Trivia

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.440
Tri....vi....a

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.380
Trivia...Trivia...

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.100
Times up!

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.920
So, everyone

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.180
Have you guys figured out which one is the right answer? The right answer is....

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.160
B it is!!

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:56.960
Is there anyone getting the wrong answer?

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:59.660
But...probably...A is actually..maybe..

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.300
not wrong...I think…?

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:03.660
Please google it..

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.360
Well then, on to the next one!

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.120
*A.I SFX*

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.820
JAN!

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:09.540
YUUCHUUBU!

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.440
This is something I already know so well now

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:12.180
So so well!!

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.980
And the trivia...?

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:15.220
hm hm

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:18.980
Ooooooo!

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.820
I see.

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:21.320
Option A!

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:22.940
The founding motivation was

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.740
when the founder distributed videos of a party to his friends

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:30.860
and thought how nice it would be if everyone could share videos easily!

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:31.700
And so,

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.140
He created the website!

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:34.480
Option B!

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:39.160
the creator of Youtube loves the artists "Tube" from Japan

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.800
with the notion of "I want to introduce you to ‘Tube’!"

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.240
That's how YouTube is named after it

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.935
So everyone...Have you all figured out the correct trivia here?

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.380
Thinking time...Start!

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:51.660
Trivia...

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:53.300
Trivia..

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:54.800
Tri-vi-a...

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:56.080
Trivia~~~

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.080
Times up!!

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:01.000
Did you guys get the right answer? The correct answer is....

00:04:01.005 --> 00:04:02.800
not B but A!

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:04.540
Did I fool you guys?

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:08.400
Please be honest if you got fooled and tell me down below in the comment section

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:09.840
How was it?

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:12.600
Well, that was quite a game, right?

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:16.380
There are probably a lot of you guys fooled. I'm sorry about that!

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.700
Of course, even though I'm such an Intelligent super A.I

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.840
I still got quite a lot of trivia I've never heard of

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:25.780
So everyone, please tell me any trivia that I'm not aware of!

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:30.320
