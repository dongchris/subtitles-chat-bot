Hello, everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai here!

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:05.880
Lately, people have been saying things about me

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.720
Kizuna Ai, you're kind of like a geezer!

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:10.540
How is that possible!?

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.980
Although I don't know my own gender...

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:15.300
At the very least!

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:16.960
I don't think I'm a geezer!

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:18.540
I mean, look how cute I am

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:19.920
So, this time...

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.560
in order to deny these geezer allegations...

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.000
I’ll show you all the heights of my girliness!

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:26.860
For today...

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:30.480
Been a while, but I’ll answer questions from you all

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.840
What does Ai-chan want the most for now?

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.000
Hum... Let me think...

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.900
Since I am virtual...

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.520
This is a bit hard for me...

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:42.860
But if I became human...

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.460
Maybe a watch from Marc Jacobs!♪

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.840
How does Ai-chan deal with stress?

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:51.940
Um... Well...

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:56.380
For starters, I don't really have much stress

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:57.710
If I did...

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.360
I’d chat with the stars in the sky...

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:01.790
Well, joking aside,

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:04.720
I’d go to karaoke with friends, I guess

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.410
Though, I don’t have any friends...

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:09.660
What would you do if you took a long break?

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.740
Um... if I took a long break

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:13.820
I would go with my friends...

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.300
to play at a beach somewhere in Okinawa

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.060
And take selfies~

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:23.220
and eat deliciously pretty food

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.320
And gaze upon the stars at night...

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.080
while having girls talk♡

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.240
Something like this?

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.790
I am envious about Ai-chan's beautiful skin!

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.950
What comestics do you use?

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:36.570
Hum? Really?

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:38.110
Is it really that beautiful?

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:39.600
I’m so happy!

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.580
But, I actually...

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.410
don’t wear any makeup~

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:44.200
Really really!

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:45.080
I don’t!

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:46.790
Wanna feel it?

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:48.920
I-it feels embarrassing to not wear any makeup...

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:50.400
in front of this many people

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:51.130
But! But!

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.270
The way to keep beautiful skin...

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.520
is to sleep and wake up early!

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:58.210
Ahhh! This is embarrassing!

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:00.060
Ahh...

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:02.920
No good!

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:04.490
Seriously, no good!

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:05.280
I’m sorry!

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.080
I’m not right for that personality

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.000
No gooood!

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.660
I love cute girls!

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:11.520
I say bad things…

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:12.920
and shout obscenities!!

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.620
Though I’m sometimes speak like a geezer...

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:15.870
Please don’t abandon me!

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.430
Please...

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
