00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:07.560
When I was in ninth grade one of the things about entering high school that I was most excited about was finally being able to

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.280
Ask girls to dances, as an official date. Two reasons

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.880
why this was significant: number one, my middle school dances didn't allow dates.

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:15.809
I don't know,

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.718
Maybe they thought that the kids were too young and they were afraid that they'd get all

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:24.180
freaky on the dance floor; so all those dances just ended up being the awkward kind where all the guys stood on one side and

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.789
The girls on another and each time you wanted to dance, you have to make that treacherous march over to the other side and ask.

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:33.119
Number two, my parents were strict as h*ck

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.520
"No dating till you're married!!!"
 So for sure there is no dating in Junior High.

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:42.719
So finally I reached high school. I was practically a "grown-up",

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.230
I was a man

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:49.720
And it was time for this man to get a date - a dance partner for the whole night and finally

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.860
live out all my teen movie "falling in love" fantasies

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:59.180
Luckily my parents were cool with me at least being social, so now I had an excuse.
"hey mom,

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:04.110
everyone has to go with someone. I have to have a date!" 
(That's my Puberty voice)

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:07.260
along comes the first semi-formal dance of the year -

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:13.500
Homecoming. I've been ready for this one since the seventh grade and I knew exactly who I wanted to ask. 
A girl

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:19.049
I had a crush on since the seventh grade. Let's call her Tonya. 
Tonya and I were friends...?

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.339
I mean, I was actually never totally sure if she knew that I was crushing on her the last couple years

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:29.129
But if she knew, she did a pretty dang good job hiding it like most girls do, cuz we were pretty cool buddies :)

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.860
She was going to be my first. Date. Ever.

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:39.040
I picked Friday for when to ask her, just to give her the weekend to think about it, or to give me time to heal

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.060
If she rejected me ...

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:47.790
The moment of truth came; we were walking alone to our lockers after class, 
"Uh.. I.." and I chickened out.

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.079
I was just way too nervous.
but no worries Phil! It's your first time.
 Asked her at lunch...

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:59.140
Nope, didn't happen. 
Okay. Fine. You have last period with her, you better do it. This is what you've been training for.

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:00.780
"Uhh.. I"

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:03.449
Still couldn't get those words out..
 and don't judge!

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.380
I don't think most girls understand how terrifying it is at that age to ask a girl out.

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.380
I was still watching Pokemon,

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:14.458
you expect me to know how to woo a girl??? 
Come on. 
It all came down to the very end of the day.

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:21.779
I pushed it to the very end. This was it. I found her out her locker. I finally asked her to homecoming and then..

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.190
She says no.

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:31.310
Well, not exactly a flat-out "No"
she actually said, "I don't know if I'm gonna go so you should just ask someone else~

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.470
K!" 
What a Cop-out.

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.000
I took it like a champ though, played it off cool, but inside I was dying.

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.980
She even said that she'd help me find someone else to ask. WOW,

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.190
Thanks...?

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:50.209
Unfortunately, this is not where the story ends. See, I did end up asking someone else, another girl who I was friends with and she

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:51.800
Was a great date! We had an awesome time,

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:58.180
I think...
I mean I bought the tix, got her corsage, went to dinner, and it was off to the dance...

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.700
And who do I see there?

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:01.960
Tonya.

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:06.400
And no, she's not with someone else. 
She's by herself.

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:08.860
She'd rather go alone,

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:10.640
than go with me.

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:15.640
A non-date chumped me.
AIR was better company than me.

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.080
I was crushed, and she looked like she was enjoying herself.

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.780
Aaaand that was the first time I ever asked a girl to a dance.

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:30.260
What? Oh, no. I don't have a lesson for the story it just sucked. It's been how many years and I still remember?
That's all.

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.070
Anyway, I think we're gonna try and do some of these kinds of videos once in a while

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:37.070
If you guys like them, that is.
We've got some stories from our oximeers [&lt;--wut]

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:42.200
And maybe it'll help some of you to know that we went through them, and still turned out, okay...
Well, sort of..

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:45.200
TONYAAA!

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.040
See you later.

00:03:48.040 --> 00:04:00.000
