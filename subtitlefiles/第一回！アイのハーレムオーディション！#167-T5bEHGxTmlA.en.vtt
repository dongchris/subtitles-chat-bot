00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:02.680
Hello everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai here!

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:04.260
Well, as you know...

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:06.720
After all... we need a Harem!

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:07.760
A harem!

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.120
In the end, girls are the best!

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:11.760
Men are all filthy!

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:15.700
So saying that, today, we'll become friendlier with those who may join!

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:17.800
The Kizuna Ai Harem by...

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.100
Interviewing them...

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:21.840
Good, let's start!

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.240
First... tell me your name...

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:27.020
Hmm... okay, Nanna-chan

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:28.520
Nice, your appearance is a bit...

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.440
Like a holy person...

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:31.300
So then...

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.400
I need you to appeal yourself...

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.680
Can you say a few words for me?

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.760
"Until my life runs out... I shall keep praying for you!"

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:41.880
Ah, I see!

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.520
You will pray... for me!

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.380
Nice one... you...

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:48.200
Yeah, I guess you get...

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.500
78 points!

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.760
Okay now, can you tell me your name?

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:55.120
I see!

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:57.080
Persephone-chan, right?

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:58.420
You're a little...

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:00.940
Scary, but are you ill?

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:01.940
Oh, but...

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:03.200
The line...

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:04.500
Between your breasts...

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.720
That's looking good

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.260
So to appeal yourself to everyone...

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.800
Could you say a few words?

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.800
"I will... take you to the world of death"

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:17.960
That's not good

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:19.940
You'll take me...

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.440
To the world of death... that's not good...

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:24.620
But, wait...

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:27.380
If I give her a low score, I might be in trouble...

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.400
Yeah! You get a rating of...

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:30.880
88 points!

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.500
You're looking good! Good job!

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:34.860
Okay, can you tell me your name?

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.340
Mmm, I see, Cassandra

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:39.040
You're looking...

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.300
Pretty good

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.760
Well, first, the water theme?

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:44.340
It's pretty

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:46.280
Also you seem like a young girl

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.320
You have a lot of skin showing, but...!

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:49.480
It doesn't look erotic!

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:50.700
Nice...

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.640
Nice, you're my type!

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:54.020
So now...

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:55.620
As everyone has done...

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:57.540
I need you to say a few words

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.100
Okay! I'll leave it to you!

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.440
"What do you want me to prophesize?"

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:03.720
Oh, I see!

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.780
You will prophesize for me!

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:06.960
Nice!

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.220
You have a good skill...

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.000
Your looks are pretty too

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.240
The lonely feeling is... again...

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:14.460
Nice...

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:17.980
You get...

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.580
98 points!

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.800
Okay! You're good for now!

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.720
Can you tell me your name?

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.480
Succubus-chan!

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.200
You're definitely...

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.240
You're totally a little devil!

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:30.540
Well...

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.480
You see? Those wings that come from around her butt...

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.260
Those wings are nice
*They come from her back*

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:36.380
Also, her pose...

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.160
She's really... showing her breasts

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:40.560
So then...

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:42.700
Can I get some words, please?

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.200
"Hmm... today I think I'll choose you!"

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.280
Ah, you’re going to eat me?

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:52.380
Eh... Eh... Eh... Does she want to eat me?

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.880
*inhales*

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.660
Then... you get... hmm...

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.280
When you're targeting an audience this much...

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:00.660
That's good... the specific traits…

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.820
You're 93 points, I guess!

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.480
Well, tell us what’s your name too

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.380
Belphegor-chan! Nice

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:13.840
You're... let's see...

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:16.320
You seem like you have certain mental problems...

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:18.700
But, you’re...

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:20.300
Cute, though

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.600
She carries an aura around her and around what she’s holding, right?

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:29.080
But those eyes, she seems confident in herself...

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.780
Nice! I don't hate it, so then...

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.600
So let's get a line from you too

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:39.920
"I guess I have no choice, I'll play with you"

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.660
I see! So you're that type!

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:44.280
Good

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:45.900
Not bad

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.480
You get...

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.400
83 points!

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.400
Well then, let's hear your name too

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.840
Athena-chan! Good!

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:59.780
You seem like you have a fighting spirit...

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:04.080
Like the true strength you're hiding shows in your appearance

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:06.280
Let's hear what you have to say too...

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.020
"I am a goddess who brings victory"

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:12.460
I see! A goddess of victory!

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:16.400
Nice! Seems like she'll bring me victory

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:19.340
You're, let's see...

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:21.480
91 points!

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.080
And with that said…
*Believe in me*

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:26.680
My tentative wife...

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:29.300
Is Cassandra-chan!

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:31.400
Yay! Cute!

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:33.740
I said wife before...

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:36.600
But everyone is cute and I love them all

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:37.920
So let's call her best girl

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:40.840
The rest are all my concubines!

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:42.160
Oh, man…!

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:45.220
Nice, all are beautiful, nice, nice...

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:46.420
So!

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:51.240
I've decided who will be my temporary wife, so I want to go out together!

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:56.760
Although, it's just that going out in this world is a little dangerous

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:58.920
But it's okay!

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:02.820
I will protect my precious girl!

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:05.240
So, without delay, let's go!

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:06.500
"Let's begin!"

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:08.560
About how to do combat...

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:11.300
Until you put into operation the combat strategy

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:14.260
There exists this thing called "Cooldown Timer"

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:17.920
I think it goes like 5, 4, 3, 2...

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:19.440
But time stops...

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:22.880
You need MP to use skills

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:26.440
I think it shows MP here

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:30.860
This will be the number of MP

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:33.760
And then...

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:36.560
The longer the wait is for MP...

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:39.600
The more effective attacks you can launch

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:43.380
But that's not to say you can just use big moves...

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:46.560
You have to watch the timing of your opponent’s attacks and your allies' attacks….

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:49.980
If it's the same timing, when the timing that your enemies’ attack ends...

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:53.580
It’s better to use skills that activates faster than the enemies’

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:56.460
That means planning is an essential part of this game, right?

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:59.840
And this upper left mark that's like "whoosh"

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:02.520
Those are what makes physical attacks
*Physical Attacks*

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:04.800
And those that have a marking upwards...
*Buff*

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:06.840
Are those that have helpful spells
*Buff*

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:09.680
And those that have a cross mark can cure
*Cure*

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:13.500
*The next one! The next one!*

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:14.520
"Boss"!

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:17.580
"Boss"!

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:20.020
Here I go!

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:26.980
Go for it!

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:28.340
My precious girls!

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:32.600
I want to cast a spell

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:38.680
Ah, but, can I do it?

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:43.340
Eh? But...

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:44.040
It’s hard...

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:45.700
The boss is definitely hard...

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:49.300
I’ll cast a spell...

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:51.560
That way, I’ll have a double enchantment, right?

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:53.260
Good!

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:58.580
Go for it!

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:01.100
It’s very hard, right?

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:02.140
Eeeh?

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:03.040
AH!

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:06.220
Aaah!

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:07.840
It’s unfair!

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:09.580
Just a bit more!

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:13.580
Ah!

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:14.340
Mmm?

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:15.800
It got mad...

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:17.080
It’s angry

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:19.520
Ah! Did he flee?

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:21.200
You cheater!

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:23.800
Here is where...

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:26.260
Ah, wait, wait, I don’t have enough MP

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:27.660
"Mana absorption"!

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:28.760
*Mana Absorption: Possible to steal Mana from your enemies*

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:32.060
By using the "Mana Absorption", I can steal a bit of MP from the enemy

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:33.120
Yaaaay!

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:35.400
Right?

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:38.280
This skill called "Valkyria Flames" is very powerful

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:39.520
I plan to use it...

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:40.780
Against the boss...

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:42.320
"One"!

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:43.920
Let’s go!

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:46.840
*Come here!*

00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:49.740
Yes, how cute

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:53.200
Ah!

00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:54.220
How hard...

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:56.580
Ah, I remember that I have "Musou"!

00:07:56.620 --> 00:08:00.740
This mode "Musou", activates after using various skills

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:03.720
This is how "Musou" mode is activated...

00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:05.960
By being in "Musou" mode...

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:07.880
You can recover a large amount of MP...

00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:08.980
The waiting time is reduced by half...

00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:10.660
As well as the cooldown for skills...

00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:14.700
And that way, you can attack constantly, going "Bam, bam!"

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:22.500
I want to use my "Valkyria Flames" again!

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:26.100
Mmm...

00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:27.200
Can I do it? Ah, wait!

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:30.300
Don’t attack them! I want to deal the final blow, alright?

00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:31.200
Listen...

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:34.880
Let’s go!

00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:38.220
Yaay! It was perfect! I’m a genius!

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:42.840
Well...

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:45.660
Since it’s me, this is a piece of cake, right?

00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:48.500
Man, what do you think of my harem?

00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:49.580
Man, nevertheless...

00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:53.340
Expanding my harem with only my power is quite hard

00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:55.460
Also, I’m not very efficient, right?

00:08:55.460 --> 00:08:56.600
So then...

00:08:56.600 --> 00:09:02.620
I was thinking of creating a guild in which only cute characters can enter

00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:04.240
For now, in this world...

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:06.680
There is a lot of adorable girls, so then...

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:09.380
I plan on gathering all of them with avarice

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:10.840
Good, having said that...

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:12.500
I will say goodbye...

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:14.940
With my wife Cassandra-chan

00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:16.860
Well, even though all of them are like my wives...

00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:19.220
This was Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai!

00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:20.760
See you later!

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:21.860
Yes, how cute!

00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:24.640
Bye!
*What do you want me to prophesize?*
