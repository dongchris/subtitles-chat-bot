00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:01.780
Welcome to today's episode!

00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:04.180
It's virtual youtuber Kizuna Ai!

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:08.280
I know it's a bit sudden, but do you
know what's coming up in 4 years?

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.060
That's right! The Olympics!

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:16.320
At this year's Rio Olympics,
Japan won a record 41 medals!

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.840
I want to go to the Olympics too!

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:24.960
There are a lot of virtual beings
and digital beings like me, right?

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:30.260
I was thinking we could hold a "Virtualympic" together!

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.340
To get this going, we would first need to come up with some events, right?

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.080
You guys may also have noticed, but the background today is different!

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:40.860
Today~~

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:42.600
it's not plain white!

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.680
So today I'm going to start a new Olympic tradition here!

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:49.880
Namely: "car destruction"!

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:51.580
The rules are simple:

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.080
Within the time limit, I will...

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:56.180
destroy this... CAR!

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:58.360
Lets go!

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:02.540
[Don't try this at home, kids!]

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.940
This thing's pretty sturdy, is it even breaking?
I've hit it a bunch of times...

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:12.740
Yes! I'm making progress! I'm getting a feel for this!

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.300
I'm definitely a genius!

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.320
This is pretty tiring...
I'll start by ripping this door apart like cardboard!

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:24.280
Wow! This is amazing! I can do this!
I can make it within the time limit!

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.340
Wait... I'm runing out of time...

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.380
Kick! Kick!

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:30.180
[timer bell]

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.820
Wait, is my time up? But I haven't finished yet...

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.080
Isn't the time limit a bit too short?

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.320
Well, it's my first time and all...

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.900
I did pretty well, right?

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.920
I'm not tired... not at all... since I'm an AI.
Not tired at all.

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.280
This car... 
it's sturdier than I thought~~

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:51.080
Rather, aren't I impressive?
I did this barehanded?! Just my fists!

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.500
I guess it'll require daily training.

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:56.640
Or improving my strength

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.840
It would've been nice...
if I had made it in time~~

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.620
But.. it's a good result for being barehanded~~

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.240
I'm proud of my result~~
Um... what's that? Something like hidden powers?

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:08.400
Like this! Like-

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:11.420
[...]

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.380
Like... this!

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.880
Eh?

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:19.480
Uh...?

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:20.920
Did I just...

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.900
Eh?

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.280
Like kamehame-HA!
[censor beep due to copyright]

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:28.940
It...worked...?

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:32.920
HADOUKEN!

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.040
It really DID work!
