Hello everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai here!

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:05.100
Today is October 31st!

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:06.440
It's the last day of October!

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:09.940
To tell you the truth, I’ve been putting up short videos everyday on my Facebook...

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:12.580
And in my social network channels during the month of October

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.580
I wonder if there’s someone who checked them

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:16.940
So then, today...!

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.400
I’ve been compiling all those daily videos...!

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.380
And I plan to reminisce the month of October!

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.380
In this case, this is the calendar for the month of October, Kizuna Ai style!

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:26.160
Onward!

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.080
Tooou!

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:29.960
October 1st!

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:31.960
October starts from today!

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.940
Let's keep it up and go!

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:38.660
♪ Today... What day is today? ♪

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.440
Today is October 2nd...

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.080
International Non-violence day!

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:44.880
No fighting! In any way!

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.540
October 3rd!

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.020
There’s only 2 months for the year to end, right?

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:51.160
Man, that’s fast

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:53.120
Time passed really quickly, huh!

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.260
Very, very speedy!

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.360

Today...

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:03.640
It seems to be “World Animal Day”

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:04.920
Nyaaann!

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:06.100
Nyan! Nyan!

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:07.640
Everyone!

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.560
Do you know what day it is?

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.760
Eh?

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:11.980
You don't know?

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:14.060
Useless human

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:17.960
Today's October 5th

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:19.820
October 6th!

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:21.880
The week is ending soon

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.080
Everyone worked hard today!

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.040
Good job! Good, good, good, good, good

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.140
Please take a good rest in the weekend

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.720
Good job!

Let's do our best together!

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.860
October 9th!

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.860
Today is World Post Day!

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.660
It's the day when the Universal Postal Union was established!

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:59.340
A letter arrived from Mr. White goat...

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.660
Mr. Black goat doesn't read it and...

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:07.240
October 10th

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.480
Today is Tuna Day!

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:10.900
In this case, starting from now...

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:12.800
I’ll do the Tuna dissection show

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:14.660
I can't!

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.180
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.820
Today's October 11th!

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.260
There's only half of the week left unexpectedly

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.760
Let's continue with our best with what's left of it!

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.600
October 12th

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.640
Today is "Columbus Day"!

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.360
Here's one of Columbus’ famous quotes

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.580
"It's difficult to start anything at first"

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.920
It's the same for a Virtual YouTuber, right?

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.140
October 13th!

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.620
Today is the last day of the week!

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.500
Any work left that needs doing?

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:46.620
Really?

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.260
You shouldn't leave anything for next week!

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.820
Let's do our best until the day is over!

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:51.740
Yaaaay!

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:57.960
October 14th

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.980
Today is “World Standards Day”

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:02.920
"World Standards Day"

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.260
It's the day in which celebrate the efforts of people...

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:11.520
Who contribute to forming international standards like the ISO, IEC y ITU organizations

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:12.340
Yaaaay!

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.200
I also...

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.140
Want to become an international standard

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:20.860
Sunday!

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:22.400
October 15th!

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:24.780
Today is the anniversary of the Gregorian calendar!

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:26.100
Did you know?

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.040
It's the day when everyone in the world started using the actual calendar

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.180
I’ll imitate Gregorio XIII

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.780
One year has 365 days

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:37.620
It's decideeeeeed!

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.240
October 16th!

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:42.240
Today is international food day!

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:43.640

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:47.440
Please make sure to eat your food appropriately

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:49.900
Let's do our best this week too!

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:51.840
October 17th!

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:54.040
You there, who looks a little tired!

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.920
How about watching some A.I.Channel?

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:57.900
I’m sure it'll help get rid of your fatigue!

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:00.160
October 18th!

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:04.000

October 19th!

00:04:10.385 --> 00:04:11.385
I’m sorry!

00:04:12.065 --> 00:04:14.315
Today, A.I.Channel will be having a day off

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.060
However...

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.660
I plan to put up a video in A.I.Games, so then...

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.240
If you want, please watch it

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:21.880

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.440
Good job for everyone who worked this week!

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:27.360
I wonder what you’ll have planned for the weekend

00:04:27.795 --> 00:04:30.575
I want to play again with all of you!

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:10.740
Today is United Nations Day

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:12.940
"United Nations Day"

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:20.300
It seems that the members of the United Nations are advised to commemorate this day as a public holiday, but...

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:23.100
Are you all resting?

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:24.740
What does this mean?

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:28.080
Having said that, today is October 25th

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:29.980
What do you think of my "tsukkomi"?
(Phrase used during jokes to correct someone)

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:31.060
It was good, right?

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:33.620
October 26th!

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:36.560
It's the turning point of this week

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:37.620
Let's do our best!

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:40.220
October 27th!

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:42.580
Thank God it's Friday!

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:45.080
You guys worked hard this week too, right?

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:45.960
Good job!

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:47.980
October 28th!

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:51.100
Only 4 days left for October to end

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.160
I don't want it to end

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:54.880
October 29th!

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:56.800
The week is now over!

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:57.840
So then...

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:01.340
Today I’ll be saying goodbye to the Kansai dialect

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:03.180
You’ll miss it, right?

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:04.960
Let's see again

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:07.060
October 30th!

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:09.840
There’s only 2 days left for October to end!

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:14.160
Let's do our best during the last period, don’t leave anything unfinished

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:15.960
Of course, today is...

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:17.300
“First Love Day”

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:19.400
October 31st!

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:20.780
Happy Halloween!

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:22.620
Having said that...

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:24.560
If you don't watch my videos...

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:26.380
I’ll do a trick on you!

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:28.600
Thanks October!

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:30.600
Nice to meet you November!
