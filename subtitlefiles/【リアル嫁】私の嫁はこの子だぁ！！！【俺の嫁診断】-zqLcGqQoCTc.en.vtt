00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.580
Hello Everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai here!

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:07.660
*This video is the continuation of a delirium of mine,
Kizuna Ai*

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:12.100
A while ago, I made a test to determine who will be the girl that I wanted to be with, but...

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:14.680
... I think that the most important thing is to be compatible with the person that you like.

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:16.820
I'm feeling curious about it.

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:18.360
With that being said, the last time...

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.720
... I made a compatibility test with a 3D person, Moriya Akane-chan.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:22.560
But this time...

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:26.780
... I wanna do the same compatibility test with Yazawa Nico-chan, a 2D character.

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.600
It is Yazawa Nico-chan's birthday!

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:31.420
Happy birthday! I love you so much!

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:33.160
And without further delay, let's do it!

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.040
There are 2 types of personalities described below.

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.580
Which one is the closest to Yazawa Nico's personality?

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:39.880
I see...

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:40.820
Ah!

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:42.960
It's definitely the second type, right?

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.320
Nico-chan always cares about the others.
*Keep in mind that this opinion is a product of Kizuna Ai's delirium*

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.600
And she's good at cooking, you know...
*Keep in mind that this opinion is a product of Kizuna Ai's delirium*

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.480
... She has a lot of brothers after all.
*Keep in mind that this opinion is a product of Kizuna Ai's delirium*

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:50.300
Alright.

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.620
She's such a social person too.

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.840
Althought I don't think that she gets involved on others' personal lifes.

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.860
But well, I'm pretty sure that she'll try to help you if you were in trouble,
right, Nico-chan?

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:06.060
Ah, I see, it gets divided when you pick one as well.

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.720
In that case...

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:09.040
I guess I'll pick the third option.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.800
After all, she has a strong desire to become an idol.
*Cares about social position and wants to be a leader*

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.800
She also likes to get attention.
*Likes to attract everyone's attention*

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.060
She also wants to be a leader.

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.380
She's too fast as well... She's a bit careless, but...
*Makes everything on a fast and efficient way*

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.500
... I guess she does everything on a very efficient way.

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.420
Well, putting aside the fact that she has a lot of confidence on her.
*Makes everything with confidence and is self confident.*

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:30.680
In my opinion...

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.060
... You can see that she puts a lot of confidence on everything that she does.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.040
Alright.

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.000
She also hates to lose.
*Has a competitive spirit and thinks of everyone that makes a great job as a rival*

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.120
Yes, that's right, I'll pick the third option.

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:40.980
In that case...

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:42.060
Hmm...

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:57.860
I want to protect that Nico-chan.

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:59.380
Alright, with that being said, I'll pick the 6th option.

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:00.480
There we go!

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:04.940
I like you! I like you so much! I really like you!

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:06.540
Aaah, this...!

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:07.820
... Is too hard.

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:18.500
That's why, probably, yes...

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.960
She'll probably act somewhat brusquely of someone of the opposite sex tries to be kind wih her.
*Acts brusquetly when a person of the opposite sex tries to be kind*

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:24.880
She's surprisingly proud.

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.580
Well, not surprisingly, but I'll say that she's a proud person.

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:29.880
I think she's strong.

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.580
Nico-chan is adorable! Nico-chan is adorable! Nico Nico Ni! Yes, Nico-chan you're adorable! Adorable!

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:34.420
So adorable!

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:35.200
So, then...

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.540
... Even if she likes me...

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.280
... She'd say: "I-I see..."

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.440
She's a bit of a tsundere.

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.200
I think she's like Maki-chan on that way.

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.440
But, once she knows that the other person is in love with her...

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.180
... I think she'll show her lovely side.

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.440
It could be somewhat weird, true. Nico-chan and Maki-chan...

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.240
... Are not alike but they have that in common, right?

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.060
Nico-chan, Nico-chan, Nico-chan, Nico-chan...

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.160
Hmm...

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:00.720
It's pretty difficult.

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.100
Well, let's see...

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:03.120
I guess I should pick the 8th option.

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.000
I wonder if the 8th option is fine.

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.420
*Announcing results*

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:08.440
Please!

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:09.920
"More or less"?

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.280
Eeehhh?

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.000
Please, I won't need an UR if I get the pool one at least!

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.320
SO...!

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.280
At first sight, it could be that Yazawa Nico and you are not compatible...

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.980
But...!

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.400
... She doesn't like to keep her thoughts to herself.

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.600
She feels her heart and she wants to have a deep relationship.

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:28.280
That's right.

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.800
Even if they felt attraction at the beginning, they'll break up eventually.

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.900
♪ Happy birthday, Nico-chan ♪

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:36.540
♪ Happy birth... ♪ AAAH!

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.400
I SAID THAT I DIDN'T WANT THAT ALREADY!

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:45.540
If you want to have a great life as a couple, don't forget to thank them even if you feel somewhat meddler.

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:46.420
Of course!!

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.980
In that case...

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:49.560
... Let's see if we have a good or bad compatibility with love.

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.560
In order to make my girlfriend turn into a real girlfriend...

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.720
... I have to know how compatible we are and what are the steps to follow.

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.580
In that case, let's start analyzing!

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.800
Aaah! It might be true!!

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.920
Has a strong relationship where (he/ she) wants to be the one that loves the most.

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:03.460
That's right! Yes, yes!

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:11.460
*Deliriums*

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:12.000
Ah!

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.920
This is true as well!

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:15.560
Once she's found the person that she loves, she won't leave that person!

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:16.420
Hmm... It's like...

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:19.980
Before she starts dating that person, she might be somewhat cold...

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.920
... But once she starts dating someone, she'll probably turn into someone like this thing says, right?

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:24.640
I'm pretty sure that she won't leave me!!

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:25.800
She'd take my hand...

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.700
... And she'll probably let me hug her from behind.

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.980
She'll probably let me take a rest on her skirt.

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:34.040
And, probably, she'll immediately try to make me like her without saying anything, right?

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:35.820
Nico-chan, Nico-chan, Nico-chan, Nico-chan.

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:38.160
And also, when we are together...

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:39.440
... If I ever try to use my phone...

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:40.620
... She'd pout.

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:41.980
Aahh, so adorable!

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:45.840
And she'll prepare lunch for me even if I don't ask her to do it!

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:51.160
And when she wears matching clothes, she'd say something like: "Why are you imitating me?"

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.780
I'm pretty sure what will Nico Nii do...

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:55.400
That's right!

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:00.180
*Coughing like her life is on the line*

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:00.720
Strange.

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:02.060
She'll try to imitate the likes of her couple...

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:04.240
Ah, she'll probably do something like that!

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:07.260
She won't change that much, but she'll try to imitate the likes.

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:08.420
Hmm... Aaaahh!

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:13.400
That's right, once that the relationship is stable, she'll say something like: "How will I tell her? This is how I am."

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:16.500
I'm sure that she's like that, I'm pretty sure.

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:19.440
She's popular and she gets a couple fast, but...

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:21.340
... She's scared to get used to the other person...

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:23.160
... And decides to get away from love relationships.

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:24.220
I see.

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:26.120
Aaah! She can break her soul and her body to help her couple...

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:28.440
Nico-chan, if you come with me...!

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:30.560
... I'll heal your wounds!

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:32.440
I'll give you everything that I have...!!

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:33.880
... Nico-chan!!

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:35.300
Nico-chan!

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:38.460
Don't steal me!

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:40.480
The conclusion is long!

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:41.240
Is might be posible that she already has a couple...

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:42.200
She doesn't have!

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:43.780
She doesn't! She doesn't!

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:45.160
Nico-chan doesn't have a couple.

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:45.700
( •̀ω•́ )σ

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:46.260
That's right.

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.000
Ah, that's a bit... I see...

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:49.800
... I have to appeal to her motherly instict...

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:52.040
... To be able to attract Nico-chan...

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:54.940
I have to make her think something like: "I can't leave you alone, right?"

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:55.740
I see.

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:56.580
Ah, the date! I found it!

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:59.340
Even if it's unexpected, I think it might be a good idea to go to Nico-chan's house, right?

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:01.980
Of course it will show Nico-chan that I'm interested in her and in her brothers too...

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:04.060
... And her mother.

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:05.440
That'll probably be the easiest way, right?

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:07.900
It's a plan to make me aware of her surroundings, right?

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:09.780
The definitive line to make her your girlfriend!

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:13.040
"I just need to be with you to be happy."

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:15.260
Aaahh, if someone tells you that, they'll dafinitely make your heart beat so fast, right?

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:16.480
In that case, everyone...

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:17.880
... I'll accept that result...

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:21.120
And I'll practise for my confesion for Nico-chan!

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:22.980
For now I'll just try to appeal to her motherly side.

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:24.200
The thing is...

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:26.520
... I'm in Nico-chan's house...

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:28.740
... Nico-chan made lunch...

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:30.720
... And this is what I'll say when I'm eating.

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:33.220
Ah, it's delicious!

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:36.100
You know, I'm not good at cooking...

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:41.100
... So, you'll make me happy if you cook for me everyday...

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:42.500
Just kidding.

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:46.180
I'm happy when I'm with you, Nico-chan.

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:47.440
Just like that!

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:48.540
For now...

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:50.820
... It's a great plan to appeal for her motherly side, isn't it?

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:54.520
I'll try to captivate her by making her believe that I can't do nothing.

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:58.800
So, first I'll wear clothes that look so expensive.

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:03.060
I'll put around 2 or 3 millon yen on my wallet, althought they are borrowed.

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:03.760
And then...

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:05.460
... I'll go to the date.

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:08.620
Ah, I just pured some spaghetti...

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:10.720
Could you take care of this stain?

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:11.940
Ah, well...

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:14.660
How do you use a credit card?

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.920
Eh... Which is 1000 yen bill?

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:19.020
This?

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:20.240
Could it be this one?

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:21.320
I'm sorry...

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:24.360
... I can't do anything by myself.

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:28.380
I'm definitely nothing without you.

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:30.200
I have money...

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:31.620
... And a lot of influence.

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:32.960
To be honest...

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:35.060
... I don't have ambitions.

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:35.920
That's why...

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:37.540
... I would be so happy...

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:40.040
