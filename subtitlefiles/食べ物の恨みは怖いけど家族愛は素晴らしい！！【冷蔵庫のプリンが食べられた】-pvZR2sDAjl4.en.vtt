00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:02.880
Hello everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna AI here!

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:04.910
Today, I wanted to try this app

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:05.630
Tada!

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:07.870
"My brother ate my pudding"

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:10.290
For starters, what a funny title

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.880
Also, this brings memories from Inside’s Mario character, right?

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:14.640
If you ask me what kind of game it is

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:18.920
The sister screams: "My pudding is missing from the fridge!"

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:21.330
She gets really mad and chases her little brother

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.340
I’m her little brother

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:24.940
And the game consists in trying to escape successfully

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:26.510
“Seeing is believing!”

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.560
In that case, I’ll start immediately!

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:32.520
Pudding

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:34.340
I got pudding!

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.310
It looks delicious

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.760
Is it good?

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:42.480
“The following day”

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:45.500
Not here!

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:46.380
Not here!

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:47.290
Not here!

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:48.890
Not here!

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.220
Not just the pudding is gone...
[My pudding’s gone!]

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:53.370
There are no drinks either…
[Someone ate my pudding from the fridge]

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:54.250
Start!

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.660
Eh? I wonder if these kind of quarrels between brother and sister happen often in reality

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:03.060
What’s this?

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:04.870
Ah! The curtains opened

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:05.730
Like this?

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:09.380
Ah!

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:13.440
[Hooray]

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.050
This sister is dumb, huh?

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:16.280
This might go well

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.530
And?

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:18.940
This bookcase-- ah!

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:20.440
The books can be removed

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:24.580
Wait, I can't put back the books?

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:26.360
Of course you'd be spotted!

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:28.160
[Damn it!]

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:29.280
"Damn it" is right

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.980
Eh?

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:31.300
What should I do?

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:34.030
Ahh!

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.020
Hide under the books!

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:41.040
Isn’t that more suspicious instead?

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:43.130
For this...

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:46.750
Get in there! Try your best!

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.500
“Damn it” is right

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:50.320
Ah!

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:51.040
This--

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:52.090
You can pan horizontally

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:54.670
I got an item!

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:56.240
What’ll I do?

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:58.870
And then do this… newspaper… what about the newspaper?

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:59.370
Huh?

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:02.090
What?

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:04.690
Do I need to use the newspaper?

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.820
Got a newspaper

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:09.560
Put it over there...

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:11.450
Ahh! So it’s like that!

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.540
I won’t get spotted if she thinks I’m their dad

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:15.230
What’s this?

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:17.060
What is this?

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:19.820
I’d get busted like this

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.700
The blue one

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:22.400
OK!

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:27.340
Great! Wasn’t spotted

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:29.060
This sister is truly worthless

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.660
Eh?

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.520
Thi- haha

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.120
I’d unexpectedly caught more easily compared to the books

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.750
What’s here?

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.800
Got an item

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:47.180
Eh?

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:48.090
Like this

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:50.340
It was opposite!?

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:51.320
Gramps

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.880
Eh, what should I do?

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:54.660
Ah, this

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:57.540
Use it like this

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:59.140
Ahh!

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:00.150
No wa… haha

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:02.100
I get it, haha

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:03.180
Seriously?

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:04.520
There’s something on the wall...

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.610
And this?

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:08.050
With the bat...

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.030
I can smash a hole in here

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:11.160
How true

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.860
I’m sorry, Mama

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:13.830
Oh, remove this...

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:15.000
And enter

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:17.150
Great!

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.920
Nice, nice

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.430
Doing things simply is good!

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:25.340
Got a chair

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:26.770
Eh?

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:29.400
What’s this?

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:30.240
Ah, I know

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:35.110
Not like this, Gramps...

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:37.730
Huh?
So I’ll take the chair

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:39.560
And this

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.680
Do I have to pretend I’m the person who counts?

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:43.400
See?

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:44.810
Yeah, like that

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:50.070
Though it’s inside the house

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:51.750
And this?

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:53.090
Nothing’s here

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:56.780
Oh!

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:59.700
As expected

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:01.000
I did it!

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:04.940
I just need to hide inside the blankets, right?

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:09.080
Hieeeee...

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.690
I’ve got it!

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:10.570
If I do this...

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:14.360
Nothing happens if I open the curtains, right?

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:15.600
No no, I messed up…

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:16.530
I blundered...

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:18.820
A mistake, of course I’ll get busted...

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.570
I’ll enter the futon and turn off the lights!

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:22.640
I can’t turn off… the lights

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:24.090
I can’t turn off the lights

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:25.070
How about this?

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:26.450
Huh?

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:28.320
Of course!

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:30.620
Open it, then hide inside

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:35.060
He changed the way of hiding!

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:40.840
Ahh it changes based on where I push!

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:41.490
Like that, huh?

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:43.210
I see

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:45.460
Where you hide in the futon can change!

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:46.840
And now...

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:48.600
What’s this?

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:49.090
Ah!

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:50.600
Is this like “Demons out!”
(In Japan people throw beans to keep demons away)

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:51.780
I’ll give it to this dove

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:56.560
Oh

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:58.380
It was like that?

00:04:58.670 --> 00:04:59.170
Eh...

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:01.060
Grab this

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:01.810
Open this

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:03.150
And scatter the seeds here

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:05.920
Ah!

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:07.150
Flawless!

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:09.620
I mean, I still don’t get it!

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:10.670
Ordinarily you’d be spotted!

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:12.620
What is this?

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:14.030
A carrot

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:16.600
Ahh!

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:17.320
A giraffe!

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:21.810
Huh?

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:22.400
Heh

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:25.640
Ahhhh

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:28.020
I’ll take the carrot

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:29.140
And...

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:30.400
put it here?

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:31.250
Here?

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:31.940
No good...

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:33.210
I guess, definitely here

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:35.340
Ah! Like this!

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:36.310
Perfect!

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:37.130
I don’t get it

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:39.000
A giraffe there in the first place is weird!

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:40.920
Oh?

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:41.710
Who are they?

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:45.200
Oh! Let’s hang!

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:46.990
Hey!! Yo!!

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:51.860
Huh… what do you mean?

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:54.150
I grab the ball, right?

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:56.120
Yep! And hand it to the dudes!

00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:58.910
That was all bad!!

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:01.420
I’ll give it to the referee

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:03.490
Oh! Ah!

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:03.950
I can only jump once?

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:04.950
Ah! I see

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:05.870
Alright! Here I come!

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:07.560
Let’s play ball!

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:08.060
C’mon c’mon!

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:10.030
Hoi!

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:11.840
Ahhh!! Haaah!!

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:12.740
1, 2!

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:14.810
Go!

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:15.960
Ahhh!! Haaah!!

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:17.190
Yeah! Come on!

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:19.020
Yo! I’m a basketball bro

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:20.360
I…

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:22.580
If I take the ball

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:24.090
Wah! Hehheh!

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:27.360
Oh! Did you know? Round here, round these parts

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:28.040
I’m a…

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:30.130
Famous junior high student

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:31.370
Basket… bas...

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:32.870
(Exasperated laugh)

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:35.040
I’m a junior high school student...

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:37.940
...Considering your physical contexture you’re a senior high school student, right?

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:38.880
Please go easy on me

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:39.560
Yes!

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:40.760
What the heck!?

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:41.900
Why?

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:43.660
How rude! The jerks!

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:44.850
Endless basketball...

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:45.720
And, go!

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:46.340
OK!

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:47.100
WHY!?

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:49.010
OK, OK, OK!

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:49.850
Ah! Good, good, good!

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:51.350
Eh? Really? Really? Really?

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:52.040
What should I do? What should I do? What should I do?

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:53.540
Ah, it’s like that

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:55.790
I did it!

00:06:56.630 --> 00:06:57.610
Bowling...

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.120
There’s bowling...

00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:02.870
Oh, this is perfect!

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:03.570
Ahh! I got it!

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:05.110
I did it!

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:07.070
What is this?

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:10.050
Eh?

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:14.360
Suddenly like Doraemon?

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:17.140
Use these...

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:18.760
Like this…

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:19.710
And this...

00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:20.360
This, like so!

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:23.090
Get in!

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:29.070
Oh!

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:30.680
I got it! It’s like Sazae-san!

00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:31.970
This--

00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:32.470
Ah!

00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:34.120
That thing you dropped was...

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:38.080
Well...

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:39.440
...I only picked it up

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:41.880
I should throw the ax into the lake, right?

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:44.980
Eh?

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:46.320
I’m very sorry!

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:48.000
Eh... in this case, the ticket...

00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:50.760
Meeehhhh!?

00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:52.120
Ah! Now I got it!

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:54.300
With the ax, I should cut the bamboo! Right?

00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:55.340
I’ll cut the bamboo

00:07:56.700 --> 00:07:57.200
And now?

00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:58.060
I’ll throw it into the lake

00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:00.920
Ah! I see! I see!

00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:04.600
This way, I won’t be found out!

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:06.480
An elastic bed...

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:09.640
Poyoooon

00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:10.700
Poyoooon poyooon

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:11.760
Poyooon

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:13.140
Poyooon

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:14.380
Poyooon

00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:15.880
Poyooon

00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:17.400
Poyooon

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:18.880
Poyooon

00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:20.480
Poyooon

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:22.480
Ooohhh!

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:24.680
I see! How far did it go?

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:26.900
Eh? What is... this?

00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:28.040
Some matches

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:29.240
First...

00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:31.180
I’ll fish up a fish!

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:33.480
I’ll fish

00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:35.640
A rubber boot...

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:37.060
It's a rubber boot?

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:38.340
I’ll light the fire

00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:39.880
Roast the rubber boot

00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:42.600
I don’t understand anything of what I just did!

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:47.880
I failed! One more time!

00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:50.420
Ah, can I do it several times until I fish up something?

00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:53.720
The rubber boot… once again!

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:54.860
Again!

00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:56.900
It's too... Oh!

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:57.600
Ah!

00:08:58.200 --> 00:08:58.760
I was able to fish up something!

00:08:58.760 --> 00:08:59.500
With this...

00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:00.520
...I’ll roast the Pacific saury

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:04.380
And now I can hide behind the smoke

00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:05.840
I did it perfectly! Right?

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:06.340
In fact...

00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:09.660
The pudding... is tasty but I’m sure that fish is too, Nee-chan!

00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:10.540
Very good!

00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:11.780
I’m doing very well

00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:12.280
DS...

00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:14.100
Ah! Hey! Hey! Hey! Wait! Wait! Wait!

00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:15.960
Mamma...!

00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:17.240
Mamma... mia!

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:19.960
Mama is here, right?

00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:21.380
Eh?

00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:24.920
Eh? Can’t I pick up the DS?

00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:26.600
I can’t pick it up

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:27.240
Mmm...

00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:28.400
Nya!! 🐱

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:29.440
You shouldn’t enter here!

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:30.600
I think I understand it now!

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:31.940
Up here, there's an extra button, right?

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:35.560
What do you think of that?

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:37.820
I did it!

00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:40.080
Mmm...?

00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:43.120
Eh?

00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:44.560
Eh?

00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:47.580
Eh?

00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:50.660
Ah? Aaah!?

00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:51.820
What do you suppose I should do!?

00:09:56.660 --> 00:09:58.480
Ah! Somehow they did it themselves

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:00.800
There's a puddle of water

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:01.640
Should I enter?

00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:02.200
Will I die?

00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:05.100
Ah, is that all?

00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:06.140
Eh?

00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:10.260
Is Onee-chan worried?

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:13.800
Mmm...?

00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:17.020
Ah?

00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:24.820
Onee-taaan!

00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:32.620
Should I have brought the matches with me?

00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:36.720
Mmm...?

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:37.740
Mmmmmmmm...?

00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:38.640
What's going on? What's going on?

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:39.780
Ah! Ah! Ah!

00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:40.420
I got it!

00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:42.960
I need to find the necessary item

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:45.100
Maybe the fishing pole...?

00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:45.600
The mat...

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:47.200
Do I need the fishing pole and the matches?

00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:49.520
Eeehh?

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:52.280
Is that all?

00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:54.580
A cat?

00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:56.720
Meow! How adorable! Right?

00:10:57.920 --> 00:10:59.740
Will it follow me?

00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:01.040
How adorable!

00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:04.060
Mama?

00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:08.020
Ah, suddenly there’s more people

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:10.500
Grandpa!?

00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:11.500
Wake up!

00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:16.900
I should give him the matches, right?

00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:18.420
I’ll also give the ax

00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:20.000
How about now!?

00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:23.760
And now I’ll pick up the items...

00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:25.980
And I should burn them with the matches, right?

00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:27.400
Oh!

00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:28.760
And I’ll break it with the ax!

00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:31.720
Ah! There’s a rope!

00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:35.000
Oh! Incredible, right?

00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:41.260
Oh!

00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:43.680
Pull! Pull!

00:11:43.820 --> 00:11:45.940
PULL! PULL!

00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:52.920
He’s being pulled from above

00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:54.460
Oh!

00:11:56.340 --> 00:11:57.240
I did it!

00:11:58.720 --> 00:11:59.500
[ Congratulations! Successful Escape! ]

00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:00.000
Ah!
[ Congratulations! Successful Escape! ]

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:00.580
[ Congratulations! Successful Escape! ]

00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:02.060
It says I successfully escaped!
[ Congratulations! Successful Escape! ]

00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:03.100
I did it!
[ Congratulations! Successful Escape! ]

00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:04.720
Good! Having said that...

00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:07.560
I tried to play "My brother ate my pudding" but...!

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:08.500
It was a lot of fun!

00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:09.380
Man...

00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:13.660
...Human beings are capable of chasing anyone who’s eaten their pudding, right?

00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:16.720
But well, lastly, it’s about a family, so then...

00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:20.400
Being able to get along even in that kind of crisis...

00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:22.200
Human beings are marvelous!

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:23.940
This app was a lot of fun, so then...

00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:26.440
...I’d like to play this kind of game again

00:12:26.490 --> 00:12:29.160
This was from Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai!

00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:30.250
See you later!

00:12:31.490 --> 00:12:34.260
We need more translators!
