00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:03.680
In the name of the moon, I’ll punish you!

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:06.520
Hello everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna AI here!

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:09.560
Everyone! Do you know Pretty Soldier Sailor Moon?

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:11.080
Of course you know it, right?

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:11.980
Right?

00:00:11.985 --> 00:00:14.815
Man, I really like the original saga, but...

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.340
...Sailor Moon Super...

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:18.020
...And Sailor Moon SuperS...

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:20.420
...Well, I like the series in its entirety...!!

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:21.280
But within the series...

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:24.940
...I like Chibiusa-chan, Pegaso, Hotaru-chan!!

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:26.220
I like the relationship they have...

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.380
Man, Chibiusa’s pure heart... her heart of a young woman... right?

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.420
I like her and she's so adorable

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:34.080
And also...

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:35.300
In Sailor Moon S, there appears warriors outside of the Solar System...

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:35.800
...Hotaru-chan appears...

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.120
And in SuperS, well, Chibiusa and Pegasus are part of the main story

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.440
And they're also appears the enemies of the Circus!

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:39.820
Man, really...!!

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:41.200
...I love Sailor Moon!

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:42.440
Having said that, today...

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.980
... I intend to do a pilgrimage of Sailor Moon!

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:47.000
In this case, let's start at once!

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.700
First off, let's start here, Ja jhaaaan!

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:51.340
The Hikawa temple!!

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.060
The Hikawa Temple appears within the story, right?

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.840
This is the temple where Hino Rei, who transforms into Sailor Mars, works as a priestess!

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.940
I’d also want to be purified...

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:04.060
Man...

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:07.100
Well, at first glance, Rei-chan doesn't appear very sociable, but...

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.440
...She’s like an older sister who worries a lot about others...

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.560
...And well, it's like she’d definitely scold you for doing something you shouldn't have

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:13.240
Scold me

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:15.960
In the name of Mars, I'll punish you!

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:17.700
Continuing on, the next place!

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.820
"Arisugawanomiyakinen Park"

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.440
This part was taking as reference for the place where Usagi-chan and Mamoru-san had a date, right?

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.700
Man... Usagi-chan really loves Mamoru-san! Right?

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.180
I also, at least once...

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.740
No, well, I think that would ruin the appearance of their world, but...

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.300
… At least once, I’d like to turn into Mamoru and...

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:40.540
… Receive a hug from Usagi-chan and Chibiusa-chan... a hug...

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.580
"Moon Prism power! Make Up!"

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:46.320
The next place will be this!

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:47.300
Dooon!

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:48.560
"The Kimi-chan statue"!

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.080
It's that little one that you can see in the background, right?

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.800
Next to that statue was where Mizuno Ami-chan, who transforms Sailor Mercury...

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.280
...She asked for advice to Mamoru-san, who was transformed into Tuxedo Mask, right?

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:59.560
Ami-chan is...!

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:01.260
Man...

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:02.480
...Be my private teacher...

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:03.440
...Please

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.540
"Douse yourself in water and repent!"

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:08.460
The next place will be this!

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:09.140
Ey!

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:12.420
"The shop that specializes in kaleidoscopes, Kaleidoscope Mukashi-kan"

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:18.260
This was the store that was taken as reference where Mamoru-san bought a gift for Usagi-chan and Chibiusa-chan!

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.680
"In the name of the future Moon, I'll punish you!"

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:23.740
I'm still not finished!

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:24.380
Jan!

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.560
"Katsura Yumi Bridal House"!

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:32.400
This is the store that was taken as reference to make the scene where Sailor Jupiter, Kino Makoto-chan, make their appearance!

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.260
Mako-chan is... well...!

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.200
A girl that the other girls would fall in love with?

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.100
But, she has a feminine side...

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.980
She’s adorable ♡

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.840
“I'll make you feel so much regret, it’ll leave you numb!"

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.375
The last place that we shouldn't forget is this!

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.120
"Game Center Crown"

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:50.860
This is the place that was used as reference!

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.280
This is the place that was used as reference where Usagi and the rest tended to hang out! Right?

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:56.860
Man, I’d also like...

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:58.720
...To play with them in a game... a fighting game...

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:59.560
Orya, orya, orya!

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:00.320
Something like that

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:01.580
It wouldn't matter to me if I’d wind up getting crushed

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:02.880
They'd let me easily win

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:03.380
Yes

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.360
"The divine punishment of love will fall onto you!"

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:08.300
What do you think?

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:10.800
Was I able to transmit the love I feel for Sailor Moon?

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.880
I’ll live doing what I like!

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.460
This was Virtual YouTuber Kizuna AI!

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:17.640
See you later!
