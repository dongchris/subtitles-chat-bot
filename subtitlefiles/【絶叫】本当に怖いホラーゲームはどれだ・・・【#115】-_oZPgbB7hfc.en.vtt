00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:01.160
Hello...

00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:03.360
Virtual Youtuber Kizuna Ai here...

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:05.460
It's really hot recently isn't it?

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:06.740
And when it's hot out, it really

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:08.320
puts you in the horror mood.

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:09.740
With that said, for todayー!

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:14.400
I'd like to present to you "Which are Ai-chan's scariest games?"

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:15.920
based on my personal judgment and opinions!

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:17.100
With that, let's go!

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.160
How scaryー

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.240
How scaryー

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:21.280
First up is...

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:22.240
"Inside"!

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.760
I've played this on more than one occasion

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:26.200
It's kind of subtly scary

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.140
Like, it doesnt really make me jump

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.960
But like the more you think about the story the darker it gets

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:34.400
This deserves a place!

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:35.320
Aaaaah!

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:36.540
Stop it!

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:37.120
*inhales*

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.520
Hey, Mario..

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:42.820
How many meters can you hold while jumping?

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:45.860
Oh!

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:46.640
Ha, ha, ha..

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:49.220
This is..

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:51.060
*inhales*

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:51.800
I see

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.200
They're double, right?

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:55.300
I'll take it off

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:57.860
Aaaahh! Mario!

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:00.120
Move the box

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:01.800
AaaaAAH!

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:03.900
*inhales*

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:05.120
Mario-chan..

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.620
Ah, wait Mario! Down! Mario!

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:08.400
No, no, no!

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:09.400
Hey wait!

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:10.180
I messed up!

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:11.420
I messed up! I messed up! I messed up!

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:12.780
Eeee-eh..?

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:14.080
Next up is..

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:15.140
"Little Nightmares"!

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.200
It's a game I started playing recently!

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.360
Now because the player character is cute

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.160
I figured it isn't really that scary at first

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.340
Then some weirdー weird mole-looking things started appearing

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.760
Like, it really gets scarier and you progress further

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:30.400
So I look forward to more of it!

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:32.080
Waaaai..! Waaai..!

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:32.660
And now?

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:35.960
Eh? Eh? Eh? Eh?! Eh?!

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.320
This looks dangerous!

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:42.320
Those hands look dangerous!

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:44.280
Uh! Aaaaaah!

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.220
Ah, I scared myself, there's nothing

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.660
Aaaah!

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:49.560
Ah, ah, ah..

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:50.420
*inhales*

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:51.400
Do you die if you fall?

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:52.860
*door closes*

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.620
Aah!

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:56.940
Ah! Ah! AH!

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:58.020
That hurts! There's something..!

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.860
Aaaah! It was useless!

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:02.060
Mother!

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:04.500
AaaaAH!

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:06.180
What are you?!

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:09.880
Ah! Ha! Goodbye!

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:11.040
Goodbye!

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:12.620
Goodbye world!

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:14.220
Last one up is...

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.780
"Resident Evil 7: Biohazard"!

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.060
Ahh this is bad this bad!

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.540
This... I get scared just by looking at the title screen!

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.980
I'm in this white space alone

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.260
playing it in the dark

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.400
Turned off all the lights, playing it alone

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:29.420
I have such a strong mind!

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:32.060
The zombies are friends..

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.180
The zombies are friends..

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:34.300
The zombies are friends..

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:35.420
My friends, BBF!

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:39.880
Ah, there's no one

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:41.000
Good, good!

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.120
Ah, this must be easy peasy, right?

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.040
I'm going out!

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:46.240
Eeh?!

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:48.180
Eh, he!

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.560
Eh?!

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.960
What? What?

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:54.480
Ah, another area appeared!

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:55.940
Truly.. how scary!

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.800
*thud* Ah!

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:58.240
Ha, ha..!

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:00.920
AaaaAAH, cockc-!

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:03.280
Aaah, ha..!

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.880
Eh?!

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.640
What shou... ah, there's a button!

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:07.140
*CRASH*

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:08.700
AAAAGH-AH-AHHGH!

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:12.160
Agh?!

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.700
So then.. slowly..

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:16.920
YAAAH-HAAH?!

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.200
AAAH! Something is bekubebukubaba!

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.820
That scared me..

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:23.680
It moved!

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:24.680
What is this?

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:25.340
*whimper*

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:26.420
Good day..(?)

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:27.920
ARHHHGHHAAA!

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:28.420
NOOO!

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:29.240
It's nasty!!!

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:30.500
NOOO!!

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:31.220
NO! NO!

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:32.100
CLOSE IT!!

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:33.080
CLOSE IT!!

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:34.120
HOW DO I DO THAT?!!

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.620
*inhales*

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:35.720
CLOSE IT!!

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:37.480
GAAH-

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:38.580
I REALLY DON'T WANT TO DO THIS!

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:39.080
*inhales*

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:40.100
Not anymore! *sobs*

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:41.960
IYAAHAAH!

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:42.560
HE DISAPPEARED!

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:43.060
ANDRE!

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:43.960
Wait, where'd he go?

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:45.260
Hey, don't leave me alone!

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:46.980
Don't leave me alone, where are you?!

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:49.780
AAARHGHGHH!

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:50.380
DON'T GO DOWN!!

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:50.880
NO!!

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:51.740
WHY ARE YOU GOING DOWN?!!

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:53.520
(Pete: You first)

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:55.720
No, YOU go first!

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:57.520
No, no, no!

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:59.260
Go!

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:01.460
Hey, why aren't you coming?!

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.160
Hurry up down here, you!

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:06.560
That guy's a real ********

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:07.480
All said and done

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.660
You've seen three different horror games

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:10.640
How was it?

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:13.420
Truly every game was very well-made

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:14.940
They're all really scary, aren't they?

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.280
And the graphics are, like, really nice

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.400
to the point where it's really realistic and eerie

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:22.220
I'm playing those games on A.I. Games

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:23.840
So please check them out if you will!

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:25.060
Eh...?

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:26.400
Something...

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:28.580
Is something watching...?

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.120
Aaaaaah!

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:37.400
