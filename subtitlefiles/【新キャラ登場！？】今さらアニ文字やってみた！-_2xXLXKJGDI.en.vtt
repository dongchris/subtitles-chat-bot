00:00:00.667 --> 00:00:01.801
Hello everyone!

00:00:01.801 --> 00:00:03.703
Virtual~

00:00:03.703 --> 00:00:04.738
dog here!

00:00:04.738 --> 00:00:06.506
Ho~wl!

00:00:06.506 --> 00:00:08.408
You haven't clicked on the wrong channel

00:00:08.408 --> 00:00:09.376
so don't worry!

00:00:09.376 --> 00:00:10.543
Huh?

00:00:10.543 --> 00:00:12.779
This name is... lazy?

00:00:12.779 --> 00:00:14.000
Hmm...

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.248
But

00:00:15.248 --> 00:00:17.217
it's so easy to understand

00:00:17.217 --> 00:00:18.952
so don't you think it sticks?

00:00:18.952 --> 00:00:19.986
Dog

00:00:19.986 --> 00:00:21.800
Virtual... Dog

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:22.789
Well, you know!

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:25.258
If I don't keep coming up with new content

00:00:25.258 --> 00:00:27.660
I can't keep surviving on this platform~!

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:28.328
What...?

00:00:28.328 --> 00:00:29.362
This is...

00:00:29.362 --> 00:00:31.431
old news...?

00:00:31.431 --> 00:00:33.333
Mmm...

00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:34.467
You're lying!

00:00:34.467 --> 00:00:36.170
C'mon, c'mon!

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.940
This is something

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:42.375
I, a super intelligent Virtual Dog,

00:00:42.375 --> 00:00:44.511
researched to find is super cutting edge!

00:00:44.511 --> 00:00:46.413
So you must be lying~

00:00:46.413 --> 00:00:47.080
Right?

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:48.281
Right?

00:00:48.281 --> 00:00:49.115
Right!

00:00:49.115 --> 00:00:50.483
Oi oioioioi!

00:00:50.483 --> 00:00:51.885
What's all this?!

00:00:51.885 --> 00:00:53.353
Virtual Dog...

00:00:53.353 --> 00:00:56.260
what kind of lazy name is that?

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:57.190
You know...

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:58.825
Doesn’t Virtual Pig...

00:00:58.825 --> 00:01:00.093
just sound so much cuter?

00:01:00.093 --> 00:01:03.196
You see, this crease... on my forehead

00:01:03.196 --> 00:01:04.130
is pretty interesting, right?

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:06.580
Nothing like that Virtual Dog has!

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:09.402
These aren't even

00:01:09.402 --> 00:01:11.104
proper names at all!!

00:01:11.104 --> 00:01:11.871
Ah, me?

00:01:11.871 --> 00:01:14.107
My name is~

00:01:14.107 --> 00:01:15.300
My

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:17.250
name is...

00:01:18.411 --> 00:01:19.846
Mr. Pig!

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.660
Huh?

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:24.070
Huh?

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:25.460
This is

00:01:26.186 --> 00:01:27.320
such a good smell!

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.657
Did you change your shampoo?!

00:01:30.657 --> 00:01:33.960
Yesterday I sent you a message on LINE but...

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.962
you must've been sleeping~

00:01:35.962 --> 00:01:37.397
Right~

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:39.966
You were sleeping? Of course~

00:01:39.966 --> 00:01:41.901
And what position did you sleep in?

00:01:41.901 --> 00:01:43.230
Hmm? Ah...!

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.740
So you were sleeping hugging the futon?

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:48.800
Ehe, how cute~!

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:49.509
Well!

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:51.878
There is no particular reason why I asked you that

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:53.350
Right~

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:54.570
it's just

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.010
I wanted to chat with you for a bit!

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.584
Hehe~

00:01:57.584 --> 00:02:00.790
Lately it’s just been like no matter what I say

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:03.150
people keep calling me a sexual harasser...

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:04.960
It’s pretty...

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:06.110
crushing!

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:06.926
Right?

00:02:06.926 --> 00:02:08.862
I’ve gotta live honestly

00:02:08.862 --> 00:02:12.130
ho~nest~ly

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:14.070
for myself, don’t I?

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.800
Huh?

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.369
Oh, by the way

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:17.837
You’ve been

00:02:17.837 --> 00:02:19.172
pretty cute lately...

00:02:19.973 --> 00:02:21.875
Do you have a boyfriend?

00:02:21.875 --> 00:02:22.940
Hikakin
TV

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.170
everyday!

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.030
BOOM BOOM, hello YouTube!

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:29.390
Hello!

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:33.119
This is Hikakin’s granny!

00:02:33.119 --> 00:02:33.953
Hnnn!

00:02:33.953 --> 00:02:35.220
Look, look!

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.922
Take a look!

00:02:35.922 --> 00:02:37.190
My cheeks!

00:02:37.957 --> 00:02:39.125
Hnnn!

00:02:39.893 --> 00:02:42.162
Time for a drumro~ll!

00:02:42.162 --> 00:02:42.890
BOOM BOOM!

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.330
Brbrbrbrbrbr-

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:46.450
CLASH!

00:02:47.066 --> 00:02:47.901
Huh?

00:02:47.901 --> 00:02:49.836
Time for some beatboxing!

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:56.120
Um...

00:02:56.876 --> 00:02:58.144
It’s quite difficult!

00:02:58.144 --> 00:02:59.846
Hikakin-san...

00:02:59.846 --> 00:03:01.548
is amazing!

00:03:01.548 --> 00:03:04.584
It’s such a tough world!

00:03:05.285 --> 00:03:07.220
Registers at the convenience store...

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.322
are just too hard to deal with!

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.325
My pay rate...

00:03:12.325 --> 00:03:14.127
just won’t ever rise!!

00:03:17.897 --> 00:03:19.299
Neeeeigh!

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:20.833
I’m a unicorn!

00:03:20.833 --> 00:03:22.368
I’m not a

00:03:22.368 --> 00:03:23.536
cool unicorn

00:03:23.536 --> 00:03:26.005
like you’re all thinking...

00:03:26.005 --> 00:03:28.041
If anything

00:03:28.041 --> 00:03:29.642
I’m a very horse-like unicorn!

00:03:29.642 --> 00:03:30.977
Neigh~!

00:03:30.977 --> 00:03:31.880
Take a look at this-

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:33.279
Ahh~

00:03:34.314 --> 00:03:35.315
...ahh~

00:03:35.315 --> 00:03:36.883
It’s super easy

00:03:36.883 --> 00:03:38.084
for dentists

00:03:38.084 --> 00:03:38.918
to take a look

00:03:38.918 --> 00:03:40.286
at my teeth, isn’t that cool?

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:41.487
I have great teeth

00:03:41.487 --> 00:03:42.322
Only pure maidens

00:03:42.322 --> 00:03:43.122
can ride

00:03:43.122 --> 00:03:46.226
atop my back,  but...

00:03:46.226 --> 00:03:47.760
I think

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.000
I’d let you ride me too!

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.797
Hey?

00:03:50.797 --> 00:03:57.303
Heeeeeeeeeeeeeeey there!

00:03:57.937 --> 00:03:59.205
Ah, I popped out!

00:03:59.205 --> 00:04:00.406
This is so fun!

00:04:00.406 --> 00:04:01.241
Apple!

00:04:01.241 --> 00:04:03.176
I have a little request

00:04:03.176 --> 00:04:06.250
Please release an ‘Animoji’ of me~!
