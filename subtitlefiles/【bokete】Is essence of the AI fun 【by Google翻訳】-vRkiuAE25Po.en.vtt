Hello everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai here!

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:04.020
What does this mean!!?

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.260
Having said that, I already did "Bokete #2" before, but...

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.140
This time, I’ll be doing "Bokete #3"

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.580
Man, I’ve already done a lot...

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:14.720
So then make sure to do "Bokete" with me, yes?

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.300
In this case, let's start at once!

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:17.060
Bokete!

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:18.720
Hello everyone!
*Remembering that character, perform a verse of 5, 7 and 5 syllables*

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:19.340
*Remembering that character, perform a verse of 5, 7 and 5 syllables*

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:21.360
I’m Kizuna Ai, the self proclaimed genius
*Remembering that character, perform a verse of 5, 7 and 5 syllables*

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.080
Eh? I called myself "self proclaimed"

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.840
Bokete!

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.720
"The mystery of the three worlds"

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:27.760
"The world of the afterlife"

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:28.880
"Inside Mickey..."

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:30.420
"My existence"

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:31.360
Bokete!

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.160
Smiling is so tiring, right?

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:35.940
Bokete!

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:37.740
Even when I act like I'm crying...

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.080
...I don't get the "Ok" from the director

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:41.080
Bokete!

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.300
While I hid to scare someone...

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.700
They started talking bad about me...

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.660
And I completely lost the chance to come out

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:49.300
Bokete!

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.260
Coming to the zoo with a man that I don’t know very well...

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:54.840
Is rather uncomfortable...

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:55.940
Bokete!

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:58.720
I’m a first year student...

00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:59.620
Is there a problem??

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:00.460
Bokete!

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:01.980
Aaahhh...

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.840
Now that this photo was made public, I’m finished...

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:05.780
Aaahh...

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:06.760
Waah!

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.060
Without even realizing, I wounded up regretting in this place!

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:10.140
Bokete!

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.020
I’ll resist!

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:13.180
With my fists!!

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:14.940
Today, I also did "Bokete"!

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.640
What do you think of my high-sense jokes?

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.720
If I think of new ones, I’ll do it once again!

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.240
This was Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai!

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:23.500
See you later!

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:24.420
Bokete!
*Do a "Bokete" of this face!*

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:25.040
*Do a "Bokete" of this face!*

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.040
