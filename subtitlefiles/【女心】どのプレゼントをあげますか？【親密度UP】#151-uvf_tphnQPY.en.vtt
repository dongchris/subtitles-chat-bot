00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:03.080
Hello everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai here!

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:04.300
I know it's sudden, but...!

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:06.500
Now I'll do a knowledge test about a woman's heart!

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:08.780
Do you have a woman that you like?

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:09.700
Eh? What about me?

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:10.980
Come on, come on...

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:11.480
Eh?

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.620
Are you doing your best to get your attention?

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:15.620
Ah, that's not good

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:20.620
In that case, choose a gift from the following options to give me...

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.920
To increase your relationship with me, yes?

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:24.220
Ahh!

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:25.720
So you've come!

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:27.820
What's going on?

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:32.340
Flowers?

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.860
It's not very original but I'm very happy!

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:37.800
*Cake*

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:39.320
Oooh!

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:40.680
Sweets!

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:42.600
Is it like the saying "A sweet is better than flowers"?
(Basically better something useful than something nice)

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:44.840
You make me so happy!

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:45.560
Good...

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.620
Even though I can't eat...

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.760
Eh?

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:53.280
Money?

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.500
You're quite direct, aren't you?

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.640
Is this really real money?

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.140
It's not fake bills?

00:00:59.440 --> 00:00:59.940
Eh?

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:01.820
A billion yen?

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:02.880
Eh?

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:04.060
Really?

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:05.720
Yaaaay!

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:07.880
I'm very happy!

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.020
Since I have a billion yen...

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.280
I can take a bath of bills!

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:13.960
Do you want to take a bath with me?

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.140
Good, in this case...

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.720
Now that you have understood a woman's heart...

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.740
We'll talk to the heroine of Soul Reverse Zero, Luce-chan

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.140
To increase our relationship with her!

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.080
From the main menu, we choose the option "Luce's house"

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:30.960
Gifts!

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:32.600
And then...

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:34.840
Let's choose Luce, right?
*You've come to see me?*

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:36.520
Eh? What should I do?

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.460
Is this tea? Tea and...

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:39.820
What's this? A shower?

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.660
A shower?

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.920
Mmm...

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.140
Well...

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.340
In this case, I'll choose tea!

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:45.380
Is this black tea?

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:46.360
Eh?

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.620
Is this a dish with boiled egg?

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.020
It doesn't look well done, right?

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:53.760
A dish with boiled egg...

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.860
I'll choose this!

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.880
Yes!

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:57.560
Aaaah!
*Luce: Thank you very much!*

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.620
If you increase your relationship with her...

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.900
You can read her history!

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.980
Don't you think it's great?

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:04.080
Yes!

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.240
Like I announced last time...

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:08.980
I'll do the collaboration mission with Berserk!

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:10.300
Having said that...

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:11.700
Definitely, you know...

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:15.300
If I don't have some character from the collaboration, I won't get excited, so then...!

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:16.800
You could say that I could not start without having one...

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:18.120
It's because of that, that...!

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.320
I'll do summonings! Summonings!

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.720
Durante el evento de colaboracióning the collaboration event...

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:25.120
There exists a special summoning called "Step-up"

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.960
Which is focused on the spiritual hero...

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.900
Guts!

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.620
The characters I use are all supportive...

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.915
But Guts is not only a supporting character...

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:36.860
But also can perform physical attacks, right?

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:38.800
So then I plan to work hard...

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.040
To obtain it!

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.940
Also...

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:44.380
Then I'll explain how you can get many rewards in the event missions

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:45.680
Well...

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.940
By using Berserk characters...

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.940
There are many ways to get rewards

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.480
Having said that, I'll try hard!

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:54.380
Guts!

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:56.280
I plan to obtain it!

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.100
I'll do my best with Guts!

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.980
Only with Guts...

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.220
Ah, I'm mistaken, I said whatever...

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:01.260
In this case...

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.080
There exists a summoning called "Step-up"

00:03:04.085 --> 00:03:05.240
Which can be done eight times....

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:09.740
And when you reach the eighth summoning, you'll get a 100% probability ...
(A character of SSR rarity)

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:11.300
I'll summon until I can obtain it!

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:13.820
Good! Comenzaré con la primera invocación.

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.440
Well, if it's about me, I can probably...

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.080
Get a rare character in my fourth summoning...

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.780
Surely, right?

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.120
Here I go!

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.960
Mmm?

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:24.300
Mmm?

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.260
Plus, you might get an common girl, right?

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:28.880
Owch...

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:31.500
Ah, if I at least obtain a girl...

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:32.160
Ah! Oh! Oh!

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.960
Oh!

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:34.240
Oh?

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.980
Not really...

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:40.020
Ah! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:41.080
AH!

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:42.080
How adorable!

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:43.500
She's the best...

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:45.640
Man, how adorable

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:47.360
What is she?

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.780
She seems to be a maid of high society.
*She's a figure of Chinese history*

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:53.600
Man, in the next summoning, I'll get a SSR rank character, right?

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:55.060
Soiyaa!

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:57.700
Come!

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:01.660
Come! Come! Come!

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:03.340
Ahh...

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:07.940
And now... Ah! Ah! Ah! And now...!

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:11.160
Ah, Cassandra-chan!

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:13.200
Ah, she surpassed her limit!

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:18.140
Oh? Oh?

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:21.240
Come to me! Ahh...

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:22.240
A girl or Guts!

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:23.640
A girl...!

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.520
Oh! Oh! Oh! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:26.520
Ah! Ah!

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:29.480
Oh?

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:30.460
Eh? Eh?

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:32.640
Oh! Oh! Oh!

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:34.000
Ooohh?

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:35.860
Eh? Ah! Ah!

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:38.840
Farnese-chan!

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:42.640
She's also part of the collaboration with Berserk!

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:44.060
Man! Incredible!

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:47.060
Ah! This? This? This?

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:48.980
Eh?

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:50.220
Ah, but she's adorable

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:53.600
Oh! Oh! Oh! Come!

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:55.460
Ah! Ah! It appeared! It appeared!

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:56.300
Guts?

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:57.940
It's not him, but...

00:04:58.780 --> 00:04:59.560
A guy?

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:02.800
Eh?

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:05.180
Eh?

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:06.400
And now... Eh?

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:08.360
And no... and now!

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:09.700
And now...

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:10.960
And now...!

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:12.660
It's over!

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:15.420
He has the appearance of a beautiful girl but it's a young boy!

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:16.980
Don't deceive me!

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:17.480
No!

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:20.860
I got some rare characters so it was not bad, right?

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:22.640
Farnese-chan!

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:24.800
She's adorable, she's great

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:26.820
Her short hair is great, right?

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:27.540
How adorable!

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:31.220
She also has a profile with her biography, right?

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:35.260
Incredible! She moves so fluently

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:36.800
It's great, right?

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:38.580
Even when it comes to a 3D model...

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:41.900
The character does not deform, it's great...

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:44.480
Next time! Definitely!

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:45.860
Here I go!

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:48.380
Guts or a girl! Guts or a girl!

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:49.860
Ah, ah, is it useless?

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:52.500
Ah! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! And now, just a bit more!

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:54.420
Ah, it's useless... ah, but she's adorable

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:57.480
They all have amazing breasts

00:05:59.040 --> 00:05:59.780
Come on, please...

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:01.160
Go for it! Go for it!

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:03.180
Ah!

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:07.340
AND NOW!

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:10.060
Mmm...

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:13.560
Mmm...

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:15.540
Mmm...

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:19.620
How adorable

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:21.540
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:22.960
And now? Just a bit more! Aaaah! Go for it!

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:25.120
Aaaahh... it's a guy?

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:26.040
I see

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:27.580
Oh! Oh! Oh!

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:29.400
At least be a girl!

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:33.180
If you look at it closely, it looks like a girl, right?

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:35.780
Guts! Guts!

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:39.660
She's an adorable girl...

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:40.260
Oh! Oh!

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:41.980
Just a bit more! Just a bit more! Just a bit more!

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:42.740
Just a bit more, of rainbow color!

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:44.440
Aaaahhhh!

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:52.740
Oh!

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:54.820
And now...! I want it to shine more, but...!

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:57.600
It was useless! A girl with glasses looks good, good, good...

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:00.000
Come! Come! Go for it!

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.200
A bit more! A bit more! A bit more! Rainbow color!

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:03.920
Ah, it looks like it's useless

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:06.640
It's not that I have particularly bad luck summoning, so...

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:10.300
Why doesn't any character that I like appears?

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:13.000
Oh!

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.220
A little more, a little more, go up... rainbow color...

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:16.020
Ah, it's useless...

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:16.520
Aaaah!

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:18.360
Very good, it appeared, right?

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:21.240
Here, you have a guaranteed SSR rank character, so...

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:22.940
I want to get Guts...

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:24.220
Come Guts! Come Guts!

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:25.720
*strange A.I noises*

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:26.560
Good

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:27.380
Here I go!

00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:29.840
Come, Guts!

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:35.540
Guts!

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:38.240
I'll be motivated! I'll be motivated!

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:39.100
Guts!

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:39.760
Come!

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:44.060
Aaaah!

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:48.100
I wonder why...

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:51.240
To top it off, judging by his weapon, it seems to be a character that attacks from the back

00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:54.020
Yes, it is a character that attacks from the rear...

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:55.920
Thank you so much for everything!

00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:56.420
Well...

00:07:56.660 --> 00:07:58.340
Normally it make me happy, but...

00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:00.780
Today I wanted to get Guts, so then...

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:03.040
Well, well, well!

00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:04.580
She's adorable, so it's good!

00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:06.740
Good! Having said that...

00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:07.520
Well...

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:09.500
It wasn't a failure, but..

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:10.880
I got a character different from the one I wanted

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:12.600
And the summoning turned out in reverse, right?

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:14.260
Man, it turned out in reverse, right?

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:16.020
Well, I'm going to sort it out now

00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:18.740
To defeat this enemy character...

00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:21.440
You must accomplish event missions to gather cannonballs...

00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:23.020
I already added Farnese-chan to my team!

00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:25.860
So then, I'll start right away!

00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:29.760
*You must not fall in love with my beauty*

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:34.300
These "Soul Arts"...

00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:36.080
Can only be used once...

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:37.780
You can only use them once per character so...

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:39.140
Use them...

00:08:39.660 --> 00:08:40.760
That's the key, right?

00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:43.800
I think with the team I have, I can...

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:47.840
Complete with great difficulty, the "Advanced" mission...

00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:48.940
So I'll try hard!

00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:51.520
The Soul Arts...

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:54.680
I should keep them and use them at the right moment...

00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:57.640
I'll only use Cassandra-chan's...

00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:02.560
I'll use a Soul Art in advance

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:04.420
Fairies! Good! Good!

00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:12.060
And later, well...

00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:13.720
Until I get to the boss...

00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:16.540
I'd like to continue without using any more...

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:19.660
Soi!

00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:21.840
Oh!

00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:23.620
Doesn't it seem like I'm doing well?

00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:26.780
It looks dangerous...

00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:31.520
And now...

00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:32.940
Within all the characters...

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:35.080
Zenobia-chan is...

00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:36.700
Well...

00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:38.860
It's possible to be defeated in the first area, so...

00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:40.820
I'll use the Soul Art first...

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:45.980
And here...

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:49.920
If you don't cause the damage that it indicates...

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:52.140
You'll receive an incredible attack

00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:53.020
So I want to do my best!

00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:54.200
Let's go, go for it!

00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:57.000
Ah, I'm in trouble now!

00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:00.880
I'm about to die...

00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:01.960
I'm about to die...

00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:03.060
I'm about to die...

00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:03.560
Do you see?

00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:04.380
No!

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:05.900
Go fo...!

00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:08.580
Waiiit!

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:17.100
I want him to remain paralyzed

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:21.500
But the making of this Soul Art is...

00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:22.660
Surprising!

00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:25.160
It's beautiful and I never really tire of seeing it!

00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:29.400
Just by pressing the buttons...

00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:31.980
I feel like I'm doing something amazing...

00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:34.680
He's suffering a hallucination, right?

00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:35.180
Oh!

00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:35.900
Very good!

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:38.540
That was my objective!

00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:42.500
Good, good

00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:47.120
Ah, maybe?

00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:49.180
It'll be easier than I thought?

00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:52.620
Oh?

00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:56.000
Maybe I can do it?

00:10:58.700 --> 00:10:59.200
Ah!

00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:03.740
Man, my team has gotten very powerful, right?

00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:05.400
Is it good?

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:07.420
Very good!

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:09.120
Just a bit more!

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:12.340
Just a bit more! Just a bit more!

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:13.800
Good!

00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:15.740
I WOOON!

00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:18.700
It's to be expected...!

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:21.000
Of my adorable girls, right?

00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:22.180
And now...

00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:24.300
I got some cannonballs...

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:26.980
When choosing the option "Load Cannon Ball"

00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:29.240
I prepared half of the cannon balls, so then...

00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:32.460
I'll choose the "Maximum" option

00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:33.820
Hey!

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:38.760
Chaaan!

00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:39.840
I defeated it, right?

00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:40.900
It turns out, that...

00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:43.580
You can obtain a lot of different items

00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:46.460
I got event tickets...

00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:50.780
And well, this...

00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:52.640
Occasionally appears...

00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:53.520
An apostle...

00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:56.980
Called "Grunbeld", but...

00:11:57.740 --> 00:11:59.040
If you manage to defeat him...

00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:00.620
It turns out, that...

00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:04.320
You can get many spiritual heroes!

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:05.400
Ah, I'm mistaken

00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:09.400
Take this!

00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:17.720
*The apostle is approaching*

00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:18.220
Oh!

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:20.560
"The apostle approached"

00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:24.640
And now...!

00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:26.220
Enough of minor enemies!

00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:27.920
Already just by looking at it, you realize that it's a minor enemy!

00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:31.540
Hey!

00:12:31.940 --> 00:12:33.720
Why are only goblins appearing? Goblins?

00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:38.800
And now...!

00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:40.560
Oh! Oh!

00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:42.040
Grunbeld!

00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:43.120
He appeared!

00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:46.860
I'll use lots of bullets...

00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:48.080
Oh!

00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:49.160
I wonder if I can do it

00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:50.480
Soiyaa!

00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:51.920
Ah, not yet...

00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:54.020
Mmm?

00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:57.860
Is it turning out that I'm not doing anything to him?

00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:02.040
Eh?

00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:04.360
He seems to have fled...

00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:08.080
Man, I struggled to accumulate a lot, but...

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:10.740
He seems to have escaped...

00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:14.640
Be sure to gather lots of cannonballs so you can defeat it, okay?

00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:18.180
What did you think of my failure in summonings?

00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:21.920
And also, with the collaboration with Berserk, I'm very excited...

00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:24.040
So make sure you play too! Yes?

00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:29.060
The collaboration with Berserk is from July 24th to August 7th!

00:13:29.060 --> 00:13:30.220
I'm counting on you guys!

00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:32.440
Take revenge for me

00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:34.260
Obtain Guts, please

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:36.120
Well, if you do get it, I will be somewhat sad...

00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:37.640
If someone succeeds...

00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:39.940
They can boast about it on Twitter

00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:40.640
Although I'll cry

00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:43.120
This was Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai!

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:44.040
See you later!
