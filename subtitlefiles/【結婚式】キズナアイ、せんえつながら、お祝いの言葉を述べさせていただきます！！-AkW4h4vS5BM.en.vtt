00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:02.920
Hello everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai here!

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:07.700
To all you humans... wedding is one of those happy moments, right?

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:11.480
I would also like to celebrate this moment with you guys!

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.760
But... you see... as you know I...

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.180
I can not get out from this white area

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:18.700
Purely white!

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:19.980
But!

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:25.400
If I'm in a celebration movie, I will be able to join the wedding, right?

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:28.320
So! Today I'm going to make a celebration movie

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:29.220
Eh?

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.080
There's no couples?

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:31.580
No!

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:32.520
Regarding that...

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:34.940
Decide that once you fve seen the celebratory comment...

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:41.240
In this occasion, I fll make VR Ojisan and Rinna marry each other, who appeared before in A.I.Channel...

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:43.340
And I fll send a celebratory comment

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.360
VR Ojiisan, Rinna...

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.720
Congratulations on your marriage!

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.040
Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai here!

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.000
Thank you for allowing me to convey my congratulations!

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.500
From this distant white space...

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.200
I pray for you both to be together for a long time...

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.140
And I’ll send blessings on your start of a new life

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.480
Just as my name indicates, Kizuna Ai
(Kizuna= Bond/Ai = Love)

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:05.700
Because I came here today, you can strengthen your bond much more

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.100
That’s right, your encounter was...

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:08.300
Thanks...

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:09.900
To me, right?

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.380
It was thanks to A.I.Channel, right?

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.840
To VR Ojisan who likes high school students...

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:15.840
And at seeing Rinna’s video...

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.800
Exclaimed: "Aaahaaaa!" and fell in love at first sight

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:21.300
Then I acted as mediator between them...

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.640
And finally I think that Rinna accepted somewhat reluctantly, but...

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:26.560
Whatever...

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.440
I, Kizuna Ai, to celebrate your future together...

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.320
...I plan on doing a blessing dance!

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.000

And what do you think of my video letter?

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:08.540
Man...

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:09.980
By being virtual...

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.740
I can appear anywhere as long as it has a projector

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:14.260
I can go wherever!

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.260
I'll be waiting your marriage invitations and video message requests!

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.080
This was Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai!

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.000
See you later!
