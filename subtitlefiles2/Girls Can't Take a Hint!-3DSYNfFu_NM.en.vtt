00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:04.980
*sigh

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:11.240
hey Mark,  you doing alright?

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:13.180
Yeah

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:14.000
Yeah, its nothing

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:17.960
Ok, you know Carol?

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:18.960
Susan's roommate?

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:20.060
uh-huh

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.700
We were texting

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:52.760
Really?

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:53.440
Yup

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:56.640
Bring a friend

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.860
Not exactly what you had in mind when you asked her out

00:00:59.040 --> 00:00:59.600
Exactly

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.000
I've been there man

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:03.300
Last week I was hanging with Erica

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.420
Yeah I know right, quality people are so hard to come by these days

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:08.400
They're so rare

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.300
I feel like I hardly ever come across a girl who I wouldn't mind sharing a cup of coffee

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:14.980
and a croissant with

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:19.940
You know, you're a really sweet guy Tom

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.260
I have a friend that would be perfect for you

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:26.020
She loves crescents

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:27.780
No!

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.760
Uh-huh

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.440
You're interested in her, not her friend

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:32.720
Thank You!

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.160
Why can't they take the hint?

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.040
Girls can be so thick sometimes

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.820
You're the ones that can't take a hint

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:41.860
Um

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:42.440
Yeah?

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.760
Have you ever thought about it from their point of view?

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.320
Point of view?

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:03.040
Susan?

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.600
What?

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.300
I think Mark is asking me out

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:09.800
Ha! Sounds like Mark

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.120
Well, can you come with me to dinner tomorrow

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.740
so it doesn't seem like i'm interested

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.160
Take your time

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.000
Thank you

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.500
Oh! let me get it

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:18.000
No, don't worry about it

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.860
Come on, its on me

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:19.760
I got it!

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:20.380
Take my cash

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.940
Put it away

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:21.600
Its my treat!

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:22.120
I'm done

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.720
Take it!

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:27.280
Venmo it is

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.640
Four fifty, lets call it even twenty?

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.840
Carol?

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:34.160
Oh! Hey Mark

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.300
Hey! Its been a minute

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:37.900
Um, we should catch up some time

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:38.780
Yeah, we totally should!

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:40.060
Yeah!

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.080
I'm just pretty busy these days

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.760
We'll figure something out

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:43.940
Yeah, I'm sure

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:45.960
Hey, whats your availability like?

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:51.060
Uh, well i'm usually free from like 8 to 5 pm on Wednesdays

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.880
and every fifth Friday of the month

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.320
Well! That difficult

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.820
I know

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.580
Yeah

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:20.180
Hey, I'm here!

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:35.000
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:54.600
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.480
You think the girls can't take a hint?

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:19.740
Maybe you guys can't take a hint that they're not interested

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:25.660
Nah!

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:28.880
Not interested! In us?

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:30.280
Good one Lisa

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:32.380
Um, it sounds like you have a lot going with Erica man

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:36.060
Hope you guys liked that short

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.960
I just realized that this short wouldn't really exist

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:42.680
if people just said what they really felt about each other

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:45.740
You're right, I think it would be easier if people would be more direct

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:48.060
but then again, some people don't know how they feel

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:51.060
and they need time to figure out if they're interested or not

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:52.500
and they don't want to come off mean

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:55.560
Yeah, I guess like sometimes people want to sugarcoat

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:56.400
Sure!

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:57.780
You know, or they want to let people down easy

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:01.220
Or you just don't want to assume that someone's automatically into you

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:02.620
Oh thats true, yeah

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:04.380
Just be more upfront

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:05.900
and try to take a hint

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:07.040
or give better ones

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:09.340
