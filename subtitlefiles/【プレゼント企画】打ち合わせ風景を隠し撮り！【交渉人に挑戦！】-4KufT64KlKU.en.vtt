00:00:00.285 --> 00:00:03.305
Hello everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai here!

00:00:03.305 --> 00:00:06.265
Would you believe it, today, the producer of a game called Valkyrie connect

00:00:06.265 --> 00:00:08.865
Is apparently coming for a meeting

00:00:09.455 --> 00:00:10.455
So...

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:11.780
Originally...

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:15.855
I was supposed to record a video in accordance with the suggestions made here, but...

00:00:15.855 --> 00:00:19.235
This time, I will change things up and execute the next secret plan

00:00:20.185 --> 00:00:22.605
“I’ll give a present from the game’s producer to all our viewers!”

00:00:22.915 --> 00:00:24.375
“The negotiator Kizuna Ai”

00:00:24.375 --> 00:00:25.685
With that being said...

00:00:25.685 --> 00:00:28.675
I’ll use my intelligence to the fullest...

00:00:28.675 --> 00:00:31.745
So I will win that present for the sake of all of you watching

00:00:31.745 --> 00:00:33.545
Please enjoy right until the end

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.700
*Today’s topic:
I invited the producer to a meeting and I’ll record a video. He doesn’t know about it
Objective:
With my negotiation power to its maximum power, I’ll win a reward for you!*

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.400
Yes, excuse me

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.600
O: Oh! I’m virtual now, aren't I? 
A: That’s right!

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.240
A: Now, ‘how’ you entered is an NDA (non disclosure agreement) okay?
O: Okay!

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.740
O: Oh! Is the camera still running?

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:53.700
A: No, it’s not running at all, it’s alright, please relax

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.760
O: I understand, is that so, hmmm?

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.000
O: So, for now, is it okay if we start with a small meeting?

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.180
A: Yes! Let’s do this!
Ozekin: Have you played Valkyrie connect?

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.420
A: Ah! Y’know, the truth is...

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.240
A: I’ve seen it, but I haven’t played it

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.240
A: I wanted to have this meeting with a blank state

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.940
A: And this area is like a blank slate too (badly translated pun)
O: Ah! I see, I understand

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.080
O: Well, umm, this is a promotion video, so

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.680
O: I would like to explain as we watch it

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:21.880
A: Oh! Thank you very much!
O: Yes, Yes

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.940
O: Alright, with that the promotional video begins

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.680
O: It starts with a tragic scene

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:33.500
A: Woah!

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:34.080
O: Yes

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.060
O: And this monster...

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.000
O: Eeehh... Well, it destroys the city

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:38.720
A: Eeeh?

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:39.920
O: That's right

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:41.000
A: I'll finish it off

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.220
O: And then, yes, I'd like to see that, but...

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.580
O: ... That's when the protagonist appears
A: Breasts!

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.000
O: That's right, and the monster beats her

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.640
O: And, like that, that's how the story begins, but...

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.240
O: ... It's a 3D game with a lot of animations

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.500
A: Wow! Looks fun, there's so many characters on screen!

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.140
O: Yeah that's the case, thank you

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:02.780
A: So lively!

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.400
O: And from here is the character introductions… and this is what it's like-

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:07.300
A: Oh, this girl!

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:08.760
A: She's the.. uh.. one on the icon

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:10.500
O: Oh yeah, yep, that's right

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.500
O: ...So a lot of the characters are from Norse mythology

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.280
O: But they move around in 3D

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.820
O: So I think the game's pretty fun even just looking at them

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:20.720
A: You're right! They're really cute when they become small

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:21.560
O: Thank you

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:22.340
A: Oh, I like this one!

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.020
O: Oh really, thank you

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.880
O: Yes

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.440
O: So, the first monster is...

00:02:27.445 --> 00:02:30.325
O: Well, messing up the city

00:02:30.325 --> 00:02:33.300
O: So Skuld, the protagonist

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.000
O: Has come to save the day, and the game starts from here
A: I see

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.740
O: That's the kind of game this is

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.220
A: From what I can see from this preview

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.720
O: Yeah

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:43.900
A: The twintail girl used in the icon is...

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:44.540
A: An antagonist?

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:45.520
O: Yep, that's right

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:46.400
O: She's a baddie

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.080
O: That girl is known as the the Queen of Helheim

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.535
O: So she's.. . y'know, a queen

00:02:51.535 --> 00:02:54.385
O: But she's the queen of a place called "Helheim"

00:02:54.385 --> 00:02:56.575
O: Which is a place where the dead gather

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.940
O: So she kind of a like a death god, like queen of death gods

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.120
A: Ah, I see

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.880
O: So she's a baddie- baddie?

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:04.960
O: Well, from her perspective

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:08.900
O: She is what she is so she doesn't see herself as the baddie

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.040
O: But for the general population, she is a baddie

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:13.460
A: I see, what a sad story

00:03:13.625 --> 00:03:15.175
A: In that case, I'll join the bad side

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:19.660
O: The preview itself was a little to fast so

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:20.480
A: True

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.800
O: So I've brought a PowerPoint with me today

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.800
O: So if I could get you to view that

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:25.380
A: Sure

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.880
O: Alright, so, Valkyrie Connect introduction

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.915
O: So the setting, as previously mentioned...

00:03:30.915 --> 00:03:33.505
O: Is a setting based around Norse mythology

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:36.540
O: So the characters that appear

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.520
O: I think there would be some with names you'd know

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.400
A: Ah, yeah, true, like Loki and Freya and...

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:42.940
O: Yeah, that's right

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:45.640
O: They're used quite frequently in other games, so...

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:46.260
A: Yeah, true

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:50.100
O: And Thor has his own movie made... etc

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:52.740
A: Movie? What movie

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:56.060
O: The uh, Hollywood movie, "Thor"

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:57.000
A: "Thor"...

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.600
O: The uh, one with the hammer

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.120
A: Generation gap, I guess!

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.940
O: Alright! Let's go next!

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.480
O: The story sets out like this
(Author goes over text)

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:08.720
O: It’s got gods and giants and divine beasts and humans

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:14.640
O: This variety of races were living under the protection of Yggdrasil

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:18.100
O: And then the world's balance starts to crumble

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:21.920
O: And the protagonist, from the preview

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:24.115
O: Is the, uh, viewer watching

00:04:24.115 --> 00:04:27.065
O: And is called by the valkyrie

00:04:27.065 --> 00:04:30.125
O: - Skult, the one we saw before -

00:04:30.125 --> 00:04:32.960
O: And gets involved in a journey to save the world. That's the gist of the story

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:33.740
A: I see

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:36.160
A: Alright! Can I say something?

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:40.520
A: Why, even though there's gods, giants, divine beasts and humans

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:42.140
A: Is there no A.I?

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:44.940
O: I don't think A.I’s existed in this era...

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:46.380
A: I see

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:47.240
A: Then

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.000
A: You can add that in later

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.680
O: Yep, Alright- the "A.I race"

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:51.780
A: Wait, you just said "alright"

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:52.520
O: Ah, I actually didn't

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:54.880
O: Wait, for now, for now...

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:55.520
A: For now

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:58.140
O: For now, we'll, uh, consider it

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:01.500
A: I see, I see, for now, I see
O: Yes, yes, that's right, yes

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:04.595
A: But yeah, it's pretty nice, rather divine
O: Yes

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:07.560
A: With gods and giants ...and divine beasts
O: Yes,yes

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:10.820
O: Divine beasts... those are the big monster-like things we saw earlier

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:11.420
A: Ah, in the PV

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:13.640
O: Yeah, that one is Fenrir

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:16.740
O: Which is the most powerful divine beast in Norse mythology

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:18.480
O: And lots of these types appear

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:19.980
O: So you can battle with them

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:21.420
A: I see

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:23.600
A: Mmm! Thank you

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:26.320
O: So the characters, we can scroll through these...

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:28.860
O: Actually never mind, we can skip them

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:33.320
O: Alright, so this game's selling point

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:37.500
O: Is that it's an easy-to-control full-scale RPG battle

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:38.720
A: Sounds good

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:40.440
O: And, all you have to do is press buttons

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:42.160
O: After that, you just have to watch

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:42.980
A: Even I can do it

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:46.200
O: Yeah, that's right, anyone can do it

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:48.840
O: During the game, there's two ultimate abilities

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:51.260
O: Called Action Skill and Limit Burst

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:54.300
O: And it's a game where you press these buttons

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:55.780
O: So anyone can easily play

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:57.400
A: So it's mostly timing?

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:58.680
O: That's right, that's right, mostly timing

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:00.220
A: It seems like it would spread quite easily

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:01.270
O: That's right

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:03.580
O: Even a beginner can do it easily
A: That's true

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:06.290
A: After all, games are meant to be enjoyed right?
O: Yes, yes

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:09.310
O: You can also make complex character builds with the character whatever-this-is-called system

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:09.930
A: Ahh
O: Yes

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:12.710
O: Any character can be raised to a 5-star rarity

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:14.020
O: where 5-star is the highest rarity

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:14.570
A: Ahh

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:15.900
O: Since any character can become a 5-star

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:17.610
O: there are no throw-away characters

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:20.910
A: I see
O: It's one of Valkyrie Connect's special features

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:22.060
A: Amazing
O: Yes

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:24.090
O: You will be able to equip lots of items...

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:27.200
O: And recruit members

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:29.200
O: And customise them all you want, and we thought this would be cool!

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:32.050
A: I see, that means I can make my waifu doesn't it
O: Your wa... Yes, that's right

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:33.000
O: You can make...

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:33.630
A: I can make

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:35.740
O: ...That character
A: Ahhhh

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:38.640
O: One more feature is the ability to co-op with your friends across the country

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:39.490
O: They're called "Connect Battles"

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:40.370
A: Connect Battles?

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:41.450
O: Yes, that's correct

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:45.790
O: In them, up to three players can challenge a large boss

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:49.090
O: Each player can control 5 characters, so you can have 15 characters at once

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:49.790
A: Ahhhhh

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:52.740
O: Fighting a boss with 15 characters

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:55.240
O: makes for a pretty intense mode
A: I see

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:57.350
O: So definitely try playing it for a bit
A: Yes!

00:06:57.350 --> 00:07:00.050
O: Ah! Yes like this
A: Oh! this liveliness feels good

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:01.710
O: Oh, it’s like they’re making lots of noises

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:04.100
O: You will be able to play whilst being connected to a lot of people
A: Ahhh

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:06.260
O: Yes, I think it's very interesting
A: I see

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:06.770
O: OK

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:08.280
A.I.Channel!

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:10.790
O: Ok this time

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:13.910
O:  I would like to collaborate with Ai-san

00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:15.520
A: I see!

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:16.410
A: All right

00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:17.750
A: This is just between you and me

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:21.890
A: I actually feel like I have a really strong affinity with this game

00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:23.510
O: Oh, is that true?
A: Yes

00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:26.020
A: How do you say it, that thing you talked about earlier

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:27.590
A: The one called "Connect"

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:28.940
A: Is really great don't you think?

00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:32.480
A: I also want to connect with everyone

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:34.130
A: Which is what I'm doing with this channel

00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:36.260
A: That's a huge thing we have in common, isn't it

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.080
O: I see...

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:39.180
O: That sounds... passionate

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:40.900
A: I really am
O: Eh?  Hahaha

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:43.150
O: You really are

00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:44.000
A: but

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:49.120
A: You want to connect with your users more, don’t you?

00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:50.420
O: That's definitely true

00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:51.460
A: Definitely

00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:54.540
A: With such great cute girls available

00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:56.640
A: And being easy to play for anyone

00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:58.060
A: They’ll also be able to train them

00:07:58.060 --> 00:07:59.540
A: Speaking of connecting...

00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:01.270
A: What about social networking services?

00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:06.680
A: For example, I could spread information across all of my followers in my Twitter account

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:09.300
O: Oh, can you do that? I'd be really glad if you do that

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:10.720
A: But, you know...

00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:14.300
A: No, of course that I can spread it, but...
*This is where the manipulation starts!!*

00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:18.900
A: ... I think that, if I tweet it without receiving something in exchange, it won't have that much effect

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:21.240
A: Well, I really feel like it won't have effect

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:24.140
A: I wonder if there's a better way

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:25.140
O: Hmm... That's right

00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:28.340
O: I wonder if there's a way to make it more known
*Planning / Starting negotiation*

00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:29.980
A: That's right, hmm...
*Planning / Starting negotiation*

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:32.280
A: What can we do?

00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:38.480
A: Isn't there a way where both of us can win? A way where we and the viewers can win?

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:41.200
O: Hmm... That's right, well...

00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:46.400
O: So, Something like a present, maybe...?

00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:48.880
A: Ah! Aaahhh, now I see!

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.920
A: A present for our viewers?

00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:55.020
O: Hypothetically speaking...

00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:56.860
O: Could it be something like a present campaign?

00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:57.420
A: Aaah!

00:08:57.700 --> 00:09:00.160
A: I see, so...

00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:01.500
A: ... They'll gift something, right?

00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:04.340
A: Woah, I didn't think about that!

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:05.780
O: Well, that was hypothetical, right?

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:08.400
A: Oh, man. It was just as expected. Just as expected of you, Ozekin-san

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:10.380
A: You have a nice standpoint

00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:12.040
A: Definitely, the producer...

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:17.140
A: ... Has to start seeing it frame by frame, right?

00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:18.420
A: That's amazing!

00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:20.060
O: It was just an hypothesis!

00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:22.440
A: Eh? By the way, hypothetically speaking...

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.540
A: What can kind of things can you give?

00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:27.420
O: Eh?
A: Eh?

00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:29.900
A: No, well, basically, considering the budget

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:32.240
A: What kind of things can you give?

00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:37.300
O: No, well, I think that's not something I can decide

00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:39.700
A: Eh? But, isn't the producer the highest position?
*Pressing to get an answer*

00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:44.320
O: No, but there are other positions, like, for example "Executive Producer"
A: Aaah, I see

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:44.880
O: Yes

00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:47.180
A: In that case, putting jokes aside
O: Yes

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:49.020
A: Supposing, and just supposing...
O: Yes

00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:49.880
A: What kind of things can you give?

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:51.480
O: Hmm... Well, I suppose that...

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:55.680
O: We could give diamonds
A: Aaah!

00:09:55.820 --> 00:09:57.020
A: Will you give diamonds?

00:09:57.020 --> 00:09:57.840
O: It's just a supposition

00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:01.460
A: Assuming that you'll give diamonds...
*Diamonds in Valkyrie Connect are used to make summonings and recover stamina*

00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:02.700
A: Will you be able to give 100 million?
*Diamonds in Valkyrie Connect are used to make summonings and recover stamina*

00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:03.780
O: Ah?
A: Ah?

00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:06.280
O: 100 million well, probably...

00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:07.820
O: ... I think that's not possible

00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:09.840
O: I don't even need to ask another person to know that

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:11.260
A: Hmm... I see

00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:13.060
A: In that case...

00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:14.640
A: 10 million diamonds!

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:17.840
O: 10 million diamonds, well...
*Can I do it if I press a little more?*

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:19.940
O: That’s still more than we usually give, but...

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:21.380
O: I see

00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:27.740
O: Hmm... I definitely think that that won't be possible, can you reduce a bit the amount of diamonds?

00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:29.980
A: No, but that's when you, as a producer...

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.540
O: Well, I'd like to confirm it with my superiors

00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:35.440
A: Hmm... I see

00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:43.720
A: Oh, man. Today I was able to feel how amazing this game is and the passion that you feel for it, Ozekin-san

00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:46.300
A: I'd like that more people would play this game

00:10:46.300 --> 00:10:49.480
A: And I also want to make happy the ones that are watching us

00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:51.700
A: I'm being serious

00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:54.960
A: I want to make everyone smile and I want to connect with them!

00:10:55.660 --> 00:10:58.660
A: That's why, in order to make it happen...

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:04.460
A: Right? Well, I think that giving everyone diamonds is a great idea

00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:06.080
A: So please do it~

00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:08.540
O: Hmm... Well, you're making it hard for me

00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:10.880
A: Please...
*Ah, it looks like I'm about to make it*

00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:13.500
O: No, well, 10 million...

00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:16.100
O: ... Is impossible, but...
A: Hmm...!

00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:17.840
O: Well, to be honest...
A: Hmm... Hmm...

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:20.280
O: If it was around 10.000

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:22.720
A: Would you be able to do it if the amount was 10.000?

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:26.060
O: Well, we made a similar campaign in the past. For example, well...

00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:29.720
O: ... We gave 1000 diamonds to 10 people

00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:31.960
O: Something like that
A: I see, ah, but...

00:11:32.380 --> 00:11:34.520
A: ... You made a similar campaign in the past, right?

00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:35.080
O: Yes

00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:37.300
A: 1,000 diamonds for 10 people?

00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:38.780
A: In that case, definitely...

00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:40.280
A: ... For the sake of A.I.Channel...

00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:44.280
A: ... I hope that you, producer, can help me to make the people happy

00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:44.780
O: Yes

00:11:44.780 --> 00:11:46.600
A: In that case, let's multiply that amount by 10

00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:48.040
O: Eh? Well, by 10...

00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:50.940
A: If we multiply it by 10, then the amount of winners will be 100!
O: By 10, well...

00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:54.760
O: Well, I guess that'd be a bit hard

00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:55.800
A: No, impossible...

00:11:55.820 --> 00:11:58.420
A: No, you can't say that it's hard if you haven't even tried it

00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:01.280
A: The power of an adult lies in making possible the things that are impossible

00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:03.220
O: That's right, well...

00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:04.220
A: Right?

00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:06.680
O: 1,000... Hmm.... Well...

00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:10.780
O: If I had to multiply the 2,000 diamonds for 10 people, well...

00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:13.240
O: ... It's a set proportion, it's set, so...

00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:16.280
A: Ah! In that case, could it be 1,000 diamonds for 20 winners?

00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:17.620
O: Ah, that sounds good

00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:19.640
A: Oh! Oh! Yaay!
O: Yes

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:22.260
A: Oh, man, you just said it, right?

00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:25.560
O: Yes, well, it's a set proportion, so, yes

00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:26.420
A: No, but...

00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:28.800
A: You said it, right?
O: Yes, I did

00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:32.780
A: Great! Mission accomplished! I did it!

00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:33.820
A: To tell the truth...

00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:35.400
A: The camera...

00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:38.840
A: ... Was recording and everything is registered

00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:39.620
O: Eh? Ah

00:12:39.620 --> 00:12:41.240
A: The gifts have been decided

00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:43.040
O: Eh? Was it recording?

00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:43.540
A: Yes

00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:45.240
O: Ah, hey, it's not settled yet

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:47.620
O: For now, I’d have to… I’d have to get an approval...

00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:49.020
O: Well...

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:51.240
O: So, well, I'd have to confirm it with my superiors

00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:54.520
A: Aren't you an adult? You have to take responsibility for your words

00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:59.760
A: I know! In the business world, once a fix has been planned, you have to fulfill it

00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:00.980
A: So...

00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:02.800
A: To everyone watching us!

00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:09.280
A: If you take part in the Twitter campaign you'll be one of the 20 winners of 1,000 diamonds!

00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:10.680
A: Yeeees!

00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:13.680
O: Make sure to be a part of it!
A: Oh! Yeeees!

00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:17.080
A: You're definitely a great producer

00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:19.020
O: Thank you very much
A: As expected from you

00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:22.540
A: With that being said, I'll be giving presents in name of the directors!

00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:24.280
A: The negotiator Kizuna Ai...!

00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:26.320
A: ... Has succeeded!

00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:28.700
A: With that being said, should we finish it here?
O: Yes

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:29.660
A: Great!

00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:33.000
A: This was Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai and...!

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.680
O: ... The producer of Valkyrie Connect, Ozekin!

00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:37.680
A: See you soon!

O: Yes?

00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:52.240
A: It's been settled that I'll get diamonds, right?

00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:55.660
O: No, if you want to get diamonds you'll have to participate in the campaign

00:13:55.740 --> 00:13:57.760
