00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.925
Hello Everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai here!

00:00:02.925 --> 00:00:05.300
I've played a lot of games since I've started...

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:09.280
And people said I'm bad at gaming and stuff...

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:13.360
That means "I put a lot of effort on it" to me because I started from zero!

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:15.760
And there are some games that I'm already good at, right?

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:20.160
I thought showing my walkthroughs, guides and reviews...

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.300
In other ways than just showing them in videos would be good! That's why...

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.520
"I am going to make my own website for all my game walkthroughs, guides and reviews!"

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.720
And with that being said, let's do it!

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.860
When you want to make this kind of websites...

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.600
Those HTML... CSS... co...

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:38.300
Codes?

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.540
You have to memorise them right?

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.120
Those must be tough...

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:44.320
But with WIX

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.220
You can create a fabulous website!

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.300
Try to feel it, Wix!

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:51.480
Something like this...

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:53.700
Eh... First of all...

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:56.060
Hoi!

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.460
Let's look through all the templates!

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:01.760
There are so many of them!

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:03.660
Like this...

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
... It is possible...

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.080
... To find modern templates here.

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.020
For example, "Selective store"

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.220
"Photographer briefcase"

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.260
"Constructor Company"

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:14.620
"Beauty salon"!

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:17.380
The most popular templates are...

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:19.820
Is this one good?

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.420
"Graphic Designer", it's great, isn't it?

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:25.660
I'll pick the beauty salon one.

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:26.300
Eh?

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:29.760
Is this the template?

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.040
Ah, it's amazing!

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.400
Ah, those dots in the right side can be moved as well.

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:39.420
*Let's edit the template
Let's edit the template and create the main page*

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.380
I see.
*Let's edit the template
Let's edit the template and create the main page*

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.520
*Let's edit the template
Let's edit the template and create the main page*

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:47.220
Eh? It's amazing, isn't it?

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:52.620
It seems to be a place that you could find anywhere, doesn't it?

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.140
What's another template that I could use?

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:58.660
"Familiar Photos", right? Ah...

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.120
"Yoga Room"

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:01.680
It's something...

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.460
... A pretty simple and relaxing design, it's great, don't you think so?

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:07.860
It makes me feel like I want to sleep.

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.600
I did Yoga too, right?

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:11.880
Meow! Right?

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:14.960
"Online Store"

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.400
What about this one?

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:19.340
Wa... Wa...

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:20.360
Waru...?

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.120
Winta...

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.100
Autumn-Winter?

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:25.100
Eh?

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:35.360
A store.

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.200
Ah! I've seen that before.

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.140
Can you make something like that using a template?

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:43.760
That's amazing.

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.480
Oh! A video!

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:49.840
This is great, isn't it?

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.160
After all, I'll be doing videos as well, right?

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:56.120
It has a style, doesnâ€™t it?

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.640
I want to do something like that.

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:04.520
"About"

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.360
Nice sunglasses.

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:09.020
Home!

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:11.460
I see...

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.460
Well, I saw a lot of them, but...

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.780
... If I keep in mind the page that I want to make this time...

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.840
I think that the "goods" section will be important for sure, so...

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.460
... I think that the "Blog" template should be fine.

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:30.660
Look! Something like this!

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.100
I don't want to sell anything.

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:35.580
I don't even have products.

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:38.000
Ah, yes. Something like that, like that!

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.360
I'll have videogame related stuff.

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.420
I want it to look like this.

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:48.860
I guess it's fine like that, don't you think so?

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:53.680
It's pretty simple and...

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:55.900
... It seems like it's easy to read.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:57.380
It's fine like this, right?

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:01.740
"Don't fail anymore"

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:03.300
"Eyelashes"

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:05.060
I have eyelashes too.

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:10.600
It's fine like that, right?

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:12.820
First, the main page...

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:14.420
That's... How to say it?

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.520
That's the page that you see when you open the website.

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:19.520
The main page should be something likeable, right?

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:27.720
"Main Page"

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.540
I'll definitely write words in english...

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.020
... Because it sounds cool, right?

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:37.020
And like this...

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:38.320
... I'll be classifying articles related with games.

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:42.020
They have to be in order after all, right?

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:46.200
And you can change the order like this.

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:50.400
Like this, maybe?

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:51.680
Good, good.

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:55.220
Alright! For now, I sorted the games by time. I put those that I've been playing recently!

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:57.560
And...

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:59.480
... I can change the background, right?

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:00.480
Hoi!

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.600
"Image"?

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:08.620
I wonder what picture will look better.

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:11.900
It will be over soon, but...

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:15.220
Ah!

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:19.020
This one, definitely! Right?

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:20.920
If we talk about summer, we can't forget about the beach!

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:21.960
Althought it is about to end!

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:26.360
I'll pick the beach wishing that, someday, I could go there.

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:30.360
Well, it doesn't look bad, but...

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:33.840
You can't tell what is this website about, right?

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:36.160
It seems like a Yoga website, right?

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:39.360
So, then...

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:42.460
... I'll definitely use a picture of me.

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:47.360
Wow, I'm definitely cute!

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:49.040
I'm so cute!

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:52.360
The position of the picture is very important.

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:53.920
Like this?

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:55.320
Alright.

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:57.300
And then...

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:00.560
I'll put the title at the height of my eyes.

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:02.400
That's very important, after all.

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:04.560
That's too high, I guess.

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:06.800
Something like that?

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:10.780
But if I place it here, it will cover my face, right?

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:15.160
I'll place it where it can't cover my face.

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:23.340
As a title I'll put...

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:25.640
What could look the best?

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:28.200
For now, I'll make it simple...

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:29.420
Hoi!

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:32.060
I'll put this name for now.

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:35.860
"A.I.GamersInfo (Temporal)", is it fine?

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:39.420
And now...

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:43.600
... I'll put a short description of the website.

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:54.580
A website for...

00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:59.220
... Ai-chan's game reviews...

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:03.340
Calling myself "Ai-chan"...

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:05.180
It's a little corny

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:07.740
Well, I said it so it can't be helped

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:17.300
Yes!

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:19.280
And...

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:20.980
Move this a little...

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:22.780
Bring this to here

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:30.160
What would be a good color for the menu bar?

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:33.220
Ah, but the background is white, so...

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:36.340
As I thought I should go with my color, something pink should be good

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:39.120
What color should I go for?

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:41.920
Good!

00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:47.080
My color~

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.620
Then, the color when someone click on an item will be...

00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:56.880
Dark pink?

00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:08.660
Ok

00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:13.200
Ok-maru!

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:16.280
Even when you click...

00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:20.440
This is 'very pink' isn't it

00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:21.820
Okay, okay

00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:23.780
Good!

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.000
Tada!

00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:33.240
Then

00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:36.180
With this.

00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:38.880
I'm going to make all of it into the background.

00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:41.280
It is so cute.

00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:44.380
Then, here we go!

00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:46.940
*laughs* The profile... this...

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:51.260
It's a woman *laughs* Who is that?

00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:57.280
"Enquiry" It's that, isn't it?

00:08:57.560 --> 00:09:00.215
First, I'll add a lot of things.

00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:03.920
... I changed the name of the template...

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:06.940
... I should decide what to put in the page.

00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:09.240
It feels like...

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:12.860
... It will end up being a different website.

00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:17.460
Links to my social media...

00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:19.320
... That's important.

00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:22.180
When we talk about games...

00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:23.720
That's true! The first game...

00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:26.020
Was that the first game that I played?

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:30.040
For example, surpass the million revivals in Inside.

00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:34.100
But I haven't accomplished that yet, right?

00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:37.660
Well, I have a long way to go... Maybe?

00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:39.200
I wonder how much I need to make it.

00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:44.800
Ah, the links to my social media... I'll put them here.

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:49.540
"Pinterest" and "YouTube"...

00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:51.800
"Instagram"

00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:55.040
I'll put "Google" too.

00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:58.560
I'll delete those ones that I don't need.

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:04.820
I don't have a Pinterest.

00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:06.740
Instagram...

00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:08.640
I don't need Google.

00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:11.180
YouTube, I think I won't need it.

00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:12.900
I don't need it.

00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:16.340
Eh?

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:19.480
Don't I have a YouTube channel? Well, whatever...

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:26.480
Ah, yes, yes. By the way, just as I said before, during the Inside stream...

00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:29.480
... I want to decide what kind of guides I'll be doing.

00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:31.380
Alright!

00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:33.380
I'm done testing out the pink color.

00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:34.660
Okay! Okay!

00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:36.620
And...

00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:41.140
I'm pretty sure that I'll finish all the games that I've been playing.

00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:43.000
So, you know, if I have to make a choice...

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.580
That lady again!

00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:46.300
If I have to make a choice...

00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:47.880
How to say it? Then...

00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:50.580
There's a bunch of games that I'm not good playing at.

00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:55.280
So, it is possible that I write an article calling everyone who is bad playing games like me.

00:10:55.580 --> 00:10:57.340
And, you know, maybe...

00:10:57.540 --> 00:11:01.640
... This could be a new entry to those who know me, so...

00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:03.300
... I would like to...

00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:07.180
... Take advice from people that knows a lot about games.

00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:08.500
Right?

00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:10.580
Ah, you know, for example "Furare Kaihi"...

00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:11.520
How to say it?...

00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:13.360
... There isn't just one way to end the game, but...

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:14.380
... It has special scenes...

00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:15.380
Like, it has a lot branches.

00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:17.020
Right?

00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:18.380
And, that's because...

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:20.280
... Like, for example, someone telling me: "Here, it is better for you to do this"...

00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:23.040
... Or "If you do this, you'll be able to see this ending"

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:25.160
I would be so happy if you tell me something like that.

00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:27.480
I'm done!

00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:28.400
What do you think?

00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:31.460
Don't you think it's lookig good?

00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:34.940
Like, for example, I put the links for A.I.Games and YouTube

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:39.000
And, also, I put the Twitter gadget on the side.

00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:40.700
I also changed the logo!

00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:42.820
Don't you think it looks good?

00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:44.700
And having said that...

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:48.540
I'll try writting an article.

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:53.920
The title will be...

00:11:57.840 --> 00:11:58.800
"Hello"...

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:00.700
"Everyone!"

00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:02.740
It's like my salutation~

00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:05.580
Right, about that ''Hai domo''.

00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:09.040
Since when did I start using it?

00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:10.960
Somehow, now that I think about it...

00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:15.280
Saying ''Hello Everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai here!''

00:12:15.740 --> 00:12:19.260
Seems that it have became my habit.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:22.960
I don't recall it at all.

00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:31.960
There's quite alot of materials which we can use.

00:12:34.460 --> 00:12:38.560
You see, like this, I wish there would be more places like this for communications.

00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:42.100
I will make a comment and blog space in it so.

00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:44.100
Please give me some advices!

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:47.520
Then, after I just decorated it~

00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:49.600
Now it's finnished! Time to publish it!

00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:52.160
Don!

00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:54.600
Oh! It's published~

00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:57.340
Looks good~ Looks good~

00:12:57.620 --> 00:13:00.860
Yes! I just wanted to make it like this~

00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:04.280
Just one regretful thing left...

00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:08.160
The fact that we can't see my picture at all...

00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:12.340
That space where my cute face blinks out!

00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:15.240
No! It looks like it's censored!

00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:17.400
I look like a criminal.

00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:20.500
And, when you scroll up and down like this...

00:13:20.780 --> 00:13:22.460
... Look at my face, please.

00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:23.560
Alright!

00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:24.300
A criminal.

00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:30.940
"Hello everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai here!", somthing like that, right?
*With a distorted voice*

00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:34.700
And I thought that she was a good girl, something like that?

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:36.180
And having said that...

00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:38.380
My website is finally done!

00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:39.540
Yaaaay!

00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:42.900
The name is just a placeholder, so...

00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:45.140
I gotta think about it later.

00:13:45.660 --> 00:13:47.960
Also, regarding the first article...

00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:50.400
... I definitely made it without even thinking what I was gonna write, so...

00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:53.840
... I'll let you know when I post a proper article.

00:13:54.860 --> 00:13:57.180
"Virtual Writer Kizuna Ai"

00:13:57.180 --> 00:13:58.320
Something like that, right?

00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:00.140
Sounds good.

00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:04.300
Oh, man. It's so easy to make a website with WIX, so...

00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:06.080
... For beginners...

00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:09.340
... Remembering tags, this is "a" and then...

00:14:09.740 --> 00:14:12.320
... If you do this using CSS, the color...

00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:14.680
... Well, this is the code...

00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:16.520
It's so tedious...

00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:19.180
... And if you make a mistake...

00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:22.100
Ah! Everything is broken! I didn't want to do that.

00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:23.420
It's possible that it happens to you and...

00:14:23.620 --> 00:14:25.440
... I really recommend it.

00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:27.940
Even a beginner can make their own website using their intuition.

00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:29.400
It's really...!

00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:32.460
â™ª Try to feel it, Wix! â™ª

00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:33.240
Right?

00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:37.700
This was Virtual Writer Kizuna Ai! See you soon!
