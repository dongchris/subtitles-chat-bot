00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:15.580
I love you.

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:26.180
Hey.

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:35.940
How many were there before me?

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.080
What do you mean?

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:43.560
Like

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.340
how many girls did you love before me?

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.400
Love?

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:55.740
Five,

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.280
I loved five women before you.

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.460
What were their names?

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:08.680
WHO.

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:09.400
WHAT.

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:10.220
WHEN.

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:11.120
WHERE.

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.880
WHY.

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.640
Can you tell me about them?

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.180
WHO I loved was a girl from college.

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:33.820
I wasn't exactly close to her, but with some superficial facts and a few interactions over semester.

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.500
You know like most guys fantasizing over a girl they barely know.

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.280
I filled in the blanks like a fairytale author

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.920
and who she became in my head was probably more than the reality.

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.040
She was a third year.

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:50.060
Sorority girl.

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.920
Yeah.

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.040
And I was infatuated freshman, sure but

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.620
the several times we got to spend together outside of class.

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.780
It really allowed me to see she also had a good heart

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.420
and a bright spirit.

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:03.920
The only problem was

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.240
so did just about every other guy,

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.640
and while she turned me down nicely

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:14.960
I swear there were times when it seemed like the clichÃ© sorority girl

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.960
may have felt something for the typical awkward freshman.

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.320
WHAT I loved

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.020
was an old friend,

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.560
but she was much more than just a friend.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.900
We met early in college and kept in touch through the years after.

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:34.780
We saw each other grow and change

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.420
and through multiple relationships.

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.660
I saw her different boyfriends come and go,

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.540
she was also there for every girlfriend

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.320
and breakup of mine.

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.460
Personality, humor, taste.

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.360
It was all there.

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.140
Her and I were almost perfect,

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.080
only thing that wasn't perfect was our timing.

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.360
We were never single at the same time

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:06.820
and what we loved about each other was never enough to leave who we were with.

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.480
This is something we eventually had to face and accept

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:15.200
and we had to leave behind what we had.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:17.300
WHEN I loved

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:19.560
was my first girlfriend in high school.

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:24.040
It's a bit unfair because she embodies the combination of both,

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:25.700
love and youth.

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.920
The feeling of young love is unique

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.740
and impossible to replace or replicate

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.260
because we can only be that age once.

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:40.320
High school is a time of innocence, discovery and adventure.

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:43.400
We share these three elements together in things like

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:45.100
our first kiss,

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.120
late night sneaking out

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.640
and matinee movies.

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:55.560
All of which now have become a nostalgic love.

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:00.500
Preserved in a time that neither of us can touch, but know it's there.

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:03.140
Even though we were just kids,

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:07.020
there is not a doubt in my mind that when we were there,

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:10.500
we were in love.

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:17.660
WHERE I loved

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:19.980
was the girl I met in Los Angeles.

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.840
I never intended to stay there that long.

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.900
It was just a 6 month internship after graduating

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:30.860
but it all changed when I met her.

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:37.120
Soon a year had passed and somehow another year after that.

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:39.660
I couldn't leave the city.

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:41.960
I couldn't leave her.

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:48.240
Maybe it was my desire to be on my own

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.020
or prove something to everyone back at home.

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:57.480
But she helped me accomplish it over there, with a relationship reflective of the city we were in.

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:06.020
A new energy and new experiences that really pushed me to mature more than anyone

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:07.520
or anywhere else.

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:15.160
When people ask what city I love the most, I say L.A.

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:19.220
The city where I loved the most.

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:23.020
WHY I love

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:25.720
was a close friend of mine who passed away.

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:30.420
She told me after she was diagnosed that

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:34.260
death was not what saddened her the most.

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:40.100
But the fact that she never really felt like she had fallen in love.

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:43.060
She wanted to get to have those emotions,

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:44.280
good and bad

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:48.120
of being hurt and of being held.

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:56.580
After she passed those words stuck with me the most.

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:01.660
Teaching me to see that one of the greatest gifts we have of being alive is

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:07.000
the ability to give, receive and even lose love.

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:11.280
There are so many like her,

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:15.860
whose lives end before having any of those experiences.

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:21.280
What a waste if we don't strive to love in our lives.

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:24.360
She made me understand why,

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:28.400
why waste this life not loving.

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:37.180
I understand now.

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:40.780
You were the sixth.

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:44.420
The sixth.

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:46.800
So which one am I then?

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:48.180
You are none of them

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:53.540
because  you are all of them.

00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:58.220
You are who I love.

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:00.060
The girl on the pedestal,

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:01.040
the fantasy,

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:04.440
the make belief things that are actually true.

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:06.400
You are what I love.

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:08.680
The depth, the inside jokes,

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:11.240
the best friend.

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:14.680
You are when I love.

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:17.860
A new history is being started with you.

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:22.680
We are the young lovers our older selves will someday reminisce about.

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:25.160
You are where I love.

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:29.220
Because I'd go anywhere just to be with you.

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:32.660
You are WHY I love.

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:37.700
Because before you I didn't truly understand what I was looking for.

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:39.700
And now that we've found each other,

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:43.940
you've given my past and future meaning.

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:46.120
You are the sixth.

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:50.040
You are the last.

00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:05.940
So,

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:08.600
how many were there before me?

00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:12.640
Five as well.

00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:14.100
What were their names?

00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:23.140
WHO, WHAT, WHEN, WHERE, WHY
