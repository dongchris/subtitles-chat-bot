00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:05.759
Hi everyone, this is Taylor Chan and Mike Bow and they created the short film "In Between". Hope you enjoy!

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.110
Ah, high school...

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:23.549
a time of change, a time of firsts.

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:29.159
It's when I first discovered my interests, when I first developed a sense of humor

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.240
And when I first found my close group of friends.

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:36.580
Okay "Yo mama's so ugly, that when she was born her parents named her shit happened."

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.440
"All right how do Chinese parents name their kids? They throw a pan down the stairs."

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:49.220
...

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:57.030
And that's the first time I felt Asian.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.589
I mean, I knew I was Asian, but it's weird realizing,

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:07.980
I was seen as Asian, which confused me because I always felt like I was the same as them.

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:10.100
They were born here, I was born here,

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.360
Even my parents were born here, but

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.140
Being the only Asian in school brought along

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.549
special treatment

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:20.549
So how much do we owe?

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:23.490
Leo's got this

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.140
Here you go.

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.780
(Not all Asians are good at math)

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.880
uhh Falco? No...Samus?

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.800
Wait. What the f*ck is this?

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:38.581
Oh lucario.

00:01:38.581 --> 00:01:39.210
Who?

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:40.680
He's a Pokemon.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.640
Oh you would watch anime

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:45.620
I'm Samus.

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.420
I tried.
Yeah, we really were not prepared.

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.999
Yeah. I think I could have read that PowerPoint a little more.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.240
Hey, you're supposed to be the one that's good at these things.

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:58.240
Hey, uhhh

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:59.979
Listen, do you have a...

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:01.979
Date to the homecoming dance?

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.020
Ughh no

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:07.079
Wait why?

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:07.880
(GO FOR IT)

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.540
Oh!

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:14.639
Leo, really? Come on! We wouldn't be a good match

00:02:14.639 --> 00:02:16.160
*REJECTED*

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.180
for the dance, right?

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.790
Wait... Why?

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.380
You know... We're just different

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:26.520
*horn honks*

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:29.420
Um see you later...

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.920
See ya

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:35.120
So did you hear? Apparently Asian means different.

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.459
I was different

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.360
Until now!

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:05.330
I was off to college and not just any ordinary college. A college in Southern California!

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.169
Do you know what that means? Let me break it down for you.

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:12.349
UC San Gabriel

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:16.300
57.9% Asian!

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:22.370
Let's just say 60... 60% Asian. That's more than half the school of people like me!

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:26.120
I was always "too" Asian back home because I was the only one

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:28.910
not here!

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:33.560
We all Asian, baby!

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:44.449
College. This is where I discover where I fit in. This is where I discover where I belong

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.470
Hey you

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:51.798
Yeah, we're having a rush party tonight at Alpha Zeta Nu

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:56.160
It's the Asian fraternity.

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:58.480
I'll be there

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:22.880
신발! (shoes!)

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:24.200
Yeah?

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.480
Shoes

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:33.160
*Come on now. How do you not know that?!?*

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:44.230
Hey

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:46.230
You look really familiar

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:48.200
Do I?

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.780
yeah

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:53.278
Hey, Julie, doesn't this guy look like Jeff Chang?

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:55.180
I think you mean Jeff Cheung

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:56.920
Or is it Ching?

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:58.240
Ching?

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:00.560
Sounds almost like a pan getting thrown down the stairs

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:02.220
WOw... *offended*

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:06.100
Oh my god...

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:16.030
Woah... Is this anime?

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:18.930
Yeah, Tokyo Ghoul

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:21.160
Never heard of it

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:24.660
Strange. Quite the anime expert back home.

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:26.527
Oh, yeah? What'd you watch?

00:05:26.527 --> 00:05:27.480
Dragon Ball. Pokémon.

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:28.840
Ha!

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:32.300
Did you watch subbed or dubbed?

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:34.990
What's subbed?

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:36.820
What's subbed?

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:39.139
Man get out of here, Goku.

00:05:39.139 --> 00:05:41.369
Get out of here! Let's go

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:48.390
What the fuck is going on?

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:51.360
Subtitles

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:52.250
Sorry?

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:57.020
Subtitles - those words at the lower third of the screen that give context to the scene.

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:00.740
you know, something you desperately needed tonight whitey

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:04.140
Whitey. I am NOT white trust me...

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:07.589
It's not second nature for you to take your shoes off indoors

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:11.140
You use that played out and frankly offensive pan joke

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:15.600
And the only anime you watch are Dragon Ball and Pokémon

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:17.650
Dubbed

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:19.650
Sounds pretty white to me Pillsbury

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:24.560
No you just don't understand

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:28.320
Oh really?

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:30.990
May I?

00:06:33.099 --> 00:06:36.628
And I was different back home because I was too Asian

00:06:36.879 --> 00:06:40.289
But those things that made me Asian back home are supposed to make me fit in here

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:44.759
You're kind of doing what your white friends did to you

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:47.499
What are you talking about?

00:06:47.499 --> 00:06:51.929
Well, your white friends pushed you away on the basis that you're Asian

00:06:52.809 --> 00:06:56.759
But you're trying to connect with these people on the basis that they're Asian

00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:00.460
You're just reducing people to their race

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:03.240
It's no different from your friends back home

00:07:05.559 --> 00:07:07.878
No no no

00:07:07.878 --> 00:07:10.458
no I...

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:16.020
Wait right here

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:31.240
Check it!

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:36.600
I just got that girl's number over there. We connected. I didn't bring up race

00:07:36.669 --> 00:07:38.349
We'll see

00:07:38.349 --> 00:07:40.349
Gotta go. Later, Charmin (the toilet paper brand)!

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:52.280
So what do you think

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:53.599
Huh?

00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:56.380
oh!

00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:59.200
These are amazing

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:01.420
The photography department's lucky to have you

00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:03.140
oh

00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:08.100
No, not a photography major. My passion's photography, but I'm actually a bio major

00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:09.600
oh

00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:13.280
Well if it's your passion maybe you should switch majors

00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:17.020
No my parents would never let me do that

00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:18.079
why not?

00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:21.830
It's your dream, right?

00:08:22.530 --> 00:08:24.626
You should be honest with your parents.

00:08:24.626 --> 00:08:28.549
Are you kidding me? They would never support me in that kind of field

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:31.631
huh, they're your parents. I'm sure they'll understand.

00:08:31.631 --> 00:08:32.175
No they won't

00:08:32.175 --> 00:08:32.929
why wouldn't they?

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:36.200
Why won't you?

00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:42.680
Maybe we're just different

00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:07.700
You were right. What do I do?

00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:13.520
Listen...

00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:18.320
Maybe you just have to learn to accept that you're different from everyone

00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:23.520
You feel like you don't belong here

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:26.080
or there

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:29.280
You just fall somewhere in between

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:33.480
It's not necessarily a bad thing

00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:36.980
Not a bad thing?

00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:38.900
I have no one

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:45.520
Wait where are you going?

00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:48.880
Back to at least some familiarity

00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:01.620
Rush party tonight check it out.

00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:02.660
Yeah

00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:03.940
heard Karen's coming

00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:05.140
I'll sign up

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:11.589
First frat

00:10:11.589 --> 00:10:14.560
Nah... I actually checked out Alpha Zeta Nu last night

00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:15.560
ah

00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:17.060
Should have known

00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:19.120
God, there are too many Asian kids at this school

00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:20.460
Too many.

00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:21.900
Why don't they just go back home already

00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:24.560
That's fucked up

00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:26.500
What'd you say bro?

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:30.320
I said that's fucked up!

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:33.100
You guys, you guys don't get it, do you?

00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:35.580
this is as much as their home as it is yours

00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:40.229
And you know it's statements like these that make it hard for people like me to find a home in the first place

00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:45.920
so if you don't get that, then maybe you, you should go back home to... to Norway

00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:49.160
or Slovakia

00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:51.180
Or wherever the hell you come from you ignoramus

00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:54.440
*sighs*

00:10:55.540 --> 00:10:58.400
Whoa, 
Hey man, you okay?

00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:01.550
Yeah, I'm fine

00:11:01.550 --> 00:11:03.900
Yeah, that really sucks with those guys said to you back there,

00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:06.400
But it takes a lot of balls to respond the way you did

00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:07.960
Props, man

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:09.179
Thanks

00:11:09.179 --> 00:11:11.500
Yeah, so what are you?

00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:14.840
Chinese

00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:17.940
No no, I mean, are you a freshman, sophomore...?

00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:19.300
Oh!

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:21.100
Freshman

00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:27.250
Ah. Not the best first impression of us here at UCSG. Just don't hold it against us

00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:29.540
Kyle!

00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:30.520
Hey man, what's up?

00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:32.320
How's it going?
Good!

00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:34.200
Oh shit. It's you.

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:36.240
What you guys know each other?

00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:37.680
yeah, he was at the party last night

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:40.559
Why'd you dip so early? You missed the jello shots, bro

00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:43.860
Didn't think anyone noticed

00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:48.929
We're actually about to head to this alumni homecoming event if you want to tag along

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:51.600
They got free tacos

00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:56.520
Yeah, I'll meet you guys there, I just have to take care of some stuff first

00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:57.508
Okay, adios man

00:11:57.508 --> 00:11:58.620
Yeah!
See ya there

00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:04.020
Nicely done

00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:06.555
I learned from the best

00:12:06.555 --> 00:12:08.159
Tough being an in-betweener, huh?

00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:11.780
Wait, you're one too?

00:12:11.780 --> 00:12:13.380
Yep, Michigan

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:16.400
I went through all the same things you did when I first moved here

00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:19.580
Well, didn't tell someone to go back to Norway

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:22.540
But same frustrations...

00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:25.900
Took me a lot longer to feel like I fit in

00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:28.940
Speaking of which, you should get to that event

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:33.820
Whoa wait, what else can you tell me? You're the first person in this place who I...

00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:39.180
I just don't want to make a fool out of myself

00:12:39.180 --> 00:12:40.100
Again!

00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:44.760
Okay fine

00:12:45.770 --> 00:12:47.480
I'll help you

00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:49.540
Although it seems like you don't really need my help.

00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:52.800
I mean you got that invite to the homecoming event all by yourself

00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:56.560
See you later. Hey, enjoy the in-between

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:00.260
Huh

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:06.760
The in-between. I guess I was still right about college. I did find where I belong

00:13:07.310 --> 00:13:13.929
I was just a little misguided to think I needed to force myself into one community when in reality

00:13:14.270 --> 00:13:16.270
I can belong to many

00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:19.500
and really, the best things fall in between

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:24.040
sandwich meat, Oreo filling, Empire Strikes Back

00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:30.260
It's not what I expected, but I think I can get used to this

00:13:34.820 --> 00:13:40.600
Well I first want to say congratulations, I'm really proud of you guys for making this. This was obviously a very big

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:44.080
Production and project that you guys took on completely

00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:48.260
like on the side of everything that you guys already doing, so good job, like honestly

00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:49.660
Thanks, thank you

00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:51.680
For the most part it was a pretty small scale production.

00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:54.800
it felt big
but like it was like a large-scale story.

00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:55.660
Right, right.

00:13:55.660 --> 00:13:59.040
Well. I mean what like what was the genesis of this project?

00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:01.780
Why did you guys want to make it or what was the original intention?

00:14:01.780 --> 00:14:05.600
So it actually started about a year ago when there was this film contest.

00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:08.000
things circulated amongst our community.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:13.400
It was a call-out for Asian filmmakers to make entries about Asian identity.

00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:17.010
We shared it with each other and we thought maybe we can make something for this contest

00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:22.160
We're thinking of a story to tell them. The best idea we came up with was an experience that we shared as

00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:24.300
multi-generational Asians

00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:29.460
Oh okay. So was this story actually pretty personal to you guys like you actually like went through

00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:36.000
This identity crisis that you know that were you actually like kind of your character at some point in your life?

00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:42.330
That opening joke of Leo laughing at the joke and the friends that happen to do yeah, yeah

00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:47.189
That's because it's just so interesting because yeah from being multi-generational Asians, we're not necessarily

00:14:47.529 --> 00:14:49.889
You know raised any differently, right?

00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:54.509
It's funny growing up, and then you're like oh, no we see you as as different though

00:14:54.970 --> 00:14:58.170
And then we're talking with friends and there were just a lot of

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:00.400
similar

00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:05.100
funny instances of feeling like too Asian amongst non-Asians

00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:08.489
And then not feeling not Asian enough amongst Asians.

00:15:09.180 --> 00:15:13.020
But that's that's the struggle already like right there where it's like what what even is

00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:15.480
"too Asian" or "Asian enough" right and like yeah

00:15:15.490 --> 00:15:19.979
It's unfortunate that just because of how you look, people are just gonna think you need to be this way right

00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:20.310
Yeah

00:15:20.310 --> 00:15:21.089
I mean

00:15:21.089 --> 00:15:27.809
I'm glad that you guys told this story and brought your perspective cuz I remember the first time I watched it

00:15:27.810 --> 00:15:34.679
I was like oh my gosh. Do I make you feel this way cuz cuz I've teased you guys before. I'm first-generation

00:15:34.930 --> 00:15:38.640
You know you guys multi-generational you guys your fans have been in America for a long time

00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:42.840
And I've teased you guys about being "Asian enough" or whatever. I'm like oh no!

00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:44.980
it's just an entire passive-aggressive film at Phil

00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:50.420
that's all but no it's it's great that you guys brought your you know your own story and I'm glad

00:15:50.420 --> 00:15:55.140
That you know people can watch and see something that I think is a story that is not that common in our community

00:15:55.140 --> 00:16:01.080
It seemed like a very big undertaking and it seemed like there was like more than you wanted to tell

00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:01.880
we definitely like

00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:05.940
Realize that through making it to like we're trying to tackle this big

00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:10.399
topic which is assimilation and there's a lot to cover, a lot of

00:16:10.830 --> 00:16:16.999
Topics within that that we could venture into, but we just knew that we can only scratch the surface of it so

00:16:17.780 --> 00:16:25.120
hopefully it was a nice light-hearted step into that topic it is a very deep and

00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:27.770
And nuanced and heavy topic

00:16:27.770 --> 00:16:31.640
And I think you guys approached it in a nice light-hearted way and hopefully like

00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:36.080
Maybe you guys can continue the story and get like you know get further into it.

00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:37.520
Meet the other in-betweeners

00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:42.460
Yeah, well I think you guys did a great job, and I hope everyone watching really enjoyed it as well

00:16:43.380 --> 00:16:45.380
Yeah, we want to see more from you guys

00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:48.419
More, hopefully more Michael Bow and Taylor Chan.

00:16:48.419 --> 00:16:49.190
Don't speak for them

00:16:50.340 --> 00:16:52.260
Why would you speak for them?

00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:54.319
They don't, they didn't say that

00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:58.219
