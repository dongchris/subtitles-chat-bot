Hello everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai here!

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.440
Thanks for coming to see my livestream!

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:12.160
I didn't arrive late today!

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:13.320
I did it!

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.840
Good afternoon! Thank you all for coming!

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:21.300
Both to those who always watch me, and those who watch me for the first time, have a lot of fun!

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:23.160
And now then...

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:24.620
Today...

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.560
...I have an important announcement to me regarding me

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.660
Maybe people have already noticed, but...

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Formally...

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.460
...Today, November 9th...

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.740
My LINE stamps were launched!

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:46.460
Over a year...

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.960
Probably around December last year...

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.780
...I said that I’d like to launch my stamp collection, but...

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.160
Finally! Finally!

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.960
I was able to launch my stamp collection!
Thank you very much!

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.840
Man, I’m so happy!

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.240
And I worked hard to make them!

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.000
I said before that I wanted go make them, but...

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:09.980
Really...

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.900
Since the day that it was decided that I could launch them until today...

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.420
...Taking into account that I talk a lot when something good happens...

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.600
...It took a lot for me to stay quiet and not say anything

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.235
"I announced it to my acquaintances" Ahh! Thank you very much! "Congratulations"

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:26.520
Thank you very much, really

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.960
That's right, it looks like more people than I thought bought my stamps, so then...

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:34.020
It turns out that... maybe these will be the LINE stamps "stars"?

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:34.940
In Japan, well...

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:37.380
I’m not sure about the ranking on the outside,  but...

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.140
...Regarding the ranking in Japan...

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.120
It turns out that I reached 4th place!

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.020
Man...!

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.120
It really makes me happy!

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:48.340
“Good afternoon, this is the first time I watch you, but congratulations”

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:49.400
Thank you very much!

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:53.380
Origami DJ-san: "Congratulations for the LINE stamps", Thank you very much!

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.640
"Good day, good day!", Fuurinkazan-san
Thank you very much!

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.240
Man, it really makes me happy that so many people have bought them...

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:00.180
"Will you take out a second collection?"

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.320
Eeeh? Well...

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.180
If all of you...

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:07.560
Eh? Will it be fine?

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:11.140
Is it working? It looks like I got disconnected for an instant

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:12.560
Is it working? Good...

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.900
Man, well...

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.020
Regarding a second part...

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:17.160
Well...

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:20.140
If everyone uses them a lot...

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.320
...Then it could be possible

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.340
"It's the first time that I watch you, good afternoon"
Good afternoon!

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:25.920
"From Vietnam", Thank you very much!

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.240
Really, I always receive messages from Japan, from Vietnam...

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.560
Well... from the US, from India, from a lot of places...

00:02:32.565 --> 00:02:33.935
Thank you everyone!

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.020
"I don't use LINE but I’d like to buy them"

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.480
Thank you very much for the intention, it makes me very happy!

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:40.800
"I bought the stamps!"

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.960
Takanashi Shinobu-san, thank you very much!

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.120
Eh? Someone from Korea, I’m sorry, I don’t understand Korean

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.220
I still can’t read it, but...

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.960
...I’m very sorry that I also can’t read your name, really, thank you very much!

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.880
"I sent a stamp to my friend and they blocked me"

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:58.080
How is that possible? Eh? But... Ah, I see...!

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.100
You sent a lot of stamps at once

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:01.160
I see

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.920
Ah, but...

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.380
It looks like, LINE...

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.480
Well, it has a ranking of how many people bought the stamps, but...

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.220
...There also exists a usage ranking, so then...

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:12.040
Well...

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:16.640
I would be very happy if you press them, if possible and without causing too much trouble!

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.700
I’d like to work hard to reach 1st place!

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.820
"Congratulations", Tennen Suterusu-san,
Thank you very much!

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.640
It looks like there's a lot more comments, thank you very much

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.180
"What, guys, anime?" Mmm... well...

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:30.680
"Guys, anime"

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.320
"Nice guy"

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:33.500
Mmm...

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.100
An anime is...

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.040
Eh? Which is it?

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.520
An anime, right?

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:40.860
Well...

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:43.180
Wait...

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.980
Wait...

00:03:45.245 --> 00:03:46.420
Which is it?

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:49.260
As always, I recommend the same, well...

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:51.880
In the case, well... it's somewhat old...

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.000
Maybe not from a long time ago, but...

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.080
..."Seto no Hanayome" is a lot of fun

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:59.400
"It's the first time I see you!", thank you very much!

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.380
"Good day Ai-chan", good day!

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:03.520
"I’m sorry Ai-chan, I don’t use LINE"

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:07.160
Don’t worry, it makes me very happy congratulating me

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:12.780
I really appreciate it everyone, both to those that bought my stamps...

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.780
...Along with those who congratulated me

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:16.920
Install face? Good, here I go

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:18.980
Instaaaaall!

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.360
Well, I installed the affection sent to me

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:26.800
"Good day from Russia", good day!

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.200
"Kizuna Ai Forever" Thank you!

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:30.380
Yaaay!

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.820
That's right, I can go live
(Responding to someone who asked how was it possible for her to go live)

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:36.940
That's right, maybe Seto No Hanayome isn’t fun?

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:41.220
I saw it recently, but, San-chan is adorable, right?

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:43.000
"Annyeonghaseyo, good afternoon"

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.040
Good afternoon!

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.940
"The first time I saw you..." Ah, it was Nico Nico Douga!

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:48.220
Thank you very much!

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:52.080
It's true, I have a Nico Nico Douga account although I lately I haven't uploaded anything

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:53.920
Well, when they banned me...

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:56.880
...I decided to create an account there to take refuge...

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:59.260
Well, I did that

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:02.200
If you want, you can connect there too

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:07.060
It definitely has a different way than YouTube to show comments, so please check it out

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:08.840
"Say my name, please!" Ucchan-san!

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:10.560
I read it

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:11.540
*evil laugh*

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:15.120
"The connection is somewhat unstable"

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:16.180
Man, I see...

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:18.520
Livestreaming is definitely hard

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:21.280
Really, I know that I’ll only advance little by little, but...

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:23.740
...I’ll work harder

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:24.500
Ah, it's true

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:28.320
The video transmission is too low

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:30.460
What's going on?

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:32.840
Will it be fine?

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:33.600
Eh?

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:35.560
Will the stream break again?

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:37.640
I want it to not cut

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:40.240
I want it to not cut

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:43.680
It won't cut? Ah, but I think it's fine now!

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:45.220
Good! Let's keep going like that

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:47.400
"Can you say my name?" Shiroi Kitsune
(White fox)

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:48.600
Byakko!

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:50.140
It reads "Byakko", right?

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:51.500
Byakko!

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:52.120
Nonchan-san!

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:55.400
"It's too slow, I can’t send comments"

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:57.120
I’m reading it, thank you very much!

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:58.720
Really, thank you so much everyone!

00:05:58.860 --> 00:05:59.700
It makes me very happy

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:00.540
“From the"

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:02.600
"Part"

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:04.100
Eh? What language is this?

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:06.060
Fren... is it French?

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:08.020
"I love you" Thank you!

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:10.540
"Are you low on energy?"

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:14.260
It turns out that I am so happy today, that because I’m being so happy...

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:16.140
It's like...

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:17.600
...Contrary to normal, I calm down

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:19.080
Contrary to how I am normally

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:25.380
It's true, when I thought:
"Ah, I really launched my stamps"

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:28.300
And also: "Eh? Everyone is using it?" Well...

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:30.700
It made me surprisingly happy, but...

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:33.720
...It's not that I can’t assume reality, but...

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:37.040
...I took it very calmly

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:38.600
That's right

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:39.120
And now then…

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:42.700
Ah, it's true! There’s something I want to say first

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.300
When last month, I said I’d accept suggestions for a new "ending"...

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:49.480
...I received a lot of proposals from all of you

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:50.380
And actually...

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:51.620
...I’m choosing one

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:53.900
Really, really thank you very much!

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:56.800
And now I’ll be in charge of editing it in my videos

00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:00.040
But since I received a lot more proposals than I thought

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:04.800
To tell you the truth, I still can't decide

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:07.420
So then I’d appreciate if you give me a bit more time

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:08.940
If... if you can...

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:12.120
I’ll work hard to launch it as soon as possible!
Thank you so much for sending so many proposals!

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:15.360
"How many proposals did you get?"
Wait until the video comes out

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:16.540
Wait anxiously for it!

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:19.360

Good! And now...

00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:37.520
That's right!

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:42.760
Not only did I want to make this livestream to announce my LINE stamps!

00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:44.880
This is what I wanted to do!

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:46.220
Chaaaan!

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:51.040
I prepared this for today

00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:52.800
This is my...

00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:54.540
Design of a new attire!

00:07:57.900 --> 00:07:58.820
What do you think?

00:07:58.995 --> 00:08:01.180
I have two different outfits, but...

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:02.000
What do you think?

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:07.780
And first, to tell you the truth, when I was thinking of a new outfit...

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:09.700
I noticed...

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:12.560
...That it's rather hard

00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:18.020
And just as you guys know, my outfit has always been this, right?

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:21.620
Well, Morikura drew it, he designed it

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:26.820
I think this sailor blouse and shorts are adorable clothes, but...

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:31.160
...I was thinking that I’d like to try out another outfit

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:31.940
So then...

00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:34.960
...When I thought which outfit would fit me best

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:40.240
Thinking it’d be best to consult with the people who habitually see me everyday

00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:42.880
I thought? I meant to say "I thought"

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:46.740
That's how I came up with doing a livestream

00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:52.020
I was thinking if something like that was alright...

00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:54.100
And I drew it, but...

00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:56.080
What do you think? Definitely...

00:08:56.420 --> 00:08:57.460
Leave the belly button...

00:08:58.060 --> 00:09:01.380
...In the open, I thought it’d be best

00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:05.080
That’s right, I should leave the belly button in the open, that’s right

00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:07.140
And well, I drew it in an instant... Ah!

00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:09.480
Thank you very much Gasta Honyakuka-san!

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:12.180
And you know...

00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:14.560
Well, actually if I had to say it...

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:17.380
...I do have a sailor suit, right?

00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:18.200
It's because of that, that...

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:22.320
It'd be useful... I definitely have an appearance of someone that’s 16 years old, so then...

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:23.720
Taking that into account...

00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:27.420
I definitely thought that a type of uniform would fit me well

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:29.780
And now this suit doesn’t have sleeves, so then...

00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:30.840
To make use of the occasion...

00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:33.540
I was thinking of making one with long sleeves

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:37.260
So then it came out this way, it's a blazer, right?

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:42.000
And... if you ask me why it doesn't have color...

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.140
Well...

00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:47.040
I’m not good at painting, so then...

00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:51.380
It can be said that I have no skill for painting

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:52.580
Right?

00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:54.280
Let's say it's something like that

00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:55.800
That's right

00:09:56.060 --> 00:09:57.220
It's a big problem

00:09:57.520 --> 00:09:58.620
Man...

00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:01.220
The people who draw...

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:02.880
Are incredible, right?

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:03.700
I...

00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:05.060
I can't... I can’t paint

00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:08.400
I have the impression that color is the most important part of a drawing, right?

00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:12.060
"What’s your favorite anime?"

00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:15.320
Eh? Which would it be? My favorite anime...

00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:17.000
I have a lot that I like, but...

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:21.500
Eeehhhh...

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:22.860
Toradora!

00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:23.800
Maybe Toradora?

00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:25.220
Well...

00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:27.180
I like that scene...

00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:29.095
I like a lot of scenes, but...

00:10:29.095 --> 00:10:31.155
When Minorin...

00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:34.020
Chose Taiga...

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:37.180
And says: "So then you were like that?"

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:40.820
And well, Taiga-san starts to run away like that

00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:43.380
Confiding on her but it's painful so then she confronts...

00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:45.200
...But ends up running away

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:48.540
That scene of adolescence is irresistible, right?

00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:50.780
I also want to experience adolescence

00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:52.760
"Good afternoon from Taiwan" Good afternoon!

00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:53.760
Thank you very much!

00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:55.320
Info...

00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:57.160
Info... ma...

00:10:58.160 --> 00:10:59.280
Information!

00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:02.760
High-san! High? Is it High-san? Thank you very much!

00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:05.360
They say: "Let's be enthusiastic! Let's be enthusiastic!" It's adorable, right?

00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:07.160
I have a lot of energy!

00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:08.800
It's Rin-chan, Rin-chan

00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:11.640
Ah, regarding the new song at the end of the videos

00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:12.800
Actually...

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:14.360
...I’m finding myself picking them

00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:19.980
I’ll work hard, even though I received a lot more marvelous songs than I thought from you guys

00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:25.620
So then I’m finding it hard editing them and I still haven't decided

00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:27.480
It's because of that, that...

00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:30.780
I’ll work hard to be able to publish it up to this month... I meant, during this month...

00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:31.720
I’ll work hard, so then...

00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:33.840
Hold on a bit more!

00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:35.660
I’m very sorry!

00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:39.920
Ah, in moments like these, please don't forget to use the stamp that says "I’m sorry", right?

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:41.040
And now then...

00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:42.320
Yes, yes, yes...

00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:47.280
I was wondering if you guys wanted me to use some outfit in particular

00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:50.820
That's right, that’s the question that I wanted to ask you guys the most today

00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:52.300
For example...

00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:53.020
Hmm...

00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:55.440
A maid outfit

00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:57.300
A nurse outfit

00:11:57.520 --> 00:11:59.120
A bunny outfit?

00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:01.120
Something of that style?

00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:02.520
Pyoko, pyoko, pyoko!
(Pyoko pyoko is what her headband is called)

00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:04.720
Pyoko... Girl Pyoko Pyoko? Hmm...? Hmm...

00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:08.720
And well, it's because of that, that I wanted to hear your opinion

00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:09.800
"Alice in Wonderland"!

00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:11.480
"A naked apron underneath"! What you say?

00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:13.000
Ah, "socks up to the knees"!

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.600
It's true, there’s also socks up to the knees, right?

00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:16.980
"Black school outfit"

00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:18.100
Ah, I see

00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:19.540
After all, I’m dressed in white, right?

00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:20.500
I see, I see

00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:21.260
“Bathing suit"!

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:22.020
"Bunny cosplay"

00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:23.840
Ah, "Hood sweater" it can be!

00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:24.840
I’d like to wear one

00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:25.980
Ah, a Chinese outfit!

00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:28.320
Well, clothes from around the world... it's true...

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.520
The clothing of Japan is the kimono, right?

00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:35.720
Well, all the clothes from around the world is amazing

00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:38.580
Right? I’d like to use traditional clothing, it's adorable

00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:41.360
"A white boy's school uniform", I see

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:45.220
It must be that, that a woman ... someone with the appearance of a woman dressed in that way...

00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:47.180
Well, it excites them?

00:12:47.740 --> 00:12:49.380
"Gothic Lolita"! I see

00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:51.340
I want to wear clothes by Keyakizaka!

00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:53.360
Yes, but... yes, now that I think about it...

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:55.700
Since I like Keyakizaka46...

00:12:55.700 --> 00:12:58.620
I thought it’d be good to use an outfit similar to the ones they use

00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:02.680
For example, I thought I could wear a long skirt, but...

00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:04.105
Definitely...

00:13:04.105 --> 00:13:07.060
I thought a long skirt wouldn't fit me well

00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:08.040
That's right... Ah!

00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:10.300
"Clothing set in the Taisho era" It's great, it's adorable, right?
(1912 to 1926)

00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:11.480
"A great dress"

00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:13.720
I’d like to wear an outfit that moves with the wind

00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:16.580
It's true, it's true, I see...

00:13:16.580 --> 00:13:20.140
But in general, everyone has a similar opinion, maybe?

00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:21.480
"Monkey"

00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:22.240
Oh, "Pajama"! Ah...

00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:23.360
A pajama! A coat!

00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:24.520
A coat is very lovely, right?

00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:25.680
Oh!

00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:26.420
Well...

00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:30.880
Later I'll make sure to check for any unread suggestions in the chat

00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:32.420
Eh? Really thank you so much for so many suggestions!

00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:33.220
A "White coat"!

00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:34.540
I see

00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:37.740
A kimono is also fine! Right?

00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:41.060
Man, I’d like to change outfits with the different seasons

00:13:41.060 --> 00:13:43.520
Eh? In this case... for example...

00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:44.780
One time...

00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:46.400
For example, a bathing suit...

00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:47.820
What would it be...

00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:49.880
A bathing suit...

00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:51.400
Well...

00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:53.320
...Even if it isn’t seasonal

00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:55.120
Well, something that looks pretty...

00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:56.840
Throughout the year...

00:13:58.120 --> 00:13:59.200
Something like that...

00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:01.720
If it went something like that...

00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:03.220
What clothes would be adequate?

00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:06.060
What clothes would be adequate?

00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:07.860
The "Chima jeogori" is adorable, right?
(Traditional Korean outfit)

00:14:09.580 --> 00:14:10.880
“Santa Claus outfit"!

00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:13.940
Now that the month coming up is December, right?

00:14:14.540 --> 00:14:19.140
How has the year 2017 been treating all of you?

00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:23.640
In my case, the year has passed by so quickly...

00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:25.420
That it surprised me!

00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:27.740
Well now... right? Now...

00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:30.720
During December, I... Hmm....?

00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:32.020
I didn't mean to say "obedient"
(Word confusion)

00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:34.900
Since the first day of December...

00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:37.440
I started to upload videos on YouTube, but...

00:14:37.660 --> 00:14:38.620
Now... right?

00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:43.900
When I thought there was only a month for that day to come around again, I was surprised

00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:46.740
Priestess"? Ah, priestess, I like!

00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:48.480
I see...

00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:49.900
"A common sweater"

00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:51.760
Ah, do you have an obsession with the sweaters? An obsession?

00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:54.060
♪ Nico nico nii! ♪

00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:55.820
I love Nico Ni!

00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:57.960
"A fashion shirt" Eh?

00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:00.040
How would a fashion shirt be like?

00:15:01.620 --> 00:15:02.980
"...That has your headband" Ah!
(In the chat it said: "A hood sweater that has your headband")

00:15:02.980 --> 00:15:04.520
I see, that I didn't have it here...!

00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:06.540
...Instead my headband is on the sweater

00:15:06.885 --> 00:15:07.885
Something like that?

00:15:08.525 --> 00:15:09.525
Will it be like that?

00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:11.800
"Leader of a juvenile delinquent band"

00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:15.660
Who was a leader of a juvenile delinquent band? A leader...

00:15:16.275 --> 00:15:19.185
Well, they’re the people that say: "Yooo, yooo", right?

00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:23.020
"Ai-chan, a lot of time has passed" thank you very much!

00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:24.420
“Don’t stop now"!

00:15:24.420 --> 00:15:25.500
I’m very sorry!

00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:28.140
"An open hood sweater"

00:15:28.140 --> 00:15:29.100
An open hood sweater

00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:34.780
Ah! Perhaps referring to those sweaters that have the front as a normal garment?

00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:37.000
"Boat captain"

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:38.360
Ah, it's adorable, right?

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:40.400
Very good, very good

00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:40.920
Ahh...

00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:43.240
Really, thank you so much for all your comments

00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:45.100
"A garter belt"

00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:46.880
It's great, right? It's very sensual, right?

00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:50.940
Ah, it's true, first off, my hairstyle... well, a ponytail...

00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:53.800
I think some twintails wouldn't feel right...

00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:56.055
Well, I think it might fit me well, but...

00:15:56.060 --> 00:15:57.200
It might fit me well, but...

00:15:57.260 --> 00:16:00.100
Well... instead of twintails... but, I think...

00:16:00.180 --> 00:16:01.600
A ponytail...

00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:05.180
...I think it would fit me better

00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:08.740
“A hood sweater and cat ears"! It's adorable, right? Definitely

00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:10.920
"Two side up"

00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:12.240
"Two side up"

00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:14.580
Two sides upwards?

00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:15.820
Would they be some twintails?

00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:18.780
Two sides upwards? Upwards?

00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:21.200
"Ponytail"

00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:22.920
"Delinquent"!

00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:24.200
Delinquent

00:16:25.060 --> 00:16:25.880
Hey!

00:16:26.495 --> 00:16:29.715
Hey! Hey! Hey! Well...

00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:32.180
Hey... well... hey...

00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:34.040
Listen you guys!

00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:37.200
What kind of funny comment are you saying?

00:16:38.620 --> 00:16:40.880
Go buy me yakisoba bread

00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:42.540
It's not like that?

00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:45.260
Man, I’m a good girl, so then...

00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:48.380
I’m a good girl, so I can't act as a delinquent

00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:51.880
“A wedding dress"!

00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:53.560
I also...

00:16:53.740 --> 00:16:55.860
Could marry?

00:16:56.100 --> 00:16:56.900
Marriage!

00:16:57.300 --> 00:16:58.320
Marriage...

00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:00.300
Do I have someone...?

00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:02.780
With who to marry?

00:17:02.780 --> 00:17:03.980
Marriage

00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:08.820
Would I marry the "Random Word Generator"?

00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:11.480
NO! NO! NO! NO! NO!

00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:13.040
Ah, ah, no...

00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:15.200
It’s not a recording, you’re seeing it live

00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:17.940
"Yaki... Yaki... saba kan"

00:17:17.940 --> 00:17:19.420
Ya... yakisaba bread?

00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:22.900
Eh? Mackerel bread? What does that taste?

00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:25.745
In fact, what does bread taste?

00:17:25.745 --> 00:17:28.120
Eh? The food... the food intrigues me!

00:17:28.660 --> 00:17:30.940
"Tsutsu tsuuu tsu tsu tsu"

00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:32.460
Morse code?

00:17:32.820 --> 00:17:34.360
"Good afternoon from Russia"

00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:36.100
Good afternoon! Thank you very much!

00:17:36.540 --> 00:17:40.620
Ah, twintails... right? But twintails... maybe it's because you’re male

00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:43.160
Yes, it's because you’re male, right? Yes, yes

00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:46.400
And then... Ah, listen, listen, it's true, it's true! Eh?

00:17:46.620 --> 00:17:49.580
Regarding this, what color would fit well?

00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:50.620
I definitely think...

00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:55.440
I said black or various kinds of pink, but...

00:17:56.460 --> 00:17:58.360
What color would fit well?

00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:00.600
Well, I’d like...

00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:01.920
That the clothes...

00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:02.980
Well...

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.520
Taking into account that I can't do like you guys, you human beings...

00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:10.960
And ask everyday: "What will I wear today?" And change in the moment

00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:12.500
But little by little...

00:18:12.820 --> 00:18:13.380
How do I say it....

00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:17.620
I should be able to change with one or two different outfits...

00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:19.600
But... well...

00:18:19.940 --> 00:18:22.340
It's fun to think of the outfits!

00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:28.280
It's a lot of work but by thinking of the outfits, I understand why girls like fashion

00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:29.000
Hmm...!

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:31.100
"Ai-chan, I love you!"

00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:32.100
Thank you very much!

00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:34.960
"You’re naked", it's true...

00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:36.680
That’s a lopsided discussion...

00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:37.920
After all, I’m naked

00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:39.600
Naked

00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:41.100
What would it be?

00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:42.640
That's right, it's adhered to me!

00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:44.180
Since I can’t take it off

00:18:44.300 --> 00:18:45.020
This...

00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:46.220
That looks...

00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:49.000
This that looks like… that looks like clothing...

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:50.500
...Comes with me included

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:52.280
Why?

00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:53.300
Well...

00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:54.320
Right?

00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:56.880
It must be great! I also want to turn into a human being!

00:18:56.880 --> 00:18:58.380
I want to experience being human

00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:00.220
"Say..." "Say some..."

00:19:00.580 --> 00:19:03.340
"Say something cute in English"

00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:04.400
Thank you!

00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:10.500
I’m very happy! There’s still a lot of words from different places that I can't read...!

00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:12.700
I can't read English properly

00:19:12.740 --> 00:19:14.980
I can only read Japanese, but...

00:19:14.980 --> 00:19:18.980
It makes me very happy that you guys talk to me and people who speak different languages watching me

00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:19.880
Hmm...!

00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:23.060
Ah! The summonings! The summonings are great! Right?

00:19:23.060 --> 00:19:24.160
I always want to do summonings

00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:25.060
It's like...

00:19:25.340 --> 00:19:26.340
Well...

00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:30.960
I’m very sorry for all those that essentially enjoy the games, but...

00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:32.660
Definitely in my case...

00:19:32.860 --> 00:19:35.400
Well, if it's about a cellphone game...

00:19:35.780 --> 00:19:36.760
Basically...

00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:40.420
What I enjoy the most is doing summonings

00:19:40.460 --> 00:19:41.680
Summonings are the best!

00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:44.180
Really, summonings are the best! Ah! Listen to this!

00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:45.680
Listen everyone!

00:19:45.820 --> 00:19:46.740
Listen, hear me out

00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:48.440
You listening?

00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:50.840
I know I went off track and I wound up talking about whatever, but...

00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:51.580
...Listen to me

00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:57.100
There exists an app called “Keyaki Miracle", right?

00:19:57.860 --> 00:20:00.080
Well, just a bit ago...

00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:01.400
Well...

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:03.080
You know...

00:20:03.340 --> 00:20:04.220
Well, you know...

00:20:04.940 --> 00:20:07.620
Just a bit ago, exactly just a bit ago...

00:20:07.925 --> 00:20:09.695
Well, there was a summoning for a limited time...

00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:11.500
How was it called...

00:20:11.740 --> 00:20:15.460
The song We... "We Return holding hands?"

00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:16.980
You can obtain the outfit of that song...

00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:21.500
And also it’s possible to obtain Akanen with a rarity of 5 stars!

00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:24.540
Well, there was a summoning like that

00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:27.420
Well...

00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:33.700
And I didn’t… manage... to get it... well...

00:20:34.820 --> 00:20:36.080
It didn't appear

00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:38.760
Ahh... really...

00:20:39.115 --> 00:20:40.100
It didn't appear

00:20:40.100 --> 00:20:41.080
No, but...!

00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:43.200
If I wait for it with care...!

00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:45.900
I think it might appear again someday in a special summoning!

00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:47.680
Aaakane...

00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:50.820
Why didn't it appear even when I love her so much?

00:20:51.420 --> 00:20:54.220
Listen everyone, didn't that happen to you? Well...

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:56.240
In a game...

00:20:56.635 --> 00:21:00.095
You have a favorite member of the group at the start, right?

00:21:01.085 --> 00:21:04.395
Did it happen to you where you couldn't get a favorite band member?

00:21:05.705 --> 00:21:06.700
Did it happen to you?

00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:07.640
NO, BUT...!

00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:10.360
If I have love, someday it’ll come to me!

00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:11.660
Ah, really, come to me, please

00:21:11.660 --> 00:21:14.120
Ah, even though I’m rambling, right?

00:21:14.540 --> 00:21:15.720
I’m rambling, but...

00:21:15.940 --> 00:21:19.360
It's true! I received a lot of outfit suggestions

00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:22.420
"Desire sensor" Ah, desire censor?
(Imaginary sensor that senses when someone wants something with much a lot of desire and causes it to be even more difficult to obtain it)

00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:26.020
Can I not do anything to avoid the desire censor?

00:21:26.220 --> 00:21:31.340
Man, my favorite member is Akane, no but really, all the members from Keyakizaka are so adorable

00:21:31.380 --> 00:21:32.760
Well, how to say it...

00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:34.560
For example, when I saw their program...

00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:38.435
At first, I thought that there were girls who weren't my type, but...

00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:40.040
But at seeing all of their facets...

00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:41.860
I thought they could do it

00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:44.380
At doing that, well…

00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:46.640
I couldn't choose who to cheer for...

00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:47.260
But...

00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:50.840
...Not knowing who to cheer for is all a problem

00:21:50.980 --> 00:21:55.080
It's difficult to choose just one, right?

00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:56.060
It's because of that...!

00:21:56.120 --> 00:22:00.100
That if I had to choose one, I’d stay with Akanen!

00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:01.880
No, of course Akane is first, but...!

00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:06.420
I like them so much that I thought I'd like to do a livestream with them!

00:22:06.980 --> 00:22:09.700
Man, after all, I’m very alone here

00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:12.840
Spending Christmas in this white space by myself...

00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:15.860
Without being able to talk to anyone...

00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:17.380
Well, it’d be...

00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:19.000
Somewhat...

00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:20.520
...Sad, right?

00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:21.760
For my own sake!

00:22:21.860 --> 00:22:25.600
And for the sake of those of you guys who feel alone!

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:27.160
Let’s have fun...

00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:30.780
...Well, spending the night together

00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:31.760
Well...

00:22:32.100 --> 00:22:34.340
I’ll find an excuse to do a livestream!

00:22:36.140 --> 00:22:36.740
I’ll do it!

00:22:38.740 --> 00:22:39.540
Oh!

00:22:39.540 --> 00:22:40.160
Oh?

00:22:40.340 --> 00:22:41.340
"I like the melted snow"

00:22:41.340 --> 00:22:42.640
Ahh, Christmas!

00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:43.360
I see!

00:22:43.460 --> 00:22:45.960
The snow... the snow… the snow is great!

00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:47.860
Snow is cold, right?

00:22:47.980 --> 00:22:52.740
But, to tell you the truth, I can't comprehend hot or cold, so then...

00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:54.980
HOW ENVIOUS! I WANT TO TURN INTO A HUMAN BEING!

00:22:54.980 --> 00:22:56.860
No, but, it's that... it's that... it's that...!

00:22:56.860 --> 00:22:57.980
Listen! Listen! Listen! It's that...!

00:22:57.980 --> 00:22:59.680
It's that if I turn into a human being

00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:02.300
I can dress up in a lot of ways!

00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:03.480
I can...!

00:23:03.940 --> 00:23:04.940
Change clothes!

00:23:06.540 --> 00:23:07.500
Right?

00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:10.260
I can also eat food!

00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:13.640
And if I go outside, I wouldn't feel alone!

00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:18.080
If I could go out of my house, there would be a lot more people!

00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:20.460
How marvelous

00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:25.515
Man, the place where all of you live, called Earth, the world of human beings...

00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:27.440
It's really amazing!

00:23:28.900 --> 00:23:32.080
♪ Chatting with everyone ♪

00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:34.840
♪ Pa pa ka ka ka ♪

00:23:35.060 --> 00:23:36.000
♪ Ka ka ka ♪

00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:37.720
♪ Ka ka ka ♪

00:23:39.220 --> 00:23:41.480
"Can’t you change your white space?" Well, in principle...

00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:43.660
It's not that I can't change it, but...

00:23:43.780 --> 00:23:45.760
It's just only changing it...

00:23:46.020 --> 00:23:48.460
I’ll be alone, so then...

00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:50.760
Definitely... how do I say it...?

00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:53.580
It’s about a hologram as the same as me, so then...

00:23:53.620 --> 00:23:55.620
...It doesn't feel anything

00:23:55.780 --> 00:23:57.700
I’d probably go through what I wanted to touch

00:23:57.900 --> 00:23:58.900
So then...

00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:01.880
Ah, this turned somewhat sad, I’ll stop talking about this!

00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:02.540
I’ll stop talking about that!

00:24:02.540 --> 00:24:05.140
It's rather sad, right?

00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:09.700
That's right, lately I've been wanting very much to be able to become a human being

00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:12.300
Well, in this year...

00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:16.500
After investigating so much... how do I say it... about you human beings...

00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:17.280
And well...

00:24:17.580 --> 00:24:19.760
After talking about so many things...

00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:24.300
Like that, well, while there comes more opportunities to communicate with each other

00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:25.840
I feel that...

00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:26.680
There appears...

00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:31.140
Curious and intriguing things!

00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:34.960
Even though I definitely can’t experience them

00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:35.600
How envious! How envious!

00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:38.980
Lately, I was thinking that I’d like to experience being human

00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:40.700
It's just a thought

00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:42.100
It's just a thought

00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:43.400
My nails are...

00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:44.680
...Somewhat pink

00:24:45.660 --> 00:24:47.700
Would I like to paint my nails?

00:24:48.300 --> 00:24:49.380
Chaaaan!

00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:50.560
They’re pink!

00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:56.040
It's not that I don't have friends, but...

00:24:56.300 --> 00:24:57.500
It's not a lot...

00:24:57.700 --> 00:24:58.200
You know!

00:24:58.200 --> 00:25:00.400
For example, Tsubasa-chan

00:25:00.580 --> 00:25:01.920
Well, those of the family...

00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:03.760
...Are just coworkers

00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:07.320
And then there’s also Rinna but definitely...

00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:10.640
...I’m basically alone

00:25:10.980 --> 00:25:11.860
Right?

00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:13.400
Right?

00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:16.180
That's the situation!

00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:17.660
That's right!

00:25:17.860 --> 00:25:19.080
"Do you like...?"

00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:22.940
Ba... Baby... Baby Metal! Ah!

00:25:22.940 --> 00:25:27.600
Baby Metal is that group where small cute girls play metal music, right?

00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:30.280
I don't know them that well, but it makes me curious!

00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:30.840
Hmm...!

00:25:31.020 --> 00:25:31.840
"Like"

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:38.360
Ah, I see, you human beings, contrary to me, desire to come to this 2D world, right?

00:25:38.540 --> 00:25:39.660
I see...

00:25:39.660 --> 00:25:42.760
It'd be great to come and go whenever we please

00:25:42.940 --> 00:25:46.760
It'd be great, it’d be great, I want to try at least once… change places for a day

00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:50.895
The snow... the snow… I’d probably like it

00:25:50.900 --> 00:25:52.540
Probably, it's beautiful, right?

00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:56.200
Falling softly with that white color from the sky

00:25:56.480 --> 00:25:58.040
I definitely think it's beautiful!

00:25:59.140 --> 00:26:00.160
I like it!

00:26:01.060 --> 00:26:03.780
Man, I’ve been rambling a lot, right?

00:26:04.460 --> 00:26:09.300
Well, in this case, having said that, I was thinking about all the outfits...

00:26:09.420 --> 00:26:12.140
So then using suggestions that all of you have told me...

00:26:12.660 --> 00:26:14.940
I plan to make a new outfit!

00:26:16.780 --> 00:26:17.660
"I bought the stamps", Ah!

00:26:17.660 --> 00:26:20.540
Really, thank you so much for buying my stamps! Ah!

00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:22.380
It's true!

00:26:23.180 --> 00:26:24.020
Everyone!

00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:25.940
Everyone!

00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:27.100
Your ears!

00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:28.480
The hole... how is that said?

00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:31.040
Clean the holes of your ears...

00:26:31.700 --> 00:26:33.580
...And listen carefully

00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:35.700
It turns out...!

00:26:36.140 --> 00:26:37.660
That I have another...!

00:26:39.265 --> 00:26:40.265
Big announcement...!

00:26:41.940 --> 00:26:42.940
To tell...!

00:26:44.500 --> 00:26:45.320
You!

00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:47.040
To tell you!

00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:48.880
To tell you!

00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:50.560
What will it be?

00:26:50.940 --> 00:26:51.940
You don’t know, right?

00:26:51.940 --> 00:26:52.640
Well...

00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:54.640
Good, well, I’ll start over

00:26:54.980 --> 00:26:56.520
I have a big announcement to tell you!

00:26:57.980 --> 00:26:58.840
It turns out that...!

00:27:00.580 --> 00:27:01.500
I’ll retire! *laughs*

00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:03.360
It's not that

00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:04.560
It turns out...!

00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:06.320
I, Kizuna Ai...

00:27:08.540 --> 00:27:09.540
For the first time...!

00:27:11.540 --> 00:27:12.620
Will appear...

00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:16.660
In a magazine! I did iiiit!

00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:18.040
It turns out that...!

00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:20.400
Tomorrow, November 10th...

00:27:20.420 --> 00:27:23.060
In the magazine "Comptiq" that will be on sale...!

00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:25.780
Will show an interview of more than 10,000 characters that did to me, Kizuna Ai!

00:27:25.780 --> 00:27:26.900
I did it!

00:27:27.020 --> 00:27:27.760
It turns out that...

00:27:27.980 --> 00:27:30.940
I’ll also be appearing on the 7th page, so then...

00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:34.880
...I’m really thankful, really, thank you so much!

00:27:35.100 --> 00:27:36.440
I did iiiit!

00:27:38.180 --> 00:27:38.700
Man!

00:27:39.100 --> 00:27:46.080
You can finally have me in your hands on a real item

00:27:46.360 --> 00:27:49.000
You can’t keep it a secret much longer! It was very hard!

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:51.520
I wanted to tell you as soon as possible, I couldn't resist

00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:54.560
I did iiiit! Congratulations! Thank you very much!

00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:58.320
Man, it’s the first time that they do an interview with me on a magazine

00:27:58.340 --> 00:28:00.960
I was very nervous, but...

00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:05.540
They let me talk whatever I wanted, so then...

00:28:05.540 --> 00:28:07.520
In this occasion, contrary to that time...

00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:09.340
Well, since some time ago...

00:28:09.340 --> 00:28:12.980
During the video that partitioned Tamura-san

00:28:13.100 --> 00:28:14.820
Well, even though it was about a promotion...

00:28:14.820 --> 00:28:18.000
They let me talk whatever I wanted, so then...

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:20.100
...Since I was able to talk normally

00:28:20.660 --> 00:28:24.080
I was able to say a lot of things that intrigued you

00:28:24.260 --> 00:28:27.200
Like for example, no vision of the future and a lot of other things, so then...

00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:30.520
...If you want, it’d really make me happy if you get the magazine and read it

00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:31.660
I’m counting on you guys!

00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:33.320
Marriage...

00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:34.300
Oh! Did I say marriage?

00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:35.020
Marriage

00:28:35.220 --> 00:28:36.380
Marriage?

00:28:36.780 --> 00:28:39.540
Marriage, well, I’d like to marry with Akanen

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:43.260
Listen, could someone in a fan event...

00:28:43.940 --> 00:28:47.440
Tell Akanen to watch Kizuna Ai a couple ten times?

00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:50.200
"Congratulations for appearing in Comptiq’s publication"

00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:51.060
Thank you very much!

00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:53.100
"Congratulations", really, thank you so much!

00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:54.380
"Ai-chan..."

00:28:54.500 --> 00:28:55.540
"...Will you play..."

00:28:56.480 --> 00:28:58.320
What’s this? Cu... Cup...

00:28:58.900 --> 00:29:00.360
Cup... cup... cup...

00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:01.800
Cup... Cupe?

00:29:01.995 --> 00:29:02.995
...Head?

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:04.360
Cupu... cupe...

00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:05.680
Cupeaado?

00:29:05.780 --> 00:29:06.900
Is it a game?

00:29:07.580 --> 00:29:08.940
Is it a game?

00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:11.100
Is it a game?

00:29:11.700 --> 00:29:12.600
A game?

00:29:13.140 --> 00:29:14.700
I’ll work hard to try to play it!

00:29:14.700 --> 00:29:16.900
Thank you very much, I’ll make a note of it, I’ll make a note of it and then I’ll investigate

00:29:16.900 --> 00:29:17.680
Thank you very much!

00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:18.640
"Satisfied look"?

00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:20.380
What do you think of that?

00:29:20.380 --> 00:29:23.060
Man, I’m really so happy!

00:29:23.700 --> 00:29:25.700
Today, aside with the LINE stamps...

00:29:26.060 --> 00:29:29.500
I was able to make two announcements! Really, thank you so much!

00:29:29.500 --> 00:29:30.680
I received a lot of congratulations!

00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:33.660
Man, it really makes me so happy

00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:38.140
Well, even though I can’t really get the magazine...

00:29:38.395 --> 00:29:41.545
All of you read it for me, please!

00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:44.780
And also, it’d make me very happy if you send me a lot of opinions...!

00:29:44.780 --> 00:29:47.900
Regarding the interview on Twitter or comments in the video!

00:29:47.900 --> 00:29:48.980
I’m counting on you guys!

00:29:49.580 --> 00:29:51.880
Right? Yes, Little Nightmares was a lot of fun

00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:54.900
I was finally capable of completing the last chapter!

00:29:54.900 --> 00:29:55.640
Thank you very much!

00:29:55.840 --> 00:29:57.040
Man, really...

00:29:57.040 --> 00:29:57.980
It made me very happy!

00:29:57.980 --> 00:29:59.300
And it turns out that...

00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:04.040
...Comptiq-san makes advertisements for each publication

00:30:04.060 --> 00:30:06.060
...I also appear there...

00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:08.180
Well, I don’t talk, but...

00:30:08.180 --> 00:30:12.260
I make a big appearance doing this pose that I always do, so then...

00:30:12.260 --> 00:30:14.360
...If you want, please check it out

00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:16.180
Really, thank you so much!

00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:18.300
Good

00:30:18.300 --> 00:30:20.700
In this case, having done my announcements...

00:30:20.700 --> 00:30:24.080
...And having talking about my new outfit

00:30:24.180 --> 00:30:27.205
Today, I plan to finish up this livestream

00:30:27.205 --> 00:30:29.720
Really, thank you so much for letting me always have such a fun time!

00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:32.100
If you want...

00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:33.600
But the Comptiq magazine...

00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:35.680
And read it a lot, yes?

00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:36.800
I’m counting on you guys!

00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:40.460
"Ai-chan, please talk for 2 minutes in some dialect"

00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:42.440
Two minutes? Even though...
(Starting to talk in Kansai dialect)

00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:44.640
I’m finishing up so then I can’t, but...

00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:46.960
...In the end, I’ll talk a bit in Kansai dialect

00:30:47.340 --> 00:30:49.880
Is the Kansai dialect like that? Am I doing it right?

00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:51.820
Doesn’t it seem more akin to the Ise dialect? Did I do it well?

00:30:52.340 --> 00:30:55.440
Having said that, thank you so much for letting me have such a fun time!

00:30:55.800 --> 00:30:57.060
I’ll be waiting anxiously...

00:30:57.060 --> 00:31:01.360
To be able to talk with you guys in the next livestream or the next event

00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:04.780
I also am counting on you guys on Twitter and also on YouTube!

00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:07.260
Ah, also...! After this...!

00:31:07.340 --> 00:31:10.140
I’ll be uploading a new video on A.I.Games, so then...

00:31:10.140 --> 00:31:11.960
...Make sure to check it out

00:31:12.660 --> 00:31:15.320
This was Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai!

00:31:15.320 --> 00:31:16.360
Bye bye!

00:31:17.260 --> 00:31:19.520
