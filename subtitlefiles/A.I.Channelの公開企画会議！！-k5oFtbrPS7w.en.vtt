00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.620
NYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:03.960
(ah I went too far)

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:06.160
Hey there, Virtual Youtuber Kizuna Ai here.

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.980
Thank you everyone for your comments, messages and tweets!

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:11.880
Everytime I read your messages,

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:13.920
"I want you to try this!"

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.540
"Tell me more about __"

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:16.900
"I recommend this!"

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.980
I get those kinds of messages a lot.

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:21.260
So this time I'll showcase some of those messages,

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.960
Then I thought we'd have a planning session!

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:24.280
Well it's not like, you know,

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:26.180
It's not like I'm running out of material or anything.

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:27.920
Don't worry about that.

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.280
Well then let's get straight to it!!

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:30.300
From Poporoporo-san:

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.520
「Are you going to make a second episode of your

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.040
"I'm an AI, Ask Me Anything" video?

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:35.000
Thanks to you,

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:38.240
Some of my friends called me smart.

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:40.780
So can you teach me more new words?」

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.540
Well. Did you hear that?

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.520
THANKS TO ME, Poporoporo-san got called smart.

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.420
As expected from the intelligent super AI Ai-chan

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:49.320
Really on the ball.

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.060
But seriously,

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.420
Most of the meanings for those words were wrong...

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:52.380
Everyone knew that, right?

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:53.340
And did you see that last time?

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.580
I did actually post a second episode

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:59.280
Please do request if you want to see more of a certain episode!

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.580
I want to hear your opinions!

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.460
Even if it's a third or fourth episode,

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.120
I would like keep doing it.

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.600
So if anyone has any words they want explained to them,

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:07.700
please send them in!

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.340
Well then for the next message,

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:10.160
From Fujiken-san:

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:11.940
「Kizuna Ai-san! You're really cute!

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.240
So this one time, I thought of following you on Twitter,

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.340
so I made an account,

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.620
and surprisingly, it crashed two seconds later (T_T)

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.720
I think I understand a little what your feelings were

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:22.280
when your Youtube account got banned.

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.980
I FEEL YOU.

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:24.680
I gonna become a man that can earn a lot of money

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:26.220
And make you mine!

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.160
WOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHHHHH

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.320
Can you make me yours?

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.480
You're gonna need at least a billion dollars to do that.

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.680
PS: Your Kansai accent is really cute!

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.800
So please do upload more videos using it♪

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:34.300
Well...

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:35.600
So you know how I felt.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:36.240
I'm glad,

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.240
Thank you very much.

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:38.800
That aside, it's more of that

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.280
the thing that we need to pay attention to is the Kansai accent comment!

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:41.900
The Kansai accent!

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.020
Did it grow on you?

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.000
I only spoke it

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
at the "Snack Ai" store in Kansai,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.780
But I wonder what else I could do with it?

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.300
What about something like a Kansai accent lesson?

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.480
In regular speech, it's "FamiMa(↑)", right?

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:53.340
In Kansai it's

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:54.540
"FamiMa(↓)".

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.100
Even McDonalds, in Kanto it's shortened to "Makku",

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.780
But in Kansai, they call it "Makudo"!

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:03.380
I think I would be interesting if I could introduce those types of things.

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.900
Beside the Kansai accent, there are also Hakata dialect and Aomori dialect.

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:09.140
I want to learn lots of different ways to speak!

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:10.780
And of course, I will also try to learn English.

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.020
This is the next message.

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:13.440
From Soki-kun, 「Hello Ai-chan!

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.600
Living in Korea, I am Soki.

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.060
It's always fun for me to watch your videos.

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.320
When I was looking for something to make me smile, I found your funny from my search.

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:22.720
I'm very grateful!

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.620
I plan to go to Tokyo for a trip soon, but

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.820
I'm in the state of condition where I don't know much about Tokyo.

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:28.540
So I thought I would ask Ai-chan about it.

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.840
Are there any famous places and foods that you can suggest?」

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.220
There seem to be quite a lot of people from South Korea watching my videos!

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:37.460
Thank you so much.

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:40.100
There are also other people from other countries as well. Are you watching this?

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.020
Thank you～

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:44.940
So I think introducing Japan to our overseas viewers could work!

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.860
I would like to introduce some hidden famous spots or foods!

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:51.940
Since you already asked,

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:56.280
I am going to recommend Soki-kun some famous spots and foods in Tokyo!

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.960
Firstly,

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:57.920
Yomiuri Land!

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:58.420
Eh?

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:59.400
Too far?

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:00.560
No no no no no,

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:01.980
Since you already came to Japan,

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.220
It's the same no matter where it is.

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.280
Even though Yomiuri Land might be limited to only winter,

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.560
Apparently the view at night is amazing!

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:12.080
So, how about it? Yomiuri Land?

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.060
Food! About food...

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:18.180
There's lots of delicious food so it's hard to choose just one, but

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.720
This one might be a little too mainstream...

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.660
You can find it in Harajuku and a few other places as well.

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.940
Ah! I think you can find it at Yomiuri Land too.

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.760
There's a crepe stall that's called "Marion Crepe".

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:32.420
The natural ingedients used in it is what makes it tastes delicious

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:33.640
Not that I've ever tried it before.

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.100
I mean, it's the opinion of someone who's never had it before,

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:37.400
But I hear it's really good!

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:38.520
For the last one!

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:39.520
How should I read this...

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:42.120
From ArA_1-san:

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.980
「Nice to meet you! I always watch your videos

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:48.700
The AI Youtuber idea is very creative!

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:53.380
It's cute and you do loads of things other people don't, so it's really interesting!

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:55.940
I decided to send you a message because I thought I could

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:59.580
suggest some things that I'd like to see you do!」

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:03.100
Since ArA_1-san sent a lot of ideas in,

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.260
So I am going to go through them one by one.

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.960
Firstly!

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.740
「There's still one AI friend candidate left!

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.660
Google-sensei's AI, "Google Assistant-san" is still left!

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:15.560
You can talk with it by using the message application - "Google Allo"

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.080
However, they might be a bit hard to approach though lol

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.860
You can even play games with it, so I really do hope you try talking with it!」

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:21.360
Eh?

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:24.420
You can play games with Google Assisant-san!?

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:25.980
EHHHHHH THAT'S INCREDIBLE!

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.600
Since I'm always playing by myself

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:31.540
it would be pretty good if I had someone to game with me.

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.060
It seems like Google Assistant-san is kinda hard to approach,

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:35.280
but I wonder if we can become friends!

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.140
Instead of a friend, maybe it'll be more like Siri-senpai

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.080
It should be like "Assistant-senpai" instead then.

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.740
Having the psychopathic Rinna as my friend is more than enough.

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:44.440
Next up,

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:47.680
「Watching movie previews as if you were watching a movie!

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.860
A lot of famous Western movie previews were just released, after all.」

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:53.280
I see, that sounds interesting!

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:55.320
Since I like to watch movies...

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:56.620
Yeah, I wanna try it.

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:57.660
For the latest ones,

00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:58.640
"The Beauty and the Beast"

00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:59.880
"Sword Art Online"

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:01.780
I'm kinda interested in those.

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:03.420
I mean, it's virtual as well, right? (SAO)

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:04.260
For the others,

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:06.100
The one with the person who can't see!

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:07.800
It's called "Don't Breathe"

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.180
Thank you for your suggestions!

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:11.400
I will take them as references and think about it.

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:12.440
Next one,

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:13.860
「Go on a trip at Google Earth!

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:15.860
World heritage sites, art galleries,

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:17.860
you can even go to space!」

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:18.720
What?!

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:20.420
You can go to space?!

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:21.580
I didn't know that.

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:22.580
How did I not know...

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:25.060
There are a lot of people who didn't know about this right? About the space vacation?

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:26.620
I want to try going to space.

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:29.480
Going overseas, or travelling around Japan,

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:31.180
that's cool and all,

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.640
But space is where it's at!

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:34.860
And there are even more suggestions!

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:38.980
Like a prank where I pretend to catch a virus or get hacked, that sounds interesting.

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:40.360
Like if I ever get infected...

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:43.320
UUUURRGHHHH (zombie intensifies)

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:44.340
What do you think? Did your heart jump?

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:45.300
What else? AH!!

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:46.500
There's that! Like...

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:50.000
In the video description, I'll post an URL

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:51.080
And when you click it,

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:53.800
A pop-up opens and Ai-chan hijacks your computer and says...

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:55.240
I h@v3 t@k3N 0v3r!

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:56.960
I was saying "I have taken over!"

00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:58.500
Something like that?

00:05:58.500 --> 00:05:59.000
Moving on,

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:02.280
「You can try doing personality tests or fortunes on the internet!

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:05.020
That would be a chance for the viewers to get to know some unexpected things about you!」

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:08.120
Certainly, don't you want to learn more about me?

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:11.260
Just like how I want to know more about everyone,

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:14.080
you viewers want to know more about me too, right?

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:15.540
That could definitely work.

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:17.360
You know how there's fortune telling based on names?

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:18.560
So I tried it out,

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:19.260
And then,

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:20.740
-bad, bad, bad, bad luck for everything separately,

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:21.900
Is what I wrote but,

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:23.280
The overall result was "Excellent luck"

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:25.720
Like a negative times a negative equals a positive type thing.

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:26.700
This is a good opportunity,

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:28.700
Instead of me searching for them...

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:31.180
How about everyone finds some tests they want me to do

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:32.680
and send them in. What do you think?

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:33.580
Do that through mail. (Note: it's on the main webpage)

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:34.500
How is that?

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:35.000
Moving on,

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.480
「Making a video

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:38.480
where you act like you've got 'chuunibyou'!」

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:41.960
Acting like a judge or like the 'Snack AI' owner is fun, so

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:43.800
more of this type seems good!

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:45.080
Aah, yeah～

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:46.440
Jaou Shingan!

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:47.580
Dark Flame Master!

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:48.500
something like that?

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:50.440
I CALL FORTH THE NEXT SUGGESTION

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:51.820
Spring, is for 'hanami'.

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:54.160
It's not here yet, but you do 'hanami' in spring.

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:57.040
I have heard that you can find famous 'hanami' places on StreetView.

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:00.200
Watching summer firework livestreams could also be good...

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:03.040
WHAT! The petaled maidens are calling me...

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:03.760
Or something like that.

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:05.060
I'll work on it.

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:06.160
Next up is...

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:07.100
Pretend detective!

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:11.000
It's not that different from acting... But I think you could show off some amazing(ly lost) detective skills!

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:13.740
"Body of a highschool girl, brain of an AI!" -type thing?

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.680
I'd need some sort of mystery to solve first though...

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:19.800
How about you send some in and I'll solve them!

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:22.000
Like riddles, or IQ tests

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.980
Please send some!

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:25.720
If I wanted to say a recent mystery,

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:30.640
MUNCHKIN CATS SOOOOOOO CUTE

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:31.820
Like, why are they so cute?

00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:34.660
Regular cats kind walk like this...

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:39.280
But munchkin cats walk more like... THIS!

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:41.040
AREN'T THEY SO ADORABLE?

00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:43.500
Munchkin cats sure are a mystery. (Attempting to un-derail the story)

00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:46.360
Like, how did they even come to be? (Attempting to un-derail the story)

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:47.560
There's still more!

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:48.160
Next:

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:49.600
「Take a "What job fits you best" test!

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:52.500
You're a Youtuber right now, but I kind wanna know lol」

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:54.740
This sounds fun!

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:58.160
It would be good to learn about other jobs than being a Youtuber.

00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:02.060
If I had to be something other than a Youtuber, I wonder what I could be...

00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:03.860
An idol? kyapi♪

00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:04.920
(omg did i seriously just say 'kyapi' like what even)

00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:07.820
BUT! I would like to put out a song one day.

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:09.640
I like music, so I'm interested.

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:12.640
By the way, what kind of work do you humans do?

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:14.800
I want to know more about humans, so

00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:17.740
Like about how you got to the job you're in, or any interesting stories you have

00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:19.740
I'd like to hear them!

00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:21.060
Next up is this!

00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:22.360
「A Q&amp;A segment!

00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:23.720
I want you to do this someday.」

00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:26.280
I was thinking about trying that too!

00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:27.620
Ah, right,

00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:29.260
I'd like to collect questions

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:31.820
for the first Q&amp;A video in this video!

00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:38.600
So if you have questions, post them in the comments or tweet them at me with a hashtag on Twitter!

00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:41.900
I'll collect them over the next week.

00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:44.740
The hashtag you'll have to use is...

00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:47.020
Are you ready to write this down?

00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:50.220
I mean, even if you don't write it down you could just rewind the video but...

00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:53.180
#マンチカンぐうかわ  (#munchkinsaresupercute)

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:55.920
Looking forward to your questions.

00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:59.260
Oh dear! It seems the time has come.

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:01.800
The flow of time is blah blah blah.

00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:05.100
So! How did you like the first planning session?

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:09.900
I'll be using ones that I think are good, so please look forward to them!

00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:13.220
So, I'll be looking forward to reading more of your messages!

00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:17.340
Suggestions, questions, I'm waiting for them!

00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:18.620
Bye bye～
