00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:01.320
Hey everyone.

00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:02.920
So we've been wanting to make a video about this topic

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:03.980
for quite a while.

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:05.340
The infamous "DTR".

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:07.340
Yeah, so huge thanks to Google Home,

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:09.440
and Google Play Music for making video possible.

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:11.880
Be sure to stay tuned to the end, to find out

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.200
How you can meet us in L.A this weekend.

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:14.500
Hope you enjoy!

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:27.120
Happy valentines day to me!

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:28.600
You're so lame.

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.020
I've got to go make some plans. Okay...

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.060
Can you please wash your dishes T.J!

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:41.160
I have someone coming over,

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.400
and I need our place to be clean.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:43.420
Do you really need to clean

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.500
For your single ladies wine and whine night?

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.040
Not them! It's um...Jeffery.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:50.420
Jeffery?

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.900
Whoa! On Valentines day?

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.360
Are you guys each others dates?

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.740
We both didn't have plans, so we're just hanging out.

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:00.400
You guys have been hanging out for a couple of months now.

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.280
It's clear what's going on.

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.140
You guys need to "DTR."

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:04.620
"DTR?"

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:06.240
Define the relationship.

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.940
We're not in a relationship.

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.780
Okay, Google. Define relationship.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.740
Relationship is the way in which two or more concepts, objects or people

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.140
are connected, or the state of being connected.

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.280
Okay, Google. What about boyfriend?

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.420
Boyfriend. A regular male companion with whom one has a romantic relationship.

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.800
I wish.

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:29.980
Come over here!

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.900
Don't you wanna get out of this weird grey area with him?

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:41.200
Yes. But he still hasn't said if he has feelings yet.

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.680
Ohhhh...maybe...

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:46.900
You could tell him first.

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:49.140
No.

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:49.980
Why not?

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:50.820
Because I'm scared.

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.480
How do you think guys feel? We do it all the time.

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:54.000
We have to put up with so much too.

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:55.420
Let's call it even.

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:56.140
It's 2017.

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:58.080
Gender roles are out the window.

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.920
Tacho shells are made of chicken.

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.400
I can talk to my electronics!

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:07.000
Okay, Google. Play some music for chillin' with friends on my TV.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.680
All right. Here's a Google Play Music station called "Chillin' the Beats" on your TV.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.360
We're in the future!

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.680
Well, here in the future

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.160
it's still hard to tell someone "I like you"

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.440
especially someone like Jeffery who's such a close friend.

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.180
What are you so afraid of?

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.560
Umm I don't know. That he won't like me back

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.260
That I'll be devastated with embarrassment

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.300
That I'll become a recluse with regret

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.760
That my long lasting friendship has now devolved into awkward side hugs and small talk about traffic.

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.040
Riggggghhht.

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.380
Okay, let me ask you something.

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.220
Remember that one guy last year with the socks?

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:51.560
Yeah, he called you everyday and texted you every time he saw something that reminded him of you.

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.720
You were so sure that he liked you.

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:55.760
Yeah, so annoying.

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.880
That's exactly what Jeffrey's been doing!

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.620
How come you're not sure this time?

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.780
Because!

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.200
Because when I like them

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.800
I just...I doubt myself.

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:10.080
Helps protect my feelings.

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:12.180
Look, I get it.

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.960
As a guy,

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:15.340
I've told many girls that I've liked them.

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:16.760
Do you want a medal or something?

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.600
And yeah, it sucks to feel rejected

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.300
but it is a great feeling when you can be honest with yourself.

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:28.520
But doesn't it still come off too forward if a girl makes the first move?

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:30.760
You know, if a girl tells a girl she likes him,

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:33.900
people think she's desperate.

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.560
Jen!

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:36.300
Yes.

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:37.200
You're a girl right?

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.940
Yes.

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:39.560
Have you ever told a guy you liked him before?

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:40.940
Yeah, and I do it all the time.

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:42.940
And are you ever worried about coming off as desperate?

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:44.700
Nooo.

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.860
It's not like I'm DM-ing my entire feed.

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:49.860
Except for right now to get away from you.

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:52.760
Here's the thing.

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:55.500
When it comes to dating

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.860
I don't wanna play games. I just don't have time for any of that.

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.280
Fine, you're so experienced.

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:03.940
But how do you do it?

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:06.960
Well, how do you want someone to tell you?

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:12.020
I want them to be respectful and not too forceful.

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:17.540
And honest enough so that everything's off their chest.

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:20.140
Just like that.

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:21.640
That's how you do it.

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:23.660
Oh crap! That's him.

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:25.720
You got this. Come on! Go!

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:30.260
Okay, Google. Play something romantic.

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:35.160
Sure. Here's a Google Play Music Station called "The Indie Crush Mixtape."

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:40.240
Go, go!

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:43.840
Hey! Hey!

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:45.280
Dude...hahaha

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.340
Ready to celebrate Single Awareness Day?

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:49.360
Yeah, I got all the worst movies queued up.

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.340
Hey Jeffrey! I didn't know you were coming.

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:52.580
Just missed ya. Bye!

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:54.040
Hi Jeff!

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:54.880
Hi!

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:55.900
Bye Jeff!

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:57.520
Oh...Umm..Okay...

00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:58.760
See ya!

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.720
So, should I start making the popcorn?

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:05.460
Actually, let's just chat first.

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:07.700
Feel like we haven't caught up in a while.

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:09.200
I just saw you this Tuesday.

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:10.120
Just sit.

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:15.400
I'm sorry, I just...I need to tell you something.

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:16.320
Okay sure sure.

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:18.220
Whoo..okay

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:19.800
I'm just...I'm thinking about it too much.

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.000
I'm just gonna say it.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.100
What's going on?

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:25.720
We've been friends for awhile now

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:28.280
and I mean, we're hanging out a lot.

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:31.180
You call me, like, every other day.

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:35.120
And you text me every time you see something that reminds you of me.

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:38.080
and never talk about other girls around me.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.120
If you were any other guy, I would totally know that you had feelings for me.

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:47.880
But, it's you, so I'm not so sure.

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.180
Because I'm doubting myself

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:52.160
That's because

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:53.320
it's because

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:55.760
I like you.

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:02.360
Ha..haha

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:03.280
Why are you laughing?

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:05.300
Sorry! I'm not laughing at you.

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:06.600
It's just like...

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:09.560
You know how an emotion can sometimes take over your physical functions?

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:10.440
What are you saying Jeff?

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:11.700
No. I like you too!

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:15.100
I like you too.

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:17.700
I've been wanting to tell you for a while now but

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:19.540
I was nervous because

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:21.880
I didn't want to risk ruining our friendship.

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:26.620
Okay then...

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:28.000
Okay.

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:32.160
So, I guess we defined the relationship.

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:34.200
Yes we did.

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:38.720
Now what?

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:47.000
Oh! I thought you wanted this.

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:48.320
Okay...

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:49.440
Have fun!

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:55.420
Nice....He's hot!

00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:56.940
Jen!

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:01.220
I'm so sorry.

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:04.100
What are you saying Jeff?

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:05.860
No..no..I like you too.

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:07.420
I love you too.
