00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.200
Hmm... do you have energy?

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:06.060
If you have the energy, you can do whatever you want

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:07.600
You’re an idiot!

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:08.660
Hello everyone!

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.660
Hot blooded Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai here!

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.880
Today, I’ll be transmitting my passionate feelings in a passionate way!

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:21.100
You, who locked yourself in the house because lately it's been cold!

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:22.920
That’s not good! Not good! Not good!
That's not good!

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.060
If you plan to give up over such an insignificant matter!

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.480
Remember that I, being in this white space completely alone...

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.100
...I record videos on my own!

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:31.280
But don’t worry!

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.180
I’m with all of you who are watching me

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.200
That's why no matter how lonely you feel!

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:37.880
You’ll feel a warmth in your heart!!

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.660
That’s right, at this moment, I’m a virtual hokkairo!
(Type of thermal cloth to warm the body)

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.740
I’ll make sure to encourage you with this heat!

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.820
Choose your goal, work toward the end and you’ll definitely make it

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:50.900
That’s right

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:51.880
It's because of that...

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.260
Never give up!!

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:55.540
All of you!

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.200
Have you taken something seriously and worked hard for it lately?

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.300
If you take things seriously, you can change the world!

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:02.620
If you take things seriously, you can change everything!

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:03.720
Wait, wait a moment

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:06.180
Why? Why do you get so negative?

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.560
To believe in yourself, you write "Jishin"

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.920
You need to have more confidence in yourselves and work hard!

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.840
Don’t worry

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.120
I'm seeing how you guys are working hard!

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:15.020
I'm encouraging you!

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.260
You can do it! Don’t worry!

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:17.180
You can do it! You can do it!

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.820
You can definitely do it!

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:20.360
It's only a matter of feeling that you want to do it

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.900
That’s right! Don't give up with your feelings!

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:23.980
You should work hard being certain and positive!

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.860
Even the "Random Word Generator" is working hard!

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.620
It's true that you can get depressed when something fails, right?

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.840
"Why did that happen?"

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.460
"Why did I say that?"

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.860
I tend to ask the same thing myself so I understand you completely!

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:41.120
But don't worry!

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.100
Another wind will blow tomorrow!

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:44.100
What happens, happens!

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.600
Don’t worry...

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:46.640
...Be happy

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.020
“I feel cold in my heart and body"

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.860
For those that think that!

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.360
There exists a method which you can feel warmth immediately!

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:54.300
This method is...

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:55.220
Using your words!

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:57.500
If you say you're cold, you'll feel even colder

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.520
It's because of that that if you say you feel warm,  you'll feel even warmer!

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:01.440
Do you understand?

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:02.780
That's right

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:04.100
It's because of that, that...

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:05.080
It's hot!

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:06.180
It's hot!

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.560
It's hot! It's hot! It's hot!

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:14.980
It's hot! It's hot! It's hot! It's hot! It's hot! It's hot! It's hot! It's hot! It's hot! It's hot!

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.980
