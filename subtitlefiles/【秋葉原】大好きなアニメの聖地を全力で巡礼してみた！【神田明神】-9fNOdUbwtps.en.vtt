00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.200
Hello everyone!

00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:06.060
Today, I’d like to go on a pilgrimage to a sacred place of one of my favorite animes with Google Maps!

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:06.920
Yes! Bam~

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:07.980
First off is here!

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:09.060
"Myoujin Otokozaka"!

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:10.120
Do you know it?

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:12.660
There are probably people who already go *ping*

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:13.620
That's it...

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.260
These are the stairs where everyone was doing their best and practicing!

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:17.700
IT'S YELLOW!
(Hoshizora Rin's Call from LoveLive's concerts)

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:18.840
Next is here!

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.300
For those who don't know where this is, that's very bad

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.880
You already know it, right?

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.380
It is the shrine where Non-tan worked at 
*Kanda Myojin*

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:28.540
THANK YOU VERY MUCH!
(Toujou Nozomi's Call from LoveLive's concerts)

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:30.600
A lot of characters showed up, right?

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.320
Like saying: Stop the rain!

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:33.380
Can I go for a shrine visit?

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:34.420
Oh! Oh! Oh!

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:35.440
Can I get up to here?

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:36.780
Ah, good day mister

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:37.660
Let's start... very good

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:38.180
*Whoosh*

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:41.800
WAIT A MINUTE!
(Koizumi Hanayo's Call from LoveLive's concerts)

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:42.420
Good!

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:43.640
Next is... over here!

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:44.180
Yes!

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:45.660
Maybe you already know it?

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.460
This is a place called Takemura, but...

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:49.960
This is the place where Honoka-chan’s parents used to live...

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.000
This is the original design of the "Homura" store, right?

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.880
FIGHT!
(Kousaka Honoka's Call from LoveLive's concerts)

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:54.880
Did you know that...

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:56.560
After the anime became popular...

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.600
It seemed like a lot of customers came here

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:00.220
That anime is...

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:01.180
LoveLive!

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.540
Of course you got that correct, right?

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:05.000
The quiz is over now, but...

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.500
Since we are already doing this...

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.620
I’d like to go around these places!

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:11.000
Okay, here, everyone, can you recognize it?

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.520
Yume no Oohashi! 
(The Bridge of Dreams)

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.080
This is the sacred place of...

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.120
“Natsuiro Egao de 1, 2, Jump!”

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.200
This is the place where they are singing in the PV

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.640
♪ Natsuiro Egao de 1, 2, Jump ♪

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.000
NICO NICO NII~!
(Yazawa Nico's Call from LoveLive's concerts)

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.100
It's the song with Nico-chan as the main vocalist

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.680
And following up, this one!

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.960
This one is... on first sight, it’s hard to make out, but...

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.700
This is the stage where of opening of the first season: "Bokura wa ima no naka de", the "Last Live"
*Harumi passenger ship terminal*

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:37.500
It's great, right?

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.260
When I think about them all dancing here...

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:41.080
It warms up your heart, right?

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.180
ELICHIKA!
(Ayase Eli's Call from LoveLive's concerts)

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.920
Also...

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.320
When I look at it my heart also warms up a lot!

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:48.480
Hey, look at this!

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.980
They look alike

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:50.460
They really look alike, they look alike!

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.300
This place is the model of "Snow Halation"!
*Gyokou Avenue*

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.800
A divine song

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.080
That was great, right? There was an actual live performance

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.740
Everyone was enjoying Honoka-chan's "Todokete" singing "To reach you"...

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.820
It was all white and shiny...

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:03.420
... And there were orange fireworks going: "Bababababa!"

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.120
That was really beautiful! Right?

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.600
KAKIKUKEKOOOO!
(Maki Nishikino's Call from LoveLive's concerts)

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.500
The lighting was orange too! it was great, wasn’t it?

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:11.620
It was the best!

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.080
CHUN CHUUUUN!
(Minami Kotori's Call from LoveLive's concerts)

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.720
What is this place? Cha-chan!

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.380
You can recognize this place, right?

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:18.360
The answer is...

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:19.600
UDX!
*Akihabara UDX*

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:26.540
This is the school called "UTX" in LoveLive, where all the members of A-Rise assist!

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:27.920
Take a look, please!

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.000
Aren't they broadcasting LoveLive Sunshine on that screen?

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.360
They sure know!

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.760
This is an important place, you know. At the beginning of LoveLive’s anime...

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.620
...Honoka-chan and Nico-chan are watching the screen together, where they can see A-Rise showing up...

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.080
...And both say that they were inspired by them...

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.400
We can also see it in Love Live Sunshine, right?

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.900
UUGH!
(Sonoda Umi's Call from LoveLive's concerts)

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.060
With that being said, my pilgrimage across all of LoveLive's sacred places is now over!

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.820
Yaaaaay!

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:50.600
How was it?

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.140
It was great, wasn't it?

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.900
I was able to virtually visit all of those places...

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.040
It makes me really happy

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.360
With that being said, if you ever come to Japan...

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:01.340
... If you ever come to Tokyo...

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.460
... Make sure to visit all of those places, ok?

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:04.800
See you later!
