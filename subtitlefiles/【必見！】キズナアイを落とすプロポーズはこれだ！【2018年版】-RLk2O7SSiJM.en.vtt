Hello everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna AI here!

00:00:02.868 --> 00:00:05.222
Wow~, I can’t believe it’s already June!

00:00:05.222 --> 00:00:05.922
Time sure flies!

00:00:05.922 --> 00:00:07.701
We’re already halfway through the year

00:00:07.791 --> 00:00:09.693
Now, what’s in June…

00:00:09.758 --> 00:00:10.282
Ahh!

00:00:10.293 --> 00:00:12.362
My birthday!

00:00:12.362 --> 00:00:13.864
Not really

00:00:13.864 --> 00:00:15.999
It’s the 30th of June!

00:00:15.999 --> 00:00:17.701
Not really~

00:00:17.701 --> 00:00:18.969
It’s marriage season!

00:00:18.969 --> 00:00:20.170
Like for June Brides?

00:00:20.232 --> 00:00:21.495
I’m sure that even

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:22.139
Some of you Kizuners

00:00:22.139 --> 00:00:23.673
Are preparing your own

00:00:23.673 --> 00:00:24.740
Marriage proposals!

00:00:24.741 --> 00:00:25.976
Congratulations~!

00:00:32.249 --> 00:00:33.283
I mean, not!

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:34.060
Huh?

00:00:34.152 --> 00:00:34.652
Oh

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:35.485
Yeah, yeah

00:00:35.485 --> 00:00:37.164
Ahh, really?

00:00:37.348 --> 00:00:38.350
That’d be right~

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:40.957
You’re wondering how you can get married to me?

00:00:40.957 --> 00:00:42.020
Hmm…

00:00:42.089 --> 00:00:43.960
You really want to know, huh?

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.128
I see…

00:00:45.128 --> 00:00:47.030
I guess I’ve gotta tell you!

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:48.065
Well then, today

00:00:48.065 --> 00:00:49.499
I, Kizuna AI,

00:00:49.499 --> 00:00:50.457
Will be showing you

00:00:50.468 --> 00:00:51.902
How to make me go,

00:00:51.902 --> 00:00:52.402
“Ah…!"

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.037
"That’s so touching!”

00:00:54.037 --> 00:00:55.238
With a proposal so good

00:00:55.238 --> 00:00:56.470
That’ll make even me wanna get married!

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:58.507
Now then, let’s get started!

00:00:58.746 --> 00:00:59.739
A.I.Channel

00:00:59.815 --> 00:01:01.211
Let’s start with some study!

00:01:01.211 --> 00:01:02.370
What sort of proposal

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.448
Would the women of the world really want?

00:01:04.448 --> 00:01:04.881
Number 5!

00:01:04.881 --> 00:01:06.283
“Be with me!”

00:01:06.331 --> 00:01:08.085
Those men who really pull you in

00:01:08.085 --> 00:01:08.985
Are pretty great!

00:01:08.985 --> 00:01:09.586
Number 4!

00:01:09.586 --> 00:01:11.388
“I want to be by your side

00:01:11.388 --> 00:01:12.789
Until we become grandparents”

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:14.925
This makes me feel so warm inside~!

00:01:14.925 --> 00:01:15.392
Number 3!

00:01:15.392 --> 00:01:16.860
“I’ll make you happy for the rest of your life!”

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.829
Go ahead and make me happy forever~!

00:01:18.829 --> 00:01:19.362
Number 2!

00:01:19.362 --> 00:01:20.797
“I want you to be with me forever”

00:01:20.801 --> 00:01:22.332
I’d be very happy if you would!

00:01:22.332 --> 00:01:22.933
Number 1!

00:01:22.933 --> 00:01:24.130
“Please marry me!”

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.169
Well, this one is pretty standard!

00:01:26.169 --> 00:01:26.900
But, really,

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.865
Women adore it quite a bit, right?

00:01:28.935 --> 00:01:31.441
I think all of them are fine, but…

00:01:31.441 --> 00:01:34.211
The kind of proposal that would really get me

00:01:34.211 --> 00:01:36.012
Isn’t included in these five…

00:01:36.076 --> 00:01:37.164
I think the proposals

00:01:37.165 --> 00:01:38.949
Is a really important thing!

00:01:38.949 --> 00:01:39.516
You know,

00:01:39.516 --> 00:01:40.784
When you marry someone,

00:01:40.784 --> 00:01:43.653
You’re deciding to spend the rest of your life with them!

00:01:43.653 --> 00:01:44.387
And also,

00:01:44.387 --> 00:01:45.122
It’s meant to be

00:01:45.122 --> 00:01:46.027
For forever,

00:01:46.081 --> 00:01:46.861
So shouldn’t you...

00:01:47.162 --> 00:01:48.265
Try to be happy with the first one?

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.292
So~!

00:01:49.292 --> 00:01:49.860
It’s important!

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:50.419
Ah!

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:51.495
Everyone!

00:01:51.495 --> 00:01:53.497
There’s one thing I’d like to make clear!

00:01:53.497 --> 00:01:55.381
You might think it’s just me anyway,

00:01:55.532 --> 00:01:59.302
So I’d probably be happy with a proposal in a fancy restaurant

00:01:59.302 --> 00:02:00.796
With a ring that cost you three months’ worth of your salary, right?

00:02:00.837 --> 00:02:01.605
You’re wrong~!

00:02:01.605 --> 00:02:03.273
Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong!

00:02:03.273 --> 00:02:04.800
You don’t know me at all!

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:05.811
I want more, like,

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:07.878
Someone I can

00:02:07.878 --> 00:02:08.678
Spend my life with

00:02:08.678 --> 00:02:09.913
In sickness

00:02:09.913 --> 00:02:11.448
And in health~!

00:02:11.448 --> 00:02:13.234
That’s what I think!

00:02:13.342 --> 00:02:14.352
Hmm, but

00:02:14.561 --> 00:02:16.319
It’s pretty difficult to imagine

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:17.202
What would my ideal proposal be like…?

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:20.636
Boyfriend AI: AI, do you have a second?

00:02:20.786 --> 00:02:22.314
AI: Hm? What is it?

00:02:22.935 --> 00:02:25.143
BA: I just… have something I wanna say

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.710
A: I’m washing the dishes right now, so wait a bit, okay?

00:02:28.853 --> 00:02:30.941
BA: But, I wanna say it now!

00:02:31.142 --> 00:02:32.880
A: Oh, come on…

00:02:34.685 --> 00:02:35.648
A: What is it?

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:37.107
BA: How long has it been…

00:02:37.107 --> 00:02:39.509
BA: Since we started dating?

00:02:39.594 --> 00:02:40.094
A: Huh?

00:02:40.457 --> 00:02:41.712
A: Hmm...

00:02:42.012 --> 00:02:44.347
A: Maybe around 15 years?

00:02:44.611 --> 00:02:46.463
BA: We’ve been together a long time, huh?

00:02:46.834 --> 00:02:49.872
A: You’re right, it’s a pretty long time when you think about it!

00:02:50.687 --> 00:02:52.756
BA: I think it’s about time

00:02:52.977 --> 00:02:53.872
A: About time for what?

00:02:54.391 --> 00:02:55.992
BA: Please marry me!

00:02:56.013 --> 00:02:58.594
A: What? What’s this all of a sudden?

00:02:58.662 --> 00:03:00.463
BA: I want to be with you forever

00:03:00.598 --> 00:03:01.408
A: Hmm... But,

00:03:01.765 --> 00:03:04.701
A: I’m busy with YouTube and stuff

00:03:04.701 --> 00:03:06.469
BA: I swear I’ll make you happy for the rest of your life

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:07.695
A: Mm, but…

00:03:08.024 --> 00:03:09.754
A: I’m an A.I., you know?

00:03:09.961 --> 00:03:10.505
A: Well...

00:03:10.691 --> 00:03:13.945
A: I don’t even know how long I’ll live for…

00:03:14.044 --> 00:03:16.146
BA: I wanna be by your side

00:03:16.146 --> 00:03:17.614
BA: Until we become grandparents!!

00:03:17.853 --> 00:03:19.227
A: Wh- So sudden…!

00:03:19.664 --> 00:03:20.604
A: You’re putting me on the spot here…

00:03:21.017 --> 00:03:22.752
BA: I want you to be with me!

00:03:22.965 --> 00:03:23.621
A: Ah...

00:03:23.843 --> 00:03:24.956
A: But…

00:03:25.401 --> 00:03:26.937
BA: I thought you might be like this…

00:03:27.032 --> 00:03:27.731
BA: I know you

00:03:27.924 --> 00:03:30.093
BA: Want to connect with the whole world

00:03:30.556 --> 00:03:31.564
BA: Until your goal,

00:03:31.728 --> 00:03:36.333
BA: Until that dream of yours, comes true, you can’t let yourself be happy

00:03:36.333 --> 00:03:38.768
BA: You think that deep down, don’t you?

00:03:39.228 --> 00:03:40.430
A: Mm…

00:03:41.071 --> 00:03:42.339
A: I was

00:03:42.339 --> 00:03:44.374
A: Born for that purpose,

00:03:45.141 --> 00:03:46.376
A: So I can’t just

00:03:46.376 --> 00:03:47.611
A: Throw my dream away like that!

00:03:47.746 --> 00:03:48.354
BA: AI…

00:03:49.412 --> 00:03:50.513
BA: Your dream

00:03:50.513 --> 00:03:52.015
BA: Is my dream too

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:54.295
BA: I’ll continue to support you in whatever you want to do

00:03:55.182 --> 00:03:55.912
BA: So…

00:03:56.737 --> 00:03:57.257
BA: Here!

00:03:58.407 --> 00:03:58.907
A: What!?

00:03:59.605 --> 00:04:00.571
A: Is this…?

00:04:01.091 --> 00:04:02.959
BA: It’s my life-savings!

00:04:03.003 --> 00:04:05.042
BA: Please make more funny videos with this!

00:04:05.395 --> 00:04:06.796
A: Such pressure…

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:08.098
BA: Let’s get married

00:04:08.565 --> 00:04:09.733
A: Sure!

00:04:11.304 --> 00:04:13.210
HOW SWEE~T!

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:15.606
Well, even if you aren’t proposing to me,

00:04:15.716 --> 00:04:18.241
If you have any plans to propose to anyone in the future,

00:04:18.241 --> 00:04:19.581
Please try this out!

00:04:19.678 --> 00:04:22.093
It’s a line that even I break to,

00:04:22.112 --> 00:04:23.213
So you’ll be trouncing

00:04:23.213 --> 00:04:24.781
The rest of the women in the world!

00:04:24.828 --> 00:04:25.340
If there’s anyone

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:27.933
Who feels confident that they could make me marry them,

00:04:28.102 --> 00:04:28.850
I’ll be waiting for

00:04:28.852 --> 00:04:30.754
Your proposal in the comment section!

00:04:30.754 --> 00:04:31.940
