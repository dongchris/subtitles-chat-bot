00:00:01.683 --> 00:00:02.183
Ah

00:00:03.698 --> 00:00:04.770
'Sup?

00:00:04.771 --> 00:00:06.397
Highly conscious about appearing interesting YouTuber

00:00:06.398 --> 00:00:07.405
Kizuna AI here!❤️

00:00:07.406 --> 00:00:08.325
Recently

00:00:08.326 --> 00:00:10.480
there have been a lot of people who

00:00:10.481 --> 00:00:11.917
want to become YouTubers

00:00:11.918 --> 00:00:12.712
This time

00:00:12.713 --> 00:00:14.247
for their sake

00:00:14.248 --> 00:00:17.080
This highly conscious about appearing interesting YouTuber Kizuna AI will

00:00:17.081 --> 00:00:19.009
tell you about frame of mind....

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.838
Mindset⤴

00:00:19.839 --> 00:00:21.420
That's what I want to tell you about

00:00:21.817 --> 00:00:22.595
Let's Go!!

00:00:22.871 --> 00:00:23.863
A.I. Channel

00:00:23.982 --> 00:00:24.482
Firstly!

00:00:24.483 --> 00:00:25.617
What a YouTuber

00:00:25.618 --> 00:00:27.632
needs for their mindset. Number 1!

00:00:27.633 --> 00:00:29.013
Play seriously

00:00:29.014 --> 00:00:29.688
You see

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:31.263
I believe being earnest

00:00:31.264 --> 00:00:33.679
and being serious are different things

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.904
I'm not talking about doing anything you want

00:00:35.905 --> 00:00:37.120
Seriously doing stupid things

00:00:37.121 --> 00:00:38.620
making fun

00:00:38.621 --> 00:00:39.417
That's what I'm talking about

00:00:39.418 --> 00:00:39.935
So??

00:00:39.936 --> 00:00:41.252
Recently

00:00:41.253 --> 00:00:42.258
Are you playing seriously?

00:00:42.259 --> 00:00:44.604
'I'm not gonna play any more'

00:00:44.605 --> 00:00:46.795
Have you ever thought of that?

00:00:46.796 --> 00:00:48.245
If you try just once!!

00:00:48.246 --> 00:00:49.560
It will definitely open

00:00:49.935 --> 00:00:50.800
Next Door

00:00:50.873 --> 00:00:52.818
Eh~ Mindset number 2!!

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:54.091
Believe Yourself

00:00:54.298 --> 00:00:55.957
To put it frankly,

00:00:55.958 --> 00:00:57.533
as expected there is

00:00:57.534 --> 00:00:58.985
consensus and...

00:00:58.986 --> 00:01:01.129
compliance and you will be completely

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:02.256
preoccupied with

00:01:02.257 --> 00:01:03.664
Your own vision

00:01:03.665 --> 00:01:04.934
will be lost!

00:01:04.935 --> 00:01:07.136
Once you are caught up in that bias

00:01:07.137 --> 00:01:09.773
your own existence will be tiny

00:01:09.774 --> 00:01:11.385
It will become tiny

00:01:11.386 --> 00:01:12.229
If that happens

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:15.352
you will lose the strength to carry on

00:01:15.353 --> 00:01:16.214
But then

00:01:16.215 --> 00:01:17.813
it seems like such a waste!!

00:01:17.814 --> 00:01:20.347
Then all your efforts will be in vain!!

00:01:20.348 --> 00:01:21.121
After all

00:01:21.122 --> 00:01:24.240
if you are planning to climb a large mountain

00:01:24.241 --> 00:01:27.546
and you have a car with big tyres and one with small tyres

00:01:28.112 --> 00:01:29.064
Which one do you want to drive?

00:01:29.072 --> 00:01:30.174
The answer...

00:01:30.175 --> 00:01:30.961
becomes clear!!

00:01:30.962 --> 00:01:31.795
Okay! Number 3!!

00:01:31.796 --> 00:01:33.220
The last mindset

00:01:33.648 --> 00:01:35.426
At any rate have fun!!

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:37.800
Okay! It's time for a simple quiz!!

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.318
What is the meaning of being a YouTuber?

00:01:40.433 --> 00:01:42.793
As a YouTuber, what is your objective?

00:01:43.198 --> 00:01:43.698
That’s right

00:01:44.055 --> 00:01:46.198
To entertain your viewers!!

00:01:46.207 --> 00:01:47.017
120 points!!

00:01:47.128 --> 00:01:50.021
Well, here’s an even easier question

00:01:50.022 --> 00:01:52.223
What should you do

00:01:52.224 --> 00:01:53.633
to entertain your audience?

00:01:53.634 --> 00:01:54.185
Hmm?

00:01:54.186 --> 00:01:55.645
Get into a slime bath?

00:01:55.758 --> 00:01:56.274
100 points!!

00:01:56.275 --> 00:01:57.083
That's obvious

00:01:57.492 --> 00:01:58.897
Hmm? Mentos Cola?

00:01:58.898 --> 00:01:59.564
100 points!!

00:01:59.565 --> 00:02:00.414
That's correct as well

00:02:00.415 --> 00:02:01.010
But, you know,

00:02:01.011 --> 00:02:03.178
isn't there is a much more important thing

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:03.971
you’re forgetting?

00:02:03.972 --> 00:02:06.093
On top of entertaining your viewers,

00:02:06.094 --> 00:02:07.434
this is the ultimate weapon!!

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.332
You yourself need to have the most fun!!

00:02:10.514 --> 00:02:11.348
120 points!!

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.998
Everyone lives by doing the things they like

00:02:13.999 --> 00:02:14.536
Well

00:02:14.537 --> 00:02:17.416
If you are not having the most fun, then what is the point?

00:02:17.417 --> 00:02:18.398
It all comes down to that

00:02:18.399 --> 00:02:20.317
It will definitely be conveyed to your viewers!!

00:02:20.318 --> 00:02:20.914
But

00:02:20.915 --> 00:02:22.476
I sometimes hear this as well:

00:02:22.477 --> 00:02:23.646
“In this video

00:02:23.647 --> 00:02:26.847
instead of Kizuna-san having the most fun...

00:02:26.848 --> 00:02:29.142
Kizuna-san is the only one not having fun…”

00:02:29.143 --> 00:02:29.724
Well...

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:30.702
Isn't that different...haha

00:02:30.703 --> 00:02:31.346
Okay!!

00:02:31.347 --> 00:02:33.577
Well, I said something this stupid

00:02:33.578 --> 00:02:35.839
I think as a YouTuber being stupid is fine

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.311
You can have a totally empty brain!

00:02:37.312 --> 00:02:38.839
After all a YouTuber

00:02:39.125 --> 00:02:41.030
is a job that comes from the heart!

00:02:41.031 --> 00:02:41.704
Well, excuse me

00:02:41.705 --> 00:02:43.632
I have an appointment now so I'll leave at that!!

00:02:45.978 --> 00:02:46.550
Eh?

00:02:46.551 --> 00:02:48.950
You are still at a loss whether to become a YouTuber or not?

00:02:48.951 --> 00:02:50.404
Hmm...

00:02:50.405 --> 00:02:52.033
Here’s a simple question ♪

00:02:52.034 --> 00:02:53.963
If the world would end tomorrow,

00:02:53.964 --> 00:02:55.314
what would you want to do today?

00:02:55.512 --> 00:02:56.465
The answer

00:02:56.466 --> 00:02:57.631
is clear, right?
