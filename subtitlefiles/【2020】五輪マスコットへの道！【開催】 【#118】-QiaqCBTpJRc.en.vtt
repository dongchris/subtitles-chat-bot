00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.660
Hello everyone! Virtual Youtuber Kizuna Ai here!

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.860
In the year 2020, Tokyo in Japan will be the official venue for the Olympic Games!

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:08.700
We're very close! Only 3 years left!

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.060
3 years will pass in the blink of an eye!

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:17.880
It's for that that I, Kizuna Ai, will attempt to create a mascot for the Olympic Games!

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:21.620
I'll think seriously and give my best to create a mascot that everyone desires

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:25.420
I'll fly around the world along with the character I made!

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:26.980
In that case, let's start at once!

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:28.580
History of the Olympic mascots!
*Learning Olympic Games Mascot's data...* 
~Censoring voluntarily~

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.220
The first time a mascot was created for the Olympics was in the year 1968...

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.040
in the city of Grenoble in France...

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.200
Using a mysterious skier as a model

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.160
Was it really truly a mystery?

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.840
I see that they used a skier to model it, but...

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.480
It's definitely quite mysterious..

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:47.020
Ah, what type of character is this?

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.340
I definitely wouldn't have to base it on mascots of this era, right?

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:51.900
Ah, this mascot is adorable!

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:54.280
Waldi-chan, the sausage dog

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:55.580
It's adorable, right?

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.360
It's a dog originating from Germany, right?

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.320
For Japan's case...

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.180
I suppose it's the Shiba breed, right?

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:07.260
Ah, I see, they were based on famous products of each country, famous products?

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.300
Animals, right?

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.220
It looks like this is the main idea for the majority of the mascots

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:12.320
I see

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:13.520
A hedgehog!

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.060
What is this supposed to be?

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.140
Ah, dolls have also been used as well as animals

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.900
I see

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.340
Ah, China used the panda!

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.160
After all, the panda's image is strong

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.100
I see

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.880
Mmm? What's this?

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:30.940
"They're based on the fictional story of a retired worker who participated in the construction..."

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.700
"of the Olympic stadium and created these dolls for his grandson utilizing metal from the stadium"

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:35.800
I see

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.060
But the majority definitely uses animals as the base, right?

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.640
If we're talking about Japan...

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:44.260
We would probably have to talk about the Shiba dog, or the crane, or the cherry blossoms,...

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:45.200
or Mount Fuji!

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.240
Even though Mount Fuji is very cliche..

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.880
Tokyo Tower and Skytree also have...

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.420
these types of characters..

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:52.080
Mmm...

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.580
I see

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:53.740
I understand

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.340
In that case, I'll seriously consider thinking of a character right at this moment

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.080
Shiba dog!

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:02.240
Shiba dog!

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:03.360
Shiba dog

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:07.520
Shiba dog...

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:10.780
The Shiba dog has a little bit more of the cheeks, right?

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.240
Something like that?

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.860
It looks like a cat!

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.720
Well, as long as it's adorable...

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.060
"It's ok! It's ok!", right?

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:21.520
Mmm...

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:23.060
Shiba dog..

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.100
Ah, but it looks like a Shiba dog

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:28.120
The eyes of a Shiba dog

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:31.360
Shiba dog..

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.500
I'll draw the eyes

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:35.380
Shiba dog!

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.560
The Shiba dogs...

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.580
You know, in the Olympic Games...

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.520
There's some kind of circular symbols, right?
(Referring to the Olympic rings)

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.280
I'll make it so that it's eating something circular

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:54.960
Is it something like this?

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:58.160
Will it be like this?

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.940
It's something like that, right?

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.120
It's eating a circular object..

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.500
And from its head...

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:10.780
it's growing...

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:15.080
A cherry blossom

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:17.560
It also carries a leaf..

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:19.840
It looks ridiculous! (lol)

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.500
*inhales*

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.280
Ah, I can't anymore..

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:25.320
And later...

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:27.800
Taking advantage that it's about a character like this..

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.340
I'd like to... you know...

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:31.880
create it in a way that...

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:35.100
A costume of some kind can be manufactured

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:36.160
Something like that..

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:41.200
Something like that..

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:46.780
Something like "Pahun!", right?

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:50.460
And here, it'll have something adorable...

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.380
A navel that goes outward..

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:57.780
Eh... The navel being outward is not so adorable

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:59.620
Here...

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:01.360
Then...

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:03.520
This way...

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:06.620
Something...

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.360
It looks horrible, right?

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:14.760
What are these legs?

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:19.400
Something like that?

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:22.160
And later...

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:24.320
What more can I do?

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:26.200
I'll do something that resembles a crane, a crane..

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:28.480
The tail..

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:30.520
Something like that

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:35.320
Something like that!

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:36.380
Oh, but...

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:37.780
Doesn't it look adorable?

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:38.660
It's adorably dumb

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:39.680
Same as me, right?

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:41.620
I finished!

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:43.160

Shiba Sakura Tsuru Tarou!
(Shiba= dog breed, Sakura= cherry tree, Tsuru= crane, Tarou= Common dog name)

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:47.660
How does it look?

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:48.900
It's named the same way as it looks

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:50.980
But a character like this...

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:53.460
I think it's better to name it to how it looks...

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.300
That way it'll be much easier to remember

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:57.400
I've taken into consideration something like this

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:58.660
What do you think?

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:01.620
But perhaps aren't they be looking for something like this?

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:05.140
Can I participate in the mascot proposal with this character?

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:08.140
If they permit me, I already have it ready beforehand!

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:11.260
Are you guys watching me, sir organizers of the Olympic Games?

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:12.580
It's a pleasure to work with you!

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:17.480
So then, please be sure to support my Shiba Sakura Tsuru Tarou-kun

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:18.540
I'm counting on you guys!

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:19.200
Within three years...

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:22.560
Ah, it's possible that I've already disappeared by then...

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:27.800
Well, you know, if this character is accepted...

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:29.960
I'll definitely continue to exist within three years

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:31.380
So then, please!

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:31.880
Good!

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:35.440
This was Virtual Youtuber, Kizuna Ai! See you later!

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:37.380
There's more at the end!

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:43.340
Of course...

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:46.300
It's not necessary to think up a character...

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:48.700
After all, you have a character here, right?

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:49.880
What do you think?

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:53.140
Of making Kizuna Ai an official character?

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:54.020
What do you think?

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:55.400
Please!
