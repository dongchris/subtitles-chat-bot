♪ Lalala, can you say it? ♪

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.180
♪ Can you say it? ♪
*Japanese Pokerap version*

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:07.100
Mmm?

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:10.820
Hello everyone! Virtual Pokemon Trainer Kizuna Ai here!

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:13.180
Instead of "Can you say that Pokemon?"

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:14.780
"Can you draw that Pokemon?"

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:16.240
Here we go!

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:19.200
"Porygon"... what's a Porygon? A plastic bag?

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:24.580
Ah...

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:27.340
Kind of like a tightened plastic bag...

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:29.040
It's tied up...

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:32.500
Since it's used as a trash bag...

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.500
It’s like he’s saying “shobobo”...

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:40.520
Here's the trash...

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:41.020
[Trubbish?]

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:43.860
But it has to be able to put trash in...

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.640
So his mouth is open...

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.840
*Ai-chan Porygon noises*

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:48.800
"Zubat"!

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.980
It's that... "Yeah! Super...
(Song: Yeah! Meccha Holiday by Matsuura Aya)

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:53.300
Holiday"

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.580
"Giddy hopes...

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:58.160
For the Summer..."

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.500
"Yeah! Zubat (with a bang)"

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:01.440
*laughs*

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:03.960
So stupid...

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.100
Zubat...

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.820
I think his mouth was wide open...

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:10.360
[Draws "Golbat" instead]

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:13.820
Something like this...

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.360
This... I finished! Zubat!

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.400
"Vaporeon"! Vaporeon... this is Eevee's...

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:22.720
Evolution, right?

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.500
I don't really know, so then...

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.280
Something... like this...

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:41.340
And like this...

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:48.260
Like Vaporeon!
(Japanese name: Showers)

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:51.680
Like, "We are showers!"

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:53.380
Next up is...

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:55.020
"Jolteon"!

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:57.040
I wonder what Jolteon is...

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:58.940
It feels like...

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:01.900
Lightning, right? Thunder...

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:06.540
Lightning and...

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:09.900
Eyes...

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:16.340
"Thunder!"

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.320
"Thunder!" Something like this... Jolteon...
(Japanese name: Thunders)

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.920
Okay, I'm finished! Jolteon is cute...

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.380
"Pikachu"! Ready, go!

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.440
*Fast Forwarded*
Pika, pika! Pikachu! Did you know? Pikachu's favourite food is Ketchup!

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.460
Tutututu… like this?

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:33.940
I feel like he’s too small...

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:35.900
Something like this? Oh, that's cute! Here, I'm finished!

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:37.280
That's cute...

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:40.940
Next up is... "Dragonite"! Ready, go!

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:42.400
Dragonite... Dragonite is something like this...

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:44.300
Like this, maybe?

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:46.240
Dragonite's tail is like this...

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.760
No?

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.180
Okay! Dragonite is finished!

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.680
"Slowbro"!

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:52.840
What was Slowbro like again?

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:54.180
I think...

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.340
He was like a frog, Slowbro...

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:57.920
What is Slowbro like?

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:59.220
*laughs*

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.340
I think he gave the sensation that he was always sleepy...

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.400
"Pidgeotto"! Pidgeotto is that you know, a bird

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.820
I think it had this appearance...

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:07.920
*strange Ai sounds*

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:08.800
And the mouth was something like…

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:09.720
Something…? Something like that?

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:10.220
*laughs*

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.840
What is this thing supposed to be?

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:11.660
*more strange sounds*

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:12.280
Something like that?

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.860
Pidgeotto!

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:13.360
*laughs*

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.860
It’s too simple, the drawing is really bad

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:17.900
The next one is, "Psyduck"!

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.340
Is Psyduck like that?

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:20.600
I think his eyes are like two dots

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:21.600
Psyduck?

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.060
I think Psyduck had a belly like this, it was like this, something like this?

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:25.560
Very good

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.660
*laughs* Like this, I guess

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:28.420
"Rattata"!

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:31.700
I think Rattata had scary eyes… extremely cautious too...

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:33.740
Like this? I think he had buckteeth...

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:34.780
Something like this?

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:36.040
Something...

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:37.940
Rattata... *laughs*

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:39.560
Next one is "Rapidash"!

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:40.780
Didn’t it look like a unicorn?

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:41.500
Something like this?

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:42.840
Like a unicorn...

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:44.400
A unicorn, with fire! Or something like that

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:45.100
Fire!

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:45.880
Something like that...

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:47.880
Here's Rapidash!

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:51.200
Tentacool! Ah, Tentacool is something like...

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:52.640
Sort of like this… A round fellow

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.920
The round things go here, I think

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:54.880
It looks an "Ohmu"
(From Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind)

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:55.640
Something like that

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.920
Like that?

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:58.960
Done!

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:01.000
"Seel"! Ah, well, Seel...

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.220
I sort of know it! Seel is sort of… like a chubby person

00:04:03.805 --> 00:04:04.805
Seel is...

00:04:05.045 --> 00:04:06.045
Like this

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:10.120
Here's Seel!

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:11.060
"Cubone"!

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:12.140
Cubone?

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:13.280
Ah, is Cubone like that?

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:16.240
A bone, I get it, I’ll draw a bone, he’s like biting a bone

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:18.740
Bones are his staple food

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:19.480
Like this, I guess?

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:20.240
How cute!

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.900
Like this?

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:22.020
"Exeggcute"!

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:23.160
Ah, I know this one!

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:24.820
It has three kinds of eggs

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:26.320
And they seem to be mad

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:27.200
If it evolves...

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:28.040
It will become Funassyi…
(Funassyi is Funabashi Chiba’s pet)

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.780
They’re mad

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:30.760
They’re mad, like they’re saying: "Why did you choose us?"

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:31.840
Good, done!

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:33.040
"Marowak"!

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:34.580
Marowak...

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:36.780
Marowak is a snake?

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:38.580
(The Japanese name "Garagara" is also the sound of rattling)

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:40.200
Marowak, it will be sad because of its name

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:41.460
He’s sad...

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:41.960
Poor thing

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.685
I feel sorry for it, so I'm going to give it a heart similar to the one I have...

00:04:45.685 --> 00:04:46.185
Hoi!

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:47.440
Bulbasaur!

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.440
Ah! What did it look like?!

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:50.960
For the moment, I think it had something like a bulb, right?

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:52.500
And under the bulb, it has its body

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:53.320
Something like that

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:54.460
That’s good, it had the form of a dog

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:55.280
It was something like this?

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:56.300
Something like this?

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:57.320
Like this, I guess?

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:59.700
I think I’m not that wrong

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:00.460
Ekans!

00:05:00.585 --> 00:05:02.440
"Ekans" was a snake, right?

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:03.835
Ekans is slim, something slim, right?

00:05:03.835 --> 00:05:04.835
And when he evolves, he turns into Arbok

00:05:04.835 --> 00:05:06.520
Shuboon! He is very angry too

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:07.420
Like that

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:08.120
Like that

00:05:08.355 --> 00:05:10.160
Like: "Don't mess with me! (Angry)"

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:10.720
Woah!

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:11.780
"Eevee"

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:13.140
"Eevee"...

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:14.980
I can sort of remember her, but...

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:18.660
How was Eevee? I think he was like kind of cute even though it was simple

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:20.660
*laughs* It’s sort of cute... sort of...

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:22.000
I think Eevee was something like that

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:22.600
Yes! It’s done!

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:24.200
It sort of looks like Pikachu

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:25.280
"Weepinbell"

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:26.780
Weepinbell is...

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:28.440
A bell suffering from depression?
(It's a pun)

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:29.570
He had a leaf on his back...

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:31.280
It’s a kind of plant that looks great

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:32.820
This guy is also angry

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:34.020
Isn't his chin too long?

00:05:34.695 --> 00:05:35.540
Ehm… Hehe

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:36.660
A bell suffering from depression

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:38.460
"Electabuzz"

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:38.960
Ah, I know Electabuzz!

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:39.480
Electabuzz is sort of...

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:40.350
Like this…

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:40.850
Like this, for the moment...

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:41.480
Eh? Sort of…

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:42.660
It look like a dubious clown

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:43.440
Like this? Something like that?

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:44.960
How scary! Good, this is Electabuzz

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:46.620
Wasn't it like this? Sort of?

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:47.120
[Mr. Mime?]

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:48.920
Was I wrong?

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:49.940
"Snorlax"

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:51.140
Snorlax, I see...

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:51.740
I know Snorlax

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:52.500
Snorlax is sort of…

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:54.000
Sort of like this

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:55.620
Like this?

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:57.360
Like this...

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:58.080
"A bed for everyone"

00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:59.620
Like this, it’s good

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:01.520
I want a Snorlax bed, alright?

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:02.880
"Kabuto"!

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:05.500
Kabuto… Kabuto is...

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:08.780
I'm certain it's a combination of a "Helmet +  Rhinoceros beetle" 
(Double pun)

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:10.600
I think, like this?

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:12.320
Kabuto! Here too...

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:13.000
*laughs*

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:14.220
*inhales*

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:15.460
What is this supposed to be?

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:17.600
I've combined the two and it looks like a UFO

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:19.720
"Rhydon"

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:21.140
Rhydon?!

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:21.740
Rhydon

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:22.360
*woosh, whoosh*

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:22.940
Rhydon?!

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:24.400
Something like that? Oh, that looks cool

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:25.540
*laughs*

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:26.260
Rhydon

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:27.140
Rhydon is like this, right?

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:28.940
It's Rhydon, thump?!
(Another amazing pun)

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:30.000
"Dewgong"

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:30.680
Dewgong...

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:32.840
Eh? I don’t think I can draw Dewgong’s face, Dewgong seems similar to Seel

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:35.960
Sho shon, sho shon, ah, that looks good, right? Good!

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:37.840
Like this?

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:39.220
*laughs* So awful...

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:40.840
"Diglett"

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:42.160
I might know Diglett!

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:43.580
It sort of looks like a sausage

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:45.340
Diglett is… like this?

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:46.960
You can see three of them
[Confusing it with Dugtrio]

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:48.640
Is it something like that?

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:49.280
Good!

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:50.480
They're done!

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:53.060
"Dodrio"

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:55.240
Isn’t this guy evolved from Doduo?

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:58.840
Mmm… it feels like this… the head should be fluffy

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:00.280
Eh?

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:01.660
Like this? Ehe...

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:03.400
Here, there are three heads...

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:04.460
Ah, it doesn’t look good...

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:05.980
"Gengar"!

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:07.340
Gengar? Gengar is...

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:07.840
Well...

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:08.800
Sort of like this?

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:09.720
Like this...

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:10.300
He looks like he’s grinning

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:11.740
Like this

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:12.780
I'm Gengar!

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:13.920
I'm Gengar!

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:14.960
Waaaaa...

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:16.240
*laughs*

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:17.520
Is it like this, you think?

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:20.120
"Koffing"! I know him

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:21.900
He's like a kind of bubble, right?

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:22.820
Sort of...

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:23.920
Sort of.. like this?

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:25.320
He's wearing a dubious facial expression, “Aaaah?”

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:27.820
Aaahn?

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:29.240
Like this?

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:30.900
Don't you think it looks nice?

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:32.580
I know "Jynx"!

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:33.400
Like this, right? Like this...

00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:36.120
She is something like this, these are her eyes and this is her hair

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:37.680
Yes, it's done!

00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:40.020
This is the one that’s closest to the original, right?

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:41.660
I can draw "Meowth"!

00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:42.300
Meowth…!

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:43.800
Meowth has a gold coin… has ears...

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:44.660
Something like that...

00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:45.560
Something like: “Pyoon”

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:46.760
Does it like like a cat, like this?

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:48.220
And also, Meowth is standing

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:49.300
*laughs*

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:50.820
Is it like this...?

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:53.260
And last, "Gloom"...

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:54.400
That's an insult, right?
(Japanese name: Stinking flower)

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:56.180
Like this? Finally...

00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:56.800
It sort of had this feeling...

00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:58.500
Gloom's kinda sad

00:07:59.080 --> 00:07:59.760
I’m Gloom...

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.200
Shuboboon, ton, ton

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:03.200
Yes! It's finished!

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:04.760
Cha, chaaan!

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:07.080
Yes! We're finished~!

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:10.080
I've definitely become a Pokémon master~!

00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:13.000
There’s more at the end!

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
Translated by: Bararo, Mitsukitten, Angrybunny, sirrequiem, Vortex, Lacrymac, and Zerch

00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:23.880
Of course, I’m...

00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:24.960
From Pokemon Sapphire!

00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:26.920
Yay, Pokemon!
