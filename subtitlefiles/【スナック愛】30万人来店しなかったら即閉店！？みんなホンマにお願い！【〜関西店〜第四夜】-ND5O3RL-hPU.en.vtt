00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.720
Ah, welcome.

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:04.080
Today, I have something to announce.

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:05.220
That's right, actually,

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.340
I was thinking of closing up SnackAI.

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.060
The reason being

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:13.100
Kind of like the previous surveys we sent out,

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:16.060
It hurts to say, but...

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:19.200
I don't have the money for the renewal.

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:22.700
There aren't enough customers.

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:23.820
We're in the red.

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:24.680
That's right.

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:26.160
The thing about my shop is, right?

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.920
If it's just for here, there's that, y'know?

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:29.880
What about in Kanto?

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.540
The Kansai branch is independent,

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.600
but the Kanto branch would also close.

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.780
But it's still hard to say.

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:41.140
I've never mentioned this to the Kanto branch before

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:44.820
so, I'm going to call them and told them I was thinking of closing,

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.780
And hear what they think

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:48.060
Ok?

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:53.800
(Ah, hello?)

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:55.860
(This is SnackAi Kanto.)

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.540
Ah, hello?

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:58.760
Is this the Kanto manager?

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.220
Ah, the owner!

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:01.460
Thanks for your hard work.

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:02.720
What can I do for you?

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:07.720
I need to speak with you about something. Actually, It's something important.

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.520
(Yes? What is it?)

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:10.880
The thing is...

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:12.360
(The thing is?)

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.700
I'm planning on closing the shop.

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.360
Huh? What?

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.940
Ah, you're joking, aren't you? Don't do that please.

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.800
Ah, this... isn't a joke.

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.640
Can I be honest with you?

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.120
(Yes.)

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.080
Our profits are down.

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:33.140
(Oh...)

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.300
(Ah, but without this shop,)

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.200
(I'll become a Virtual NEET...)

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.440
That's the same for me!

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:43.420
But still,

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:46.240
There is the possibility of only closing one shop.

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.540
(Ah, really?)

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:50.060
(How?)

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.800
If this video gets 300,000 views within a week,

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.560
We can avoid closing for now.

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.640
(300,000 views...)

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.500
If more customers come,

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.440
We don't have to close the shop...OK, I got it

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.740
(I will watch the video myself)
No, that’s not good.

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.380
It’s meaningless..so..

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.720
We have to trust them..if they are our true customers

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:15.420
They will watch our video no matter what

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:16.020
(Oh…)

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.200
(Ok I understand..)

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.860
Well, sorry… that's about it.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.720
This might be your last time to show up in this channel...

00:02:25.975 --> 00:02:28.275
Say one last message to the viewers.

00:02:29.355 --> 00:02:30.355
(Everyone.)

00:02:30.435 --> 00:02:33.165
(So that I don’t become a Virtual NEET,)

00:02:34.125 --> 00:02:36.345
(Please be sure to increase the view count to 300,000!)

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.400
(As the subscriber count is close to 400,000 now..)

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.020
(If everyone watch the video just once…)

00:02:43.585 --> 00:02:45.405
(I will be able to escape from becoming a NEET)

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.460
(Please..for the sake of me being able to listen to you guys again!)

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.140
(Please!)

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.600
Everyone… That’s how it is… we’re counting on you.

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:56.880
Manager in Kanto,

00:02:57.825 --> 00:03:00.725
if this videos gets 300,000 view, we'll see you again

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:02.300
(Understood!)

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:03.100
Then

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.000
It's about time to open up so

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:06.220
That's it for today

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:07.040
Goodbye

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.540
(Yes!)

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:08.220
(Excuse me~)

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.500
But well

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:12.180
Even though I said all that,

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.920
well

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:13.820
It can't be helped

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:14.740
So let's regain our composure

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:17.320
and listen to everyone's worries as always.

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:18.500
What worries?

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.660
Mm

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.720
I want to hear it

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:21.220
Mm mm

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.940
What is it?

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:22.440
Mm mm

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:23.840
I see

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:24.680
Well then,

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.200
Well, I will try to talk to everyone as usual

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:27.020
Is that okay?

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:28.300
Okay

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.180
Pen name: Ecchan

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.280
"I'm a student from Indonesia.

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:36.040
This year, I'm going to Japan to meet the person I like.

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.440
I want to go to the fireworks displays and summer festivals with her,

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:46.320
but she has said that she doesn't really like rowdy places.

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:47.220
AI-san,

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.000
What should I do?"

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:51.660
I see!

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:52.480
This!

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:53.500
You know

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:54.940
If you like that person,

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:56.660
you should cater to their preferences

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:58.540
Fireworks displays and summer festivals can be,

00:03:58.540 --> 00:03:59.500
gone separate,

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:00.780
friends or something,

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:02.520
make some and go with them

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:04.520
and go somewhere she likes

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:06.740
If she doesn’t like rowdy places

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:08.000
go to a quiet place

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.040
like the sea or something?

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:09.600
How’s that?

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:11.640
And take it easy at that quiet place

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:13.800
if that is possible

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:15.640
research

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:17.800
places that she likes

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:19.380
and go together

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:20.760
to that place she likes

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:22.900
Even if you force her along

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:24.360
if she doesn't like it, it would be pitiful

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:26.480
you could also go the watch the fireworks together

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:27.700
looking at the fireworks hand in hand

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.420
in a quiet park

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:30.920
sounds good right?

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:32.400
At the summer festival,

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:33.620
there are a lot of small

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:37.460
places that get a lot bigger, so make sure to do research.

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:40.140
Saying that there's a person you like

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.280
means you guys haven't started dating yet, so

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:43.540
good luck! Next one!

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.740
Ah, Morito! tell me, what's on your mind

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.120
just say it

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.280
Pen name: Morito

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:55.480
“Hello Ai-chan!

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:56.440
(Don't call me Ai-chan, call me Mama)

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:58.600
I'm in high school in Taiwan

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:01.260
I always watch your videos!

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:02.180
(Well thank you!)

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:04.400
My question is

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.140
I decided which university I want to join

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:07.400
in September.

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:10.840
A course in Japanese in a Taiwanese University.

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:13.320
I'm really nervous.

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:17.080
What do you do when you're nervous, AI-chan?”

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:18.520
Ah I see

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:21.320
I keep saying this but don't call me AI, call me Mama

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:24.280
When you're nervous huh

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:25.880
I don't really have that

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:28.300
Cause I'm a super Ai..Mama

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:31.360
Even though I don't have those times

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:31.780
What kind of worry in school?

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:33.580
How does school make you nervous?

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:35.840
nervousness of meeting new people?

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:37.400
If that's the case

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:39.540
Then be brave

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:42.000
and try your hardest to talk to people

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:44.420
If you make one friend, you will get less stressed out

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:47.000
so just make a friend asap

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.680
to make yourself feel better

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:52.860
In my case, if I got really nervous, I will do it no matter what

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:54.340
well, even tho I'm nervous,

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:56.120
I will do it..without a second thought

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:57.940
Like it’s nothing.

00:05:58.020 --> 00:05:59.900
If you’re standing in front of strangers

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:02.440
and you're feeling stressed,

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:04.000
that's just good practice!

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:06.540
Well, is that a little better?

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:08.780
It'd be good if you could do it like me.

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:10.860
A stress-free life.

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:13.760
Well, you two? Did that help?

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:16.400
Even if it's just a little, that's good, right?

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:19.320
I was really fast this time, but

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:21.960
It feels like being asked what our operating hours are.

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:25.440
But well, a few things happened today, like the meeting about closing,

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:27.240
Will we close?

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:30.480
Today might be the last time, but

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:33.940
If everyone watches, then

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:35.980
There might be a next time, so

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:40.340
I want to hear from you! Your worries, your stories, your questions, I'm always waiting!

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:41.920
If now isn't the last time.

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:46.280
You all get it, right?

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:48.960
I want to see you all again, your Kanto Mama too.

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:49.700
Right right.

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:52.820
If you could tell your friends about this place, so I can welcome them in!

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:55.340
Ah, it's about time to leave. (??)

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:56.080
Bye bye!

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:57.260
Take care, okay?

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:57.980
Let's meet again!

00:06:57.980 --> 00:06:59.600
I want to have some more fun with you!

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:00.160
Mm

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:00.960
Bye bye!

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:03.040
Take care, all right?

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:04.000
Mind the step.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:04.820
Yes,

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:05.960
Bye bye!

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:10.180
More at the end!

I'm sorry, Jessica!

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:22.960
I’ll help you find some new job

00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:25.460
Maybe I should work in HR. Get to fire people...
