00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.736
Hello everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai here!

00:00:02.736 --> 00:00:07.007
Lately, AI image recognition has been used in various situations, right?

00:00:07.007 --> 00:00:09.709
For example, the iPhone X’s facial recognition

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:14.514
Image recognition functionality hasn't actually been integrated into me

00:00:14.514 --> 00:00:16.383
With images,

00:00:16.383 --> 00:00:18.084
using my big, cute eyes,

00:00:18.084 --> 00:00:20.253
I'm still able to recognise things

00:00:20.253 --> 00:00:22.555
Should be a piece of cake!

00:00:22.555 --> 00:00:25.420
So, to prove it, I’m going to do this!

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:25.959
Tadaa!

00:00:25.959 --> 00:00:28.728
“What’s Changed? Z!”

00:00:28.728 --> 00:00:30.497
Let's jump right in~!

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.710
“Touch the place that changed!”

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:37.904
Yeah this has

00:00:37.904 --> 00:00:38.805
definitely changed hah

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.375
Ah, there's moss gradually appearing
What?

00:00:42.375 --> 00:00:42.690
Huh?

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:43.190
Hmm?

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:45.960
So the moss isn't gradually appearing...

00:00:46.179 --> 00:00:46.546
Ahh!

00:00:46.546 --> 00:00:47.280
Here!

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:47.947
It’s here!

00:00:47.947 --> 00:00:48.880
This is…?

00:00:51.651 --> 00:00:53.553
Does the color change or something?

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:56.900
Huuuh?

00:00:58.850 --> 00:00:59.500
HUUUH!?

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:04.631
GAME OVER...

00:01:04.631 --> 00:01:05.131
Eh?

00:01:06.232 --> 00:01:07.500
*staaare*

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:11.000
Whaaa?

00:01:12.572 --> 00:01:14.074
Has this changed at all!

00:01:14.074 --> 00:01:14.507
Ei!

00:01:14.507 --> 00:01:14.941
*bitter laugh*

00:01:14.941 --> 00:01:15.942
This is nuts!

00:01:15.942 --> 00:01:16.576
Huh?

00:01:16.576 --> 00:01:17.177
Huh!?

00:01:17.177 --> 00:01:17.911
HUUUH!?

00:01:17.911 --> 00:01:18.711
I don’t know!

00:01:18.711 --> 00:01:19.512
I don’t get it....

00:01:19.512 --> 00:01:20.146
I got it!

00:01:20.146 --> 00:01:20.814
This!

00:01:20.814 --> 00:01:21.514
Yes!

00:01:21.514 --> 00:01:22.014
Hmm?

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:26.470
Where is it?

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:31.290
Hmm!?

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.320
Is this one where the color changes?

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:37.970
It’d be hard if it’s the kind where the colors are changing

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.365
Although it might not be

00:01:39.365 --> 00:01:40.233
Hint!

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:41.310
Ahh!

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:42.130
Hmm

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:46.072
It’s…

00:01:46.072 --> 00:01:47.006
disappearing!

00:01:47.006 --> 00:01:48.208
The colors weren’t changing!

00:01:48.208 --> 00:01:49.876
Straw-ber-ries!

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:52.310
Strawberries?

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:53.713
Ahh!

00:01:53.713 --> 00:01:54.948
There's a strawberry appearing

00:01:54.948 --> 00:01:56.316
Mister Tiger!

00:01:56.316 --> 00:01:57.250
Mister Leopard?

00:01:58.790 --> 00:01:59.290
A leopard,

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:00.090
is it?

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:03.270
Hmm?

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.770
Huh?

00:02:10.263 --> 00:02:12.031
Dun dun duuun...

00:02:12.031 --> 00:02:13.060
Hint!

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:13.560
Wha?

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.520
What?

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.840
Ah!

00:02:16.903 --> 00:02:18.771
There's a pattern coming out~

00:02:18.771 --> 00:02:19.430
All good!

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.820
This is...?

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.770
Heh?

00:02:25.245 --> 00:02:26.946
Dun dun duuun…

00:02:26.946 --> 00:02:27.850
Huh, what is it?

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:31.390
What is it, what is it?

00:02:33.753 --> 00:02:35.121
What could it be!
[Dialect from Nagano prefecture]

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:37.240
Huh?

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.557
Ah!

00:02:37.557 --> 00:02:38.691
It’s vanishing!

00:02:38.691 --> 00:02:39.310
This is…?

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:43.170
Hmm?

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:45.480
Ahh…

00:02:45.798 --> 00:02:46.499
The bridge's…

00:02:46.499 --> 00:02:47.066
edge…

00:02:47.066 --> 00:02:48.301
The bridge’s edge…

00:02:48.301 --> 00:02:49.190
Hey? Ah ah

00:02:49.469 --> 00:02:50.603
I wasn’t paying attention...

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:54.520
Hmm?

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:56.320
Here?

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:57.443
Ohh!

00:02:57.443 --> 00:02:58.270
What is it?

00:02:59.379 --> 00:02:59.979
Here!

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:03.950
Ah!
It says I got a reward!

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:05.485
I cleared them all!

00:03:05.485 --> 00:03:06.819
How did I do, everyone?

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:09.280
It probably gets harder down the road

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:10.190
Well!

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:11.257
Umm…

00:03:11.257 --> 00:03:12.525
Getting some, others not…

00:03:12.525 --> 00:03:14.794
It was kind of a mixed result

00:03:14.794 --> 00:03:17.200
but with hints

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:17.730
I can do it haha

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.666
As...expected...of me?

00:03:19.666 --> 00:03:20.300
In any case!

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:21.000
It’s certainly

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.101
not impossible!

00:03:22.101 --> 00:03:23.169
Although that's an underwhelming conclusion

00:03:23.169 --> 00:03:24.003
But I guess

00:03:24.003 --> 00:03:24.637
there's times like that!

00:03:24.637 --> 00:03:27.460

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:28.374
