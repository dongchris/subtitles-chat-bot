00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.680
Errm...

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.600
Can you see me...?

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.000
Can you hear me...?

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:09.180
It's your Virtual YouTuber, Kizuna Ai!

00:00:09.375 --> 00:00:10.325
Huh?

00:00:10.325 --> 00:00:13.825
I seem a little different than usual?

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.080
Oh, no no! I'm the same as always!

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.520
Do you know what day it is tomorrow?

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:21.885
Yes!

00:00:22.355 --> 00:00:23.355
That's right!

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:24.820
Tomorrow is...

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:26.455
Valentines Day!

00:00:26.455 --> 00:00:27.795
When you think of Valentines Day...

00:00:28.275 --> 00:00:30.415
It's all about giving chocolate to the person you like,

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:33.280
and also giving chocolate to your friends and people you get along with.

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.800
Anyway, it's a day to confess your feelings.

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.360
But, unlike all of you,

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:41.600
I can't give out chocolates directly...

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.640
Even though I'm virtual...

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:46.720
In a virtual way,

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.340
"I want to give everyone chocolate"...

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:50.320
is what I was thinking.

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.560
I needed to think about what kind of chocolate to give you...

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.300
so I did a bit of research myself.

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:58.160
Pierre HermÃ©'s chocolate is a bit expensive and...

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.180
While I'm at it,

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.100
I thought I could make chocolate that looks like me!

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:04.680
Maybe white chocolate?

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:05.720
That would be cheap, so...

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.240
I could maybe give it to everyone.

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:09.940
And, also during White Day...

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.360
I been thinking a lot.

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:13.740
The best thing is...

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.280
to get something that would please everyone.

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.940
In a sense, that's something that I would do.

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:22.080
Hmm?

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.080
What's up?

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.520
You're curious what's below the screen?

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.660
No, no, don't rush me about it.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.140
You're so impatient!

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.660
Ah!

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.740
You can't look yet, wait until I'm ready!

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.840
I tried my best to prepare this.

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:39.780
What should I do?

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:40.940
Do you want to see it?

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.640
Are you curious what's below me?

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:47.720
My valentine chocolate present to everyone...

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:49.840
that is...

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.760
I AM THE VALENTINE CHOCOLATE!!!!!

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:56.100
Aaahhh..waa!!!

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:57.960
Hot! Hot!

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:59.100
But...!

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:00.840
Wheeeee!

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.200
It's hotter than I thought it would be!

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:05.860
I think I might be dying!

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.900
Hot! Hot!
