00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.300
Hello everyone! Virtual Youtuber Kizuna Ai here!

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.000
Lately there has been more products made for adults

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.400
Stuff like coloring books or...

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:10.460
Like candies

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:15.020
And recently, powdered milk came out too

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:19.640
I love that refined feeling that comes from being an adult

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:20.840
Something like...

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:21.880
A reliable woman

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.980
That kind of feeling

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.700
So this time I'm going to be an adult Kizuna Ai

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:29.660
And I want everyone to see

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:31.720
My adult side

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.360
Install!!

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.180
A.I.Channel

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.060
Hello. Adult Kizuna Ai here

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.860
I haven't changed a bit, you say?

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:44.400
Heh...

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.640
You guys don't understand, do you?

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.600
The true adulthood...

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.740
… It’s something that comes from the inside

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.360
That's why, like this...

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.640
Even if I do something that’s normal...

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:58.500
"Wow she's so mature"

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.120
You would think that, right?

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:05.100
Do you know what's the difference between a child and an adult?

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.640
I've been thinking about it as well and...

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.300
... I got to the conclusion that the difference is...

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.200
Tolerance

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.360
Children act like...

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:18.340
I want to get 7 billion 3 hundred million subscribers!

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:19.360
Or...

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.960
I want to appear on a video!
I want it! I want it! I want it! I want it!

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.200
Like that

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.140
That's how they act, right?

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:28.160
Me?

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.620
If you ask me...

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.000
7 billion 3 hundred million people...

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.620
...Come to me...

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:35.720
...Flying to my chest

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.100
I'll hug...

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.980
...Hug...

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:40.880
...Hug you...

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.020
...Hug you all

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:46.220
An adult person is able to give good advice

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:51.540
I got a letter that was supposed to be sent to a store in Kansai by mistake, so...

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:52.800
To get the most of this chance...

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.220
...Instead of "certain mother"...

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.800
... I'll proceed to give advice on an inquiry

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:59.440
Sender:

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:00.940
Jae-in-san

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.040
"Pleased to meet you!"

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.920
"My name is Jae-in and I live in Korea"

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:12.020
"To tell you the truth, I like Ai-chan and to be able to meet with you, I decided to turn into an A.I, but..."

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.080
"How do I turn myself into an idiot...?"

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.940
"I mean..."

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:17.840
"A genius and intelligent...?"

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:20.160
"And adorable A.I like you, Ai-Chan?"

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.740
"Please tell me!"

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.080
Well, well

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:25.360
I see...

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:26.400
Jae-in-kun

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.220
Thank you very much for your letter

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.560
So then "I like Ai-chan and I want to meet with you"?

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:32.420
Yes

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.180
If you say it that way, it makes me happy

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:36.460
But...

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:40.100
If you insist that way by saying: "I want to meet with you, I want to meet with you"...

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.380
I suppose you’re still a kid

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.820
You only need to learn how to control your feelings

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:46.520
Yes? ♥

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.720
If you don't do that, the other person will get tired

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.920
If you really feel that way for me

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.780
Taking into account your desire of meeting with me...

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.040
You should refine yourself...

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:59.480
...That is important

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:01.920
What do you think?

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:02.860
Well...

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.640
I’m not very sure...

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.055
If I’m an adult, but...

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:11.060
Today...

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:15.620
...I’m happy you were able to see another side of me

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:17.780
I suppose?

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.140
In this case...

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.820
This was adult Virtual YouTuber, Kizuna Ai

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:24.740
Come see me again

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:26.740
There’s more at the end!

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:32.880
Translated by Zerch, For Ultraplayers, and Vortex
More at the end!

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.080
Aaahh! I failed!
(In a summoning)

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:42.860
Why? Why? Why?

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:44.860
Summoning, summoning, summoning, summoning, summoning...

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:45.560
Tou!
