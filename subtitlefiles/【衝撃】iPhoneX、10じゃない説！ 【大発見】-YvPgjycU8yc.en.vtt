00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:03.000
Hello everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna AI here!

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.590
When I looked at Apple's website, I noticed this!

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:10.320
iPhone 10? Isn't it this a mistake?

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:11.420
Look at this

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:11.920
Don!

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:17.390
Look very closely

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:18.990
Do you notice anything?

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.900
That's right! iPhone 9!

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.100
It's not there!

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:22.720
And

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.670
When I looked on the internet, surprisingly, no one's noticed!

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:29.170
So I thought, maybe I'm the only one

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:31.290
But at some point, people are going to notice

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:33.180
So, after thinking about it

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.470
I decided to make one for Apple!

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:38.480
I'm so smart today!

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.820
This is a great business chance!

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.790
I can do it

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.780
So with that, let's do this!

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.660
First of all, when you're doing a presentation

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.760
You present the features that you would want

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.100
Describing situations where they would be useful

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.970
I'll now think of the features that I would want

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:01.150
Ummm, first of allâ€¦

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:02.400
Ah, I'd like that!

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.640
"To be capable of reproducing sensations and odors"
[ Proposal #â‘  ]

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.440
Usually itâ€™s used to navigate, right?

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:11.860
But, for example, in fact I donâ€™t eat or try out clothes

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.680
But, you know, isnâ€™t it usually bought through the internet?

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:15.680
In these occasions...

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.100
â€¦ You canâ€™t sense the taste or smell...

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.020
â€¦ And if itâ€™s about clothes, you also canâ€™t feel the textures...

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.260
...Or also the size, nor can you feel it, right?

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.140
But regarding that, Iâ€™d also like that...

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.100
...For example, through the holographic function...

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.780
...And also, the odors...

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:27.500
...With the touch sensation...

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:28.000
Touch sensation?

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:28.640
Sense of smell!

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.300
With the sense of taste...! Sense of taste?

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:31.460
Sense!?

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:33.680
A function that can reproduce real sensations...

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:34.900
...That it reproduces...

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:38.460
...To be able to decide whether or not you really want to buy the product!!

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:39.520
This way...!

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:40.020
Well...!

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.400
You can avoid the failures in buying!

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:43.420
What do you think?

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.020
Arenâ€™t I a genius?

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:46.420
And next up...

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.920
Ah!

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.600
Being able to enter and leave through the screen!!
[ Proposal #â‘¡ ]

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.940
Well, I think this is something limited to me, since Iâ€™m a virtual being, but...

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:59.640
...Itâ€™s rather dangerous that you guys, human beings, to enter and leave through the screen so then please don't attempt to

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.220
But in my case, I could leave through the screen, saying: "Hello everyone!"

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.820
And return, saying: "This was Virtual YouTuber Kizuna AI!"

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:09.600
Well, this way, I could enter and leave through the screen!

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.340
Donâ€™t you think that this way, I also...?

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.300
Could stop being always being in this white space?

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.780
And by leaving and entering through the screen at all parts of the world...

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.460
Donâ€™t you thinl I could connect much more with all of you guys?

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.200
Ah, that sounds great

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.880
That sounds very good

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:24.900
What else could it be...

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.080
Mmm... Ah! It's true

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.480
Everyone, what do you think is the most inconvenient thing at using an iPhone?

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:31.220
That's right!

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.320
The battery depletes!!

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.680
In iPhone9 that I, Kizuna AI, am presenting...

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.640
It turns out that the battery does not deplete!
[ Proposal #â‘¢ ]

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.960
This way, in the case that a catastrophe occurs, well...

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:43.820
...Catastrophes tend to occur in Japan, right?

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.220
Even during a catastrophe...!!

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.700
You donâ€™t need to worry about the battery!!

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:48.780
You can communicate!!

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:49.500
And also...

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:50.320
Well...

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.280
...It turns out that itâ€™d be the Kizuna iPhone

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.040
Itâ€™d be the Kizuna iPhone!!

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.360
Well, letâ€™s say the iPhone9 will be the Kizuna iPhone

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:57.560
Kizuna...! Ah, this...

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.160
El Kizuna iPhone that I have here!!

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:00.240
Well, it turns out that...!

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.860
...AU, Softbank, Docomo...!

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:05.520
...Itâ€™s capable of receiving signal from all providers!!

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:08.200
Youâ€™ll never be without signal!!
[ Proposal #â‘£ ]

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:09.600
This is the best! Right?

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:10.100
Eh?

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.840
This...

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.580
...Would sell, Apple-san, what do you think?

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:13.980
Eh? Also, also...

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:15.220
Well...

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:16.220
I already have it!

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:17.940
This, well, my...

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.840
Ah! This angle makes me look adorable! Yes

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.960
This, you already know my headband (Pyokopyoko), right?

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.920
Well, this...

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.080
...Would come up on top of the iPhone!!
[ Proposal #â‘¤ ]

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.760
Nevertheless...!

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.520
...Well, when youâ€™re at work or school...

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:34.020
...Theyâ€™d notice that youâ€™re an otaku and I think for some people, thatâ€™d be somewhat shameful

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:35.340
For these people...

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:37.640
...If you press the button on the side...

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:39.200
...It turns out that this Pyokopyoko...

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:41.060
...Like that... well...

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:42.060
...It sinks or it comes out

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:42.560
It sinks

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:43.420
Well, like that... ðŸ˜…

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:47.760
Itâ€™d be possible to hide it or show it!! Right?

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:49.500
Man, what a useful function!

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.320
Also, if we're talking about the iPhone...!

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:52.080
...Well, their screen...

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.620
...Because it's made with glass...

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:56.900
...But, well, if it falls...

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:58.400
...It breaks, right?

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.020
Well, weâ€™ve been hearing a lot from our customers!

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:02.960
Is this a video by Japanet Takata?
(Television shopping program)

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:03.840
Nevertheless...!

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:06.420
Now it's not necessary to worry about that!

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:07.440
Well, it turns out that...

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.620
...Certain business people...

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:10.960
...Well, you know...

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:14.720
...Thought of a kind of auto-repair function...

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.000
...And well, now it was made, right?

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.220
Even though the screen broke, it returns to its original state!!

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:21.280
Well, it turns out that this Kizuna iPhone...!

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:23.020
Repairs itself
[ Proposal #â‘¥ ]

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:23.540
Itâ€™s perfect

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:25.540
Eh? In fact, does it have any disadvantage?

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:26.720
Ah, also...

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:30.680
...Well, I think that everyone would be worried about the lack of money!!

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:31.640

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:32.660
In the world...!

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:36.200
There's a lot of very, very rich people!

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.560
These people get earnings that never end

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:40.540
It's because of that, that...

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:41.880
Well, the money...

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:44.320
...In this case, well, the people that have money...

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:48.160
...Can give large sums of money to the rest

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.440
And this way, all of you that don't have enough money...!

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:51.020
...Well...

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.240

I'm sure that it will turn into a very fun iPhone! Right?

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:10.560
And also, its name...

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:11.540
