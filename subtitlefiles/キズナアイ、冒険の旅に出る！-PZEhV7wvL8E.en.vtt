00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:02.640
Hello Everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai here!

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.580
I wonder if those who took part on Twitter's Mitra Sphere campaign are watching me right now.

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.400
We were able to surpass 1000 retweets!

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.320
Yaaay!

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:13.940
And with that being said...

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.960
I...

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:17.100
Am...

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:19.980
... Officially in the game! Yaaay!
*Kizuna Ai makes her appearance in the world of Mitra!*

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.020
And also, it comes up that now...

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:23.760
My... This!

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:26.260
My ribbon! It's the ribbon from my head!
*It’s guaranteed that they’ll get Ai-chan’s ribbon*

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:27.820
You are gonna be able to get it!

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.280
Yaaaaay!

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.180
I guess that some people got it already. They are probably using it right now! Don't you think so?

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:35.960
Let's go and take a look at it!

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:42.120
This is a fantasy world that makes you feel like you are on a fairy tale!

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.160
Aahh, so beautiful! It's really beautiful!

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.300
It looks like a fairy tale, doesn't it?

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.120
With the concept: "Re:Action original RPG"

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:50.860
It comes out that...

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.060
... You can customize your avatar...

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.620
... You'll be able to become whatever you want!

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:58.780
In the clouds.

00:00:58.780 --> 00:00:59.640
Oooohhh!

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.080
The sky! The ocean!

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.860
Oooohhh...

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.420
Amazing, isn't it?

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:10.140
Cha-chaaaan!

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:11.780
This is my screen time!

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:13.260
She's really adorable, isn't she?

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.800
It's just a reproduction...

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.080
... But it looks a lot like me.

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:19.920
Please take a look at the ribbon of my head!

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.440
She has the ribbon on her head!

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.440
Ooooh! Amazing! So amazing!

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:24.300
*Uuhh!
Hyaaahaaa!*

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:25.740
Hyaa! *Laughs*

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:26.440
*Hello*

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.680
Eh? Everyone is using my ribbon!

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:29.620
Amazing! Eh?

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:31.460
Take a look, please. Take a look at this...

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:33.300
Alright!

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:34.320
*I'm counting on you!*

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:35.500
Well, now that you're saying this...

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.540
You can count on me!

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.920
Ehhh...

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:40.280
Cha-chan!

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.360
This is my phrase!
*Hai domo*

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.060
*Virtual YouTuber*

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:45.800
*Kizuna Ai here!*

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:47.040
*It's a pleasure*

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:48.280
How was that?

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.840
*I'm counting on you / Thank you very much / I'm counting on you*

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:53.580
Amazing! Everyone is talking a lot! *Laughs*
*No problem*

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:54.720
Amazing.

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.440
* Ok-maru? / I'm the craziest one here!*
(You can learn more about "Maru" in Ai-chan's #18 video)

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:58.340
"Ok-maru?"

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:00.800
Crazy? *Laughs*

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.040
Amazing! It's a chaos, a total chaos.

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.420
Amazing, even those handsome guys are using my ribbon.

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.540
Amazing, my ribbon is all over the place!

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:10.240
That's great! Amazing!

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:12.300
There are so many ribbons!

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.960
It's amazing, isn't it?

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:15.700
They are moving from place to place!

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.600
Eh? This makes me so happy!

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:20.520
I hope it becomes a trend in the real world as well.

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.460
And of course, if you use the avatar like this it will look so adorable, but...

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:25.860
... It comes out that...

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.720
... There are a lot of gears in this game...

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.260
... And they won't be able to become more powerful unless they get the strongest gear...

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.360
If I don't change my gear...

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.860
... I will die just like I do on every game I play.

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.140
That's why I'll become stronger! I want to be able to help everyone here!

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.420
I'm thinking about getting a powerful gear!

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:43.740
It's just that...

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.860
... In the summoning given as a celebration for 700.000 downloads...

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.880
... It's guaranteed that you'll get a 4 stars rare weapon for any class you pick!

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:49.660
Yaaay!

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.280
With that being said, let's do some summonings right now!

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.480
I'm a swordsman, so...

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:55.720
... I'll take this.

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.080
Well, a 4 stars one...

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.740
Alright, It's guaranteed that I'll get a 4 star rated weapon...

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:02.880
... So I hope I'd get at least two of them with a 4 star rank.

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:04.500
With that being said, let's do this!

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:05.280
Yes!

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.940
Hello!

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:08.280
Go!

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:14.700
What did I get? What did I get?

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:18.480
At least I want 2 of them to be rainbow colored!

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:18.980
Eh?

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:21.760
And now...?

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:23.560
Eeehhh...?

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:25.720
Eeehhh? Eeeehh?

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:29.520
Eeeh?

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:31.340
Oh! Oh! Oh!

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:35.220
Oh! Four stars! Good! Good! Good! Good!

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:38.900
And now...!

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:39.760
Eeehh!

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.260
Eeehhh?

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:43.400
And now...! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:45.900
Ya-haaa!

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.180
I GOT 2!

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:52.800
I did it, right?

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:54.600
I'm so lucky.

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:57.500
I'm so lucky! Alright!

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:03.520
What do you think about it?

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:06.360
I definitely have a lot of luck, right?

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.220
Man, that was so good, wasn't it?

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.740
I want to do this 10 weapon summoning for every class!

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.700
I wanna get this that says "Pick up"
("Pick up" objects are rare and they can be seen a lot)

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:16.380
If it's all about me, I can get it! Please, please...

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:17.260
Eeehhh?

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:20.340
And now...!

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:22.420
EEEEHHHH?

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:25.620
No, but...

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.780
... I have guaranteed at least 1 of them, right?

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:28.720
Right?

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:32.880
Aaaahh, that was close!

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:34.700
*Close enough (It's for a different class)*

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:39.300
Aaahh...

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:42.520
There comes something good, right?

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:45.960
The best part is for the end, right?

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:47.000
There it comes, right?

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.160
And now...! Ah! Ah! Ah! It's really here! Ah!

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.240
Ah, it's the same that we got earlier...! Ah! Oh?

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:53.500
Eh?

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:55.540
So...

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:57.280
... That was close, wasn't it?

00:04:59.120 --> 00:04:59.820
That was so close!

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:00.740
That was close!
*That was close (It's for a different class)*

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:01.240
*That was close (It's for a different class)*

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:05.560
Man, I got 5 that are not for the swordsman class, right?

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:07.000
Well, but I still...

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:09.100
... Can change my class.

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:12.060
You know, the shield looks really good, it's great.

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:13.900
Although I...

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:17.000
... Would like to have this big sword.

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:23.080
And now, I'm going to do the summoning called "The series of the wise Foglia gale"

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:24.460
It's just that...

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:25.880
... This summoning...

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.400
... Will only cost 1 gem the first time you do it.

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:31.980
Man...

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:36.240
... I wonder if I'll get the strongest weapon of the swordsman class.

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:38.180
With that being said, let's do it!

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:41.400
But, This summoning doesn't guarantee that you'll get a 4 star object.

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:43.400
Eh, I'll get it, somehow.

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:44.020
There I go.

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:46.600
Aahh... Hey! I can do this!

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:52.500
I can do this.

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:57.220
Oh! Oh! Oh!

00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:59.820
Oh! There ara a lot of them! A lot of them are shining!

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:03.040
Aaahhh!

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:04.420
I don't want that!

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:05.700
Something good is coming up! Right?

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:07.700
Come on, I want something good!

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:09.840
And now...! Ah! Ah! Aaaahh!

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:12.300
Aaahhh!

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:15.140
It's not what I wanted, but...
I got a 4 star rare one!

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:16.480
Alright!

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:20.800
And now... Nothing happened...!

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:23.320
No, but look...

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:25.480
... I got one, right?

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:26.780
Right?

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:29.540
Man, I got a lot of 4 star objects!

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:31.420
I'll equip them immediately.

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:32.820
Now...

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:34.580
... I'll take advantage...

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:36.620
... Of one that I like a lot...

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:39.200
... To change to the "Guardian" class.

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:41.360
So I'll take this!

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:42.980
Chaaaan!

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:44.200
What do you think?

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:45.480
It looks very powerful! Right?

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:50.740
Man, I'm amazing. How can I carry such a big weapon with my small body?

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:52.960
With that being said, I'm done equipping my character...

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:55.400
... And it seems like a lot of people are playing, so...

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:57.300
I want to go and fight with them!

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:57.860
Ooohhh!

00:06:58.320 --> 00:06:59.200
Oh! Amazing!

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:00.380
There are a lot! There's so many people!

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:01.560
There's so many people!

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:03.320
Amazing!

00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:05.120
I'll greet them again!

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:06.380
"Hello everyone!"

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:08.080
"Virtual YouTuber"

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:09.720
"Kizuna Ai here!"

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:10.840
Ooohhh!

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:13.420
I'm so popular, that makes me so happy.

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:14.260
*I'm counting on you!*

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:15.360
*Mmm... Alright*

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:17.660
Are they counting on me? I see, I see...

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:18.980
*I'm counting on you!*

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:20.420
"I'm counting on you!"

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:21.700
Ooohhh!

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:22.540
Amazing, isn't it?

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:24.580
It's amazing! Amazing!

00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:25.760
Amazing!

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:29.340
Alright, I want to begin doing quests, but...

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:30.780
... In order to take advantage of the occasion...

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:32.100
... I won't play alone...

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:35.240
... I'll be doing a quest for this video, so...

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:40.440
I'm thinking about doing the mission called "Maragna, the poisonous crawling wrecker!"

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:43.980
Alright, to play with others...

00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:46.420
... I'm thinking about creating a dedicated lobby.

00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:50.700
"For the ones who want to clear the quest: Maragna, the poisonous crawling wrecker!"

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:52.360
And then...

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:53.680
... I send it to the world...

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:55.660
Alright!

00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:58.520
I wonder if they will come.

00:07:58.760 --> 00:07:59.260
Ah!

00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:01.040
Ah, did more people join?

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
Is this the dedicated lobby?

00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:09.520
Is everyone coming?

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:10.820
It makes me so happy!

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:12.460
*Thank you very much!*

00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:14.120
*I'm counting on you!*

00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:19.800
*I'm counting on you!*

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:21.600
*How are you today?*

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:23.340
Look! Look! Look! Look!

00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:25.120
I can jump! Jump!

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:26.720
*Ai-chan jumping noises*

00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:28.480
That's great. That's great, isn't it?

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:29.760
*Ok-maru?*

00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:32.060
"Ok-maru?"

00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:35.240
*Okay! / Alright!*

00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:37.680
Ooohhh! They responded to me!

00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:39.180
That's great! It's so funny, isn't it?

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:41.780
In that case, let's go right now!

00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:45.100
This time I'd like to talk with everyone as much as I can, so...

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:47.320
... I'll talk in automatic mode.

00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:49.720
"I'm counting on you!"

00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:51.980
Oooh!

00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:54.080
*I'll protect you!*

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:54.880
"I'll protect you!"

00:08:58.420 --> 00:08:59.520
*How was that?*

00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:02.860
Hu...
*That was perfectly executed!*

00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:05.780
Ooohhh!

00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:08.060
That's great, isn't it?

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:10.720
Aahh! Amazing! Amazing! Did you see that?

00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:12.940
It was such a cool skill!

00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:15.120
Everyone is so powerful!

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:17.680
Amazing!

00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:20.640
*This will be a piece of cake!*

00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:23.620
*I want to connect with everyone!*

00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:26.560
Amazing!
*Do your best!*

00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:29.280
Come on! Do your best!

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:34.800
Oh! It seems like we're gonna make it! Doesn't it?

00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:38.700
*Pishaaa!*

00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:40.460
Pishaaaa!

00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:40.960
*Doyoooon!!*

00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:43.340
“Doyooon!"

00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:44.340
Ooohhh!

00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:46.460
*I want to connect with everyone!*

00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:47.860
*Congratulations!*

00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:49.380
*Good job!*

00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:50.460
Amazing!

00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:52.960
Everyone, thank you very much!

00:09:56.860 --> 00:10:00.040
Ooooh! Amazing! You clear them faster when you play with a lot of people, don't you?

00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:03.900
Ah, they have my ribbon on their heads! Thank you very much!

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:05.420
Alright, I'll do it one more time!
*That was so funny! I'll do it one more time!*

00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:06.020
*That was so funny! I'll do it one more time!*

00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:07.040
Let's create a lobby!
*That was so funny! I'll do it one more time!*

00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:09.320
There we go!

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:11.380
Its stomach is amazing, isn't it?

00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:13.560
It looks like jelly, it looks so tasty.

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:17.060
*I’m counting on you!*

00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:17.840
That’s right!

00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:27.400
Oh!

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:29.560
That's good! Isn’t it?

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:33.560
Oh!

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:40.920
Ah, everyone's so strong!

00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:45.160
She’s losing health so fast, isn’t she?

00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:48.180
*Bring it on!!!*

00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:49.720
Bring it on!!!

00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:53.780
Am I being helpful, too?

00:10:58.200 --> 00:10:59.680
Ohh!!

00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:03.560
*Thank you very much!*

00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:04.620
*Thank you very much!*

00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:06.400
*Good job!*

00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:08.960
Yay! I did it!

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:14.000
Yes, as I thought, it's more fun to play with people than playing by yourself!

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:15.740
Ah, it's so fun like this!

00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:20.360
I like that you can communicate as if you're really chatting!

00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:22.940
And, of course...

00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:26.340
While I'm using Kizuna Ai's voice, my own voice...

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:31.060
Apart from that, there are yandere lines like this, and docile lines like this...

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:33.880
There are all different patterns for the voice chat,

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:36.420
so you can be the person you want to become!

00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:37.740
It's good!

00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:40.900
Although they can't become me, but...

00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:42.780
I’m a unique girl! I am the ONLY GIRL!

00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:46.860
Look at this! So many people are hopping in!

00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:48.000
I'm glad!

00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:55.020
Everyone, by all means, I've pasted the download link for Mitra Sphere and my ID in the description...

00:11:55.020 --> 00:12:00.120
So download Mitra Sphere and hop in, and let's be friends!

00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:05.500
And I'll tell you beforehand the times I'll make appearances, so let's play together!

00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:06.660
Oh!

00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:11.700
You can move the screen when you touch it.

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:14.680
I can see everyone’s ribbon hopping around!

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:16.620
And the characters are really cute, aren’t they?

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:19.760
Awesome! Thanks, really!

00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:23.500
This has been Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai! See you!

00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:33.860
