00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:07.180
Hey everyone. Man, I'm so nervous and also excited for what I'm about to share with you

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:10.140
It's a really important time for us here at Wong Fu Productions

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:12.940
and I just really want to be transparent and

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:19.540
Honest with you all and let you know where we're at, where we're trying to go and what that means for our biggest fans and supporters.

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:25.600
Today we're launching a Patreon page. We've been thinking about it for a while, but we thought that now was the right time.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:30.660
Now don't freak out, this doesn't mean that people are going to have to pay to watch our videos nor does it mean that Wong Fu is in trouble

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.940
We're only doing this to enable us to do more than what we normally do here on this channel

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.340
So, nothing's going to change about the way you watch Wong Fu, if anything things are only going to get better.

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.260
If you're wondering what Patreon is, I'll get into that a little bit later

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.780
But for now let me give you a little bit of context.

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.940
This year we will reach the 15 year anniversary of Wong Fu Productions. We've been doing this a very long time

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:55.678
We've seen the YouTube and digital space overall change immensely over the years

00:00:55.679 --> 00:00:57.899
and we've done our best to keep up with the industry and

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.240
with our fans.

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:04.280
Well with so many channels trying to shock and clickbait their way to views and with so many traditional celebrities making the

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.660
Jump over, channels like us who create original scripted videos are few and far between and honestly

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:15.660
We're kind of being pushed out. So now more than ever the power is in our fans to keep us going and growing

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:20.819
With all these changes happening in our world, fans and peers have been asking what's next for us.

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:26.700
A show off YouTube? Maybe Netflix or TV? Some people are even saying we should sell part of our company to investors.

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:32.420
These will all seem like very possible and natural next steps, but let's break each down really quick

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:33.780
So first, investors.

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:38.400
Now it's kind of crazy, but people have actually wanted to invest in Wong Fu, but for where we are right now

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.400
We've actually declined these offers because we knew that it would drastically change our content and the way we make it.

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.240
We'd have to transform into one of those channels

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.400
that have to like pump out a hundred videos a month or something crazy like that.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:49.800
Sure it would be a great paycheck

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.129
But ultimately it would compromise the quality and integrity of the work

00:01:53.129 --> 00:01:56.040
We do here at Wong Fu, and we just don't want to operate like that.

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.120
Now let's talk about TV and Netflix

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:03.700
while we would love to be able to tell our fans that we have a new show coming to Netflix or ABC this fall,

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:10.680
the truth is, for creators like us reaching a deal and developing a project with those platforms requires a multitude of variables

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.040
dozens of people that all have input and a lot of time.

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.200
You probably wouldn't even see something from Wong Fu for like over a year

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.340
And that's just not something that we'd be okay with.

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.520
In fact last year I actually went down that road pitching a show to big studios

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:27.340
It's a long, tough process with a lot of waiting.

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.220
Even when we did have our own big show, Single by 30

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:31.330
It was on YouTube red

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:37.209
Which meant a lot of our fans couldn't even watch it and even when we wanted to continue it YouTube decided against the second season.

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.489
We had no control over our own idea

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.979
We're not gonna wait for a studio or network to allow us to make a show to put our faces on screen

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:47.360
So we're just gonna have to make one ourselves

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.409
In fact, we don't just want to make one show, we want to make many shows

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:55.420
But the reality is, to make high-quality content you need money, so let's talk about that

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.560
We've never talked about this before, but there are actually about four main ways that Wong Fu generates revenue

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.720
Which all ultimately go towards making our videos.

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:08.949
The one that you're most familiar with is YouTube ads. Now a lot of channels can say that this is their main source of revenue

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:13.449
But because we're not some super popular daily vlogger with millions of views a day

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:18.300
we actually make very little from ads, so this has never been our main source of income.

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:21.640
The second way is through brand integrations and sponsorships.

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.359
Companies will pay us to make content that features their product in a natural way

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:31.280
And we actually really enjoy working with cool brands, but ultimately we're creating content for the company and not completely ourselves.

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:39.220
Number three is merchandise! if you've ever bought a t-shirt or something from our Wong Fu online store, that goes directly to supporting this channel

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.520
And finally, events and screenings.

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:44.700
Every so often we'll have a screening event or we are invited to speak at a university

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:49.060
And we'll sell tickets or we are paid a fee, and maybe we've seen some of you guys there

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.939
So that's how Wong Fu makes money and funds this channel

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:56.259
I think a lot of people might think that Wong Fu is like this really big company with a ton of money

00:03:56.359 --> 00:03:58.010
But don't let those articles

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:00.360
About millionaire Youtubers misinform you

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:05.079
We typically work on micro budgets and save whatever we can so that we can put more money back

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:08.440
Into our own passion projects and the people who make them

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:09.698
Now that you know our entire situation

00:04:09.889 --> 00:04:13.899
And our thought process the question is, if we want to do more and create more

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:20.320
But not rely on those four revenue streams or the slow studio system or investors, what can we do?

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:23.169
Well, here's our solution

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:25.300
We're starting a Patreon page

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.340
And we're calling it Wong Fu Forward

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:33.100
Wong Fu Forward is an extension of what we already do here at Wong Fu and will include a variety of initiatives and goals that

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:37.059
Will be free from corporations and brands. And in order to take on these new goals

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:40.479
We're reaching out to you, the fans and supporters, to give you the option to

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:42.680
Participate in this next phase of Wong Fu.

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:44.619
For those of you who aren't familiar with Patreon

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:50.439
It's a platform that allows people to pay a monthly membership in exchange for special perks and gifts

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:54.459
We know this is not for everyone and that's totally okay. This is just for those of you

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:57.699
Who are more invested in what we're trying to do here at Wong Fu, and all it's going to

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:00.980
Cost is as much as a coffee or a boba drink a month

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:05.400
Now to be totally clear, we are not using Patreon to just keep Wong Fu running as normal.

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:07.410
We're not asking for money to do more of the same

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:11.560
This is to enable us to take on new ventures in addition to what we already do

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:17.949
So what are some of these ventures? Well, our main goals are funding brand new series that are bigger than what we normally can do

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:21.010
Most of our channel as you can see are just sketches

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:27.189
But we want to make more series like Just Another Nice Guy or turn sketch ideas into full-on series, like Asian Bachelorette

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:30.159
We also want to co-develop and produce pilots with other creators.

00:05:30.199 --> 00:05:34.929
This money will be shared as we help other Youtubers, directors, writers all tell their stories.

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:38.320
Speaking of developing, we also want to help foster new talent.

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:42.480
Searching for aspiring Youtubers or filmmakers or actors and musicians

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:45.280
Who need a little help getting their first project off the ground.

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:48.280
We want to reach back to help bring up the next generation

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:53.620
Which is why we also want to start doing community outreach programs, like at high schools and middle schools, doing workshops

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:57.740
Teaching students about the possibilities of digital media and the arts

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:03.280
All this for just $5 a month. And in exchange, members will get access to videos early

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:09.640
Exclusive live streams where we brainstorm together, invitations to events when we're in your city and discounts at our store.

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:13.400
You'll become part of our development process as we achieve these goals together.

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:16.659
So to anyone who's worried or sceptical, do not worry

00:06:16.659 --> 00:06:18.879
We are not charging you to watch our videos

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:24.279
We are not changing our channel. If you're just a casual fan, and you can't pay it's all good

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:28.200
You can still enjoy Wong Fu the same way you have been for all these years

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:35.100
Wong Fu Forward is just for the small percentage of our supporters who want to contribute and be more involved in our process and our mission.

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:39.540
This is only for those who have the means to give and we are in no way looking down on those who can't.

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:45.900
We've just gotten so many comments from fans throughout the years asking us how they can help beyond buying a ticket or t-shirt here and there.

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:47.980
Well, this is how!

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:51.840
The last time we reached out to fans for direct support was four years ago for our movie

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:54.189
It was incredible to see so much enthusiasm

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:57.430
And we actually learned a lot about how best to handle campaigns like this

00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:02.769
And we can't wait to work with you guys again. Like I said before, this year is our 15th anniversary

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:06.460
And as much as we've accomplished over a decade and a half, sometimes

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:08.660
I feel like we've just begun

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:13.180
We want to continue making an impact on people and creators in the Asian-American community

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:16.210
Which actually still has a long way to go in mainstream media.

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:21.500
Help us to continue to fight for representation in Hollywood and for quality content on YouTube.

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:24.740
Help us to do even more with our reach and our work.

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:31.900
