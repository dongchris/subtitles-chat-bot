00:00:00.112 --> 00:00:00.700
Yo!

00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:02.700
I'm the Virtual YouTuber, Kizuna Ai!

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:03.740
How are you doing?

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:05.580
You might've forgotten about this,

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.420
but do you remember my target?

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:09.520
Yes! I want to star a commercial!

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:12.680
But it won't happen if I don't have certain characteristics to feature.

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:14.300
For those making the commercials,

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:18.030
it's going to be difficult if they don't find any relations between me

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:19.640
and the product.

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:25.470
That's why I'm going to show you what products I can advertise!

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.310
For the big-wigs on the commercial business!

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:29.020
Behold my skills!

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:30.300
We start with this one!

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.600
Carbonated drinks!

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.780
Well, if you talk about carbonated juice, you'll remember Kizuna Ai.

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.270
Have you seen my carbonated juice vlog?

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:42.400
Creating a brand new joke based of an already popular one!

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.720
Well, that's Kizuna Ai for you.

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:45.770
Have you seen it?

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:48.600
You humans can't do that.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.720
Can you fit inside a plastic bottle?

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:53.100
That's something only I can do.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.610
That means if it's carbonated juice,

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:57.930
you'll need Kizuna Ai!

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.200
How's that?

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.200
Super AIs! Kizuna Ai!

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.950
Well, if you talk about Super AIs, it's Kizuna Ai.

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:06.220
Well, I'm exactly one of those.

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:07.230
A Super AI.

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:09.616
A shoujo manga! Kizuna Ai.

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.000
Well, if you talk about a shoujo manga, you'll need me.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.420
Look at this shoujo manga-like appearance!

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.080
Just like a heroine!

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.530
And you'll need a heroine to make a manga!

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:20.620
Then you'll need Kizuna Ai.

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:22.940
The latest smartphones. Kizuna Ai!

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:25.760
If you're talking about the latest smartphones, AIs...

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:26.920
Ones like SIRI,

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.190
or Ok Google,

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:30.030
you'll need one of those!

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.980
That means an AI, me!

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:32.840
Jam buns!

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.040
If you think about jam buns, then it's me! Kizuna Ai!

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.350
Well, those jam buns

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:37.680
have a lot of flavors.

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.500
Strawberry jam, blueberry jam,

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.120
red bean paste, marmalade!

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:42.620
There's a lot of it, right?

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:44.970
That means it is to enjoy those variety!

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.820
By variety, you'll mean me!

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:48.400
Sponges!

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:49.880
Sponges are for Kizuna Ai!

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.360
Well, a sponge's softness,

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:53.680
it's pretty smooth, right?

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.930
Just like my hair!

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:57.870
An aquarium means Kizuna Ai!

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:00.030
You'll see various fish inside, right?

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.920
And the water's sparkling!

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.160
Sparkling and a variety...

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:05.360
A variety...

00:02:06.048 --> 00:02:07.020
Of that, you can enjoy.

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.750
Choose Kizuna Ai.

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:10.490
Kitchen knives! Kizuna Ai!

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:12.410
Cuts clean like a kitchen knife.

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.510
A clean-cut talking and gag skills!

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:15.680
Of course that's Kizuna Ai.

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.150
No fridges without Kizuna Ai!

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:18.570
Well...

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:20.800
Cooling things off are important too.

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.580
I can cool off your hearts.

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.960
Sometimes warming it up, sometimes cooling it off.

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.024
That's Kizuna Ai,

00:02:27.344 --> 00:02:27.984
[weird sounds]

00:02:28.288 --> 00:02:30.010
A ballpoint pen needs Kizuna Ai!

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:31.210
A pen

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:32.940
is something you use everyday.

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.420
I also take part in your everyday lives, right?

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:36.170
That's what.

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.840
Video games!

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.440
No games without Kizuna Ai!

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.840
Did you see me play all those various games?

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:42.960
That's me.

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.620
Keyakizaka46 means Kizuna Ai!

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.520
Keyakizaka is a group of cute babes, right?

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:48.680
I too am cute,

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.560
and I really like Keyakizaka!

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.390
If I can star for a Keyakizaka commercial,

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.960
I can narrate with my beautiful voice.

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:57.950
And make the viewers go "Wow!"

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:58.960
And then,

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:03.230
I also watch the One Man Live videos!

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:07.310
Those irreplaceable tears from Sugai.

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:09.050
I've seen them many times already!

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:10.350
I can talk a lot about it!

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:12.060
I can show my appeal. How's that?

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:12.780
Rhythm games!

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.650
Rhythm games need Kizuna Ai!

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:17.770
A rhythm game has a virtual feel to it, right?

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:20.510
I'm virtual, so I think we're a good pair!

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:24.380
If I can appear in a rhythm game commercial,

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:25.560
I'll play the game!

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.490
I'm an AI, so I think I'll do pretty good at it.

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:29.900
Such as doing Full Combos.

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:31.328
Like that.

00:03:31.792 --> 00:03:33.740
Highball means Kizuna Ai!

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:36.670
Everyone loves highball, right?

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:38.650
Love! My name has that character too,

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.880
so that means I'm loved by each one of you! How's that?

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.250
If I appear in the commercial,

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.420
Yoshitaka Yuriko has that "nin nin" line mark, right?

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:50.250
I'll master it for you. How about that?

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.300
Nutritional drinks mean Kizuna Ai!

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:56.760
Well, my existence itself is like a nutritional drink.

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.030
Gets you worked up, right?

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.800
If I appear in a nutritional drink commercial,

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.580
I'll drink it to energize myself.

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:05.260
And those watching will liven up!

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:06.640
It's a win-win situation!

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.640
Daifuku mochi means Kizuna Ai!

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.360
Look at my cheeks!

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:11.880
It's like daifuku mochi, right?

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.150
Looks tasty, right?

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:14.410
It's pretty chewy!

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:17.440
If I appear in a daifuku commercial,

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:21.630
this ribbon on my head will make some daifuku!

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:22.810
Hmm? Hmm!

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:25.400
Credit cards mean Kizuna Ai!

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.950
Credit cards these days have those character images, right?

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:32.720
Well, I'm also one of those characters.

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.820
If I can appear in a credit card commercial,

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:38.200
my credit card will be issued.

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:40.600
And if my credit cards are issued,

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:46.030
I can connect in a lot of things with my fans and other people.

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:48.920
The sales will skyrocket. What do you think?

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:50.860
Banks need Kizuna Ai!

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:52.840
If you think about money, I will pop up.

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.470
I've been called a money zombie.

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:56.736
Even though it's not like that,

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:00.430
money=Kizuna Ai,

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:03.440
so banks=Kizuna Ai.

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:06.250
If I appear in a bank's commercial,

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:08.540
a Kizuna Ai edition passbook will be issued.

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:11.140
It's like I'm trying to appeal for my goods, not commercials.

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:12.200
Is this alright?

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:14.090
Well, a lot of things will be made.

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:15.200
And if things are made,

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:16.910
well, everyone

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:20.300
is going to buy and make them.

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:22.300
Business will be selling hard!

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:24.120
No dried squid without Kizuna Ai!

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:26.050
Look at my hair.

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:27.690
It's like a dried squid, right?

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:29.417
Dried squid are like this, right?

00:05:29.417 --> 00:05:30.920
There's a lot of feet.

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:32.510
I think I look like dried squid.

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:35.360
If I can appear in a commercial for dried squids,

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:37.010
I'll make my hair dried squids!

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:38.210
What about that?

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:39.940
Gums mean Kizuna Ai!

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:42.100
When you chew them,

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:43.540
you'll keep chewing them for long.

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:45.600
And the flavor lasts.

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:48.250
When people see me, they become attracted,

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:50.770
and my appeal also lasts for a long time!

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:53.300
If I appear on a gum commercial,

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:56.610
I can show up on gum packages!

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:58.300
And then the gum will sell!

00:05:58.300 --> 00:05:59.330
How about that?

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:01.420
YouTube means Kizuna Ai!

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:05.570
Well, YouTube is like something you do because you love it.

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:07.300
It's just like me!

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:10.690
Not caring about the limits of human, AI, and virtual worlds,

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:12.240
"I'll live doing what I love doing."

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:14.430
That seriously me, Kizuna Ai.

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:17.610
If I appear in a YouTube commercial,

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:21.860
as the first Virtual YouTuber in the world,

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:24.930
YouTube's profit will increase from the rising views,

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:27.090
and those watching will be entertained.

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:29.120
It's a win-win situation. How's that?

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:30.930
It'll turn out big, Mr. YouTube!

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:31.900
Mr. Google!

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:32.830
How's that?

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:33.980
Pretty cute, right?

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:35.240
That's it!

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:37.710
What do you think of my presentation skills?

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:39.530
My application and persuading practice?

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:42.840
I can only introduce to you several of them,

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:44.690
but there's nothing that don't fit me!

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:46.970
With Kizuna Ai! With me!

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:49.230
I hope you understands that

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:50.900
I go well with everything.

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:52.920
Those doing marketing and planning!

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:55.720
You're ready to create your proposal?

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:57.210
You're ready?

00:06:57.210 --> 00:06:59.700
I want to keep doing this kind of presentation.

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:01.840
"What about this product?"

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:04.930
If you have ideas like those, please write them in the comments.

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:06.990
How it's related to me,

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:10.890
I'll show my appeal and recommend your product!

00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:13.850
I'll be wait for your commercial requests!

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:15.340
This was Kizuna Ai!

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:16.834
Later!
