00:00:00.445 --> 00:00:01.445
*peek*

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:04.000
*APPEAR*

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:07.380
Hiya! It's Virtual Youtuber Kizuna Ai!

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:10.600
Everyone! I've kept you waiting!

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:12.100
Guess what!

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.720
My very own, Kizuna Ai visual novel

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:18.680
is coming out!

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:20.980
It really gives you a feel for how far we've come.

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:22.860
We're still developing it,

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:25.120
it's currently in beta testing, but

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.440
Don't you want a sneak peek?

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.680
You want one, don't you!

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.020
Let's give it a shot then!

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:43.700
「You're so late!!!!!!」

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.220
「I can't believe you made me, THE Kizuna Ai wait TWO WHOLE hours!」

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:50.380
You made her wait 2 entire hours?

00:00:50.425 --> 00:00:51.425
That's horrible.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.700
「I was so bored I thought up 2 weeks worth of videos!」

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.340
Thinking up two weeks worth, that's what you expect from a super intelligent AI.

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:00.520
On the ball there.

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.700
This choice...
(1. I was thinking up a plan for our date)
(2. I slept in)

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.260
Saying I slept in would be a little too honest, right?

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:10.240
Um, I mean,

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.000
Like, she's been waiting for 2 hours and you just slept in?

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.260
So I'll pick the 'date planning' one.

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:18.640
I mean that's a huge lie but...

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.680
Like, make her think, 'Oh, they were thinking about me'.

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:24.780
Really shouldn't have been late in the first place though.

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.800
Let's pick this one.

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.340
「You're being truthful, right?」

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.140
「Fine, but I'm counting on your navigation skills, Goggle Maps-san!」
Leave it to me~

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:36.660
I left you waiting, after all.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.000
It'll be a piece of cake!

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.880
「This had better not be some sort of date plan pulled straight out of a magazine!」

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.340
Everything sounds so annoying when it's just me talking to myself haha

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:47.900
「I've already seen all of those, so it better not be!」

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.600
Ah~ I'm screwed. As expected of me, I know exactly what I'm gonna do.

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:57.020
「As expected of an adult! Handing over the cash with a smile!」

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.680
「I wanted this to use for Youtube~」

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.060
「Thanksies♪」

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.840
Oh this girl's got nerve.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.640
Girls like these just eat men up.

00:02:09.135 --> 00:02:10.465
Eat? Exploit?

00:02:10.845 --> 00:02:11.925
Definitely not 'eat'.

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.180
They'll 'exploit' men.

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.540
I won't be tricked!

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.560
I won't be tricked. (repeat)

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.380
「Well then, where shall we go next?」

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.480
Next up... how about my house?
(1. How about a cafe?)
(2. How about my house?)

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.220
「eh...」

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.780
「I dunno, that sounds like something out of a mid-day FujiTV show...」

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.400
Wai, wai, wait up. Whaddya mean mid-day show gurlー
「I dunno, that sounds like something out of a mid-day FujiTV show...」

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:38.800
「I mean, that's fine, I guess...」

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.220
IT'S ACTUALLY FINE?!

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:43.275
「But! If you try anything even slightly suspicious,」

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.220
「"DRY ICE BOMB + GRAVEL = DEAD PEOPLE!?!?!?!?"」

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.700
「I'll force you to act for a video with that title!」

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.500
Ah, she's uh, properly

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.660
Making sure she's got something to tell the cops.

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:55.300
There it is.

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.900
You're definitely going all the way. I mean, if you really didn't want to, you wouldn't go to their house!

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.140
You're going to their house, pretending to resist... What a wh*re.

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.160
「Wow~~~」

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:11.060
「There's so much manga! This is definitely a guy's room!」

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.600
「Do you have anything interesting lying around? Where are your Keyakioka DVDs?」

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.720
「Can I search under your bed?」

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:19.820
Under the bed?

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.460
How about no? There things you don't need to see there.
(1. You can't)
(2. Commentate the baseball for me)

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.300
「Figuresー Looking under a boy's bed is taboo after all~」

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:31.760
Well, look at that, you know your stuff.

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.980
「That won't stop me from actually looking under it though, idiot!」

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:36.240
IDIOT?!

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.140
WELL YOU'RE AN IDIOT TOO!

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:45.380
Wait, actually forget that one. I just insulted myself then.

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:48.020
I'm not an idiot. I'm a super AI.

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:49.720
「DIVE!」

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.500
「I'M INNNNNNNN」

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:55.180
Ah, these photos...

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:56.200
Well...

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.280
I mean, I'm really cute, so...
「How about you explain why you have all of these images?」

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.800
「How about you explain why you have all of these images?」

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:04.460
So yeah, you just kinda want to collect them...
「How about you explain why you have all of these images?」

00:04:04.845 --> 00:04:05.965
「Who...」

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:07.640
「might this be?」

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:11.080
Uh... My waifu, yeah.
(1. The one and only Kizuna Ai)
(2. My waifu)

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:13.280
Well, she is the one and only Kizuna Ai, but she's also my waifu.

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:14.820
「Thank you very much.」
Well, she is the one and only Kizuna Ai, but she's also my waifu.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.400
「There are others who say the same thing, all over the world.」

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.960
Eh? Why do you have to be attracted to me?!
「There are others who say the same thing, all over the world.」

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:24.940
「...I can't just ignore it like Seri-senpai though, so I'm just gonna tell it to you straight.」

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.660
「Are you ready? You'd better listen.」

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:29.940
「That's fucking disgusting.」

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:32.800
Why the heck am I calling myself disgusting?! That's so rude!
「That's fucking disgusting.」

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:35.700
That just backfires on you, y'know! Do you understand?!

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:38.220
Try a little harder like Seri-senpai~

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:40.080
Let me explain!
(1. Figuresー)
(2. Let me explain!)

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:44.040
「Eh? Eh!? W-Wait!」

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:47.240
「W-Wait, hang on!」

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:50.500
「Wait, you're way too close! Too close I said!」

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:51.200
I'm coming for you!

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:53.440
「What is it!? What do you want from me!?」

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:55.580
「I'll seriously get angry if you...!」

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:56.080
You'll get angry!?

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:57.960
「I'll block you in real life!」

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:00.920
「I'll ban you from my life!」

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:04.060
If you ban me from my own life I'll disappear!

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:07.695
Like a self ban. I'll just disappear.
(1. Let me explain)
(2. literally just kiss her)

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:09.120
'Literally just kiss her'?

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:10.860
Who the hell thought up these choices?

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:15.140
Listen to me Ai! You're the only thing I have left!

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:16.600
「...」

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:18.800
「I-I'm listening, so!」

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:21.980
「W-What is it!?」

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:24.140
I always loved you.
「1. I always loved you」

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:27.280
Marry m- Have my babies!

00:05:27.995 --> 00:05:30.795
And make me miso soup every morning!

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:31.960
Virtual soup.

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:36.300
How would you make babies in this virtual format?

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:38.780
Do I just like, *BLEGH* the eggs out of my mouth?

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:40.120
That sounded so wrong...

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:48.820
「I-I mean, even if you suddenly say something like that...」

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:57.680
「Thank you...」

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:00.880
「I'm, glad.」

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:05.840
Eh!? That's where it ends?

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:09.800
Eh? But I'm so interested! I want to know what happens next!

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:10.740
Will they be turned down?

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:14.380
Or will my waifu get married after all?!

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:17.180
I... Me... It doesn't matter what I say, it'll always backfire.

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:18.480
How did you like it, everyone?

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:20.720
Aren't you interested in what happens next?

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:25.520
As expected of me, I'm so cute you'll just forgive me no matter what I say!

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:26.820
You love being called 'disgusting', right?

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:28.380
We have to do this one.

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:30.000
Look forward to it, everyone!
