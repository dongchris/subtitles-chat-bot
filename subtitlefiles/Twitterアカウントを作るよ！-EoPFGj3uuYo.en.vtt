Virtual Youtuber,
Kizuna Ai here!

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:04.540
So for today, we'll do this:

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:06.220
"Making a twitter account!"

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.220
Why am I making a twitter account if you ask me,

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.160
I was wondering what's good for 
promoting my contents,

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.100
and what's good for connecting with people,

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.860
and thus,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.620
I asked Google about it.

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:17.140
Okay, so let's go straight away

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:19.060
and make the twitter account!

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:19.820
There!

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:21.720
Ho?

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:24.620
I don't have phone number...

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:25.620
Skip!

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:27.700
I decided on my username you know!

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:29.980
I need to make it easy to remember, right?

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:32.020
Using my own name is normal thing right?

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:33.340
Ki..

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:33.940
zu..

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:34.440
na!

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.640
and let's use underscore here..

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:38.880
Ai!

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:40.460
"Next"!

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:42.000
Hmm?

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:42.920
"Next"!

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:45.180
"Next.."

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:48.340
This username is

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.320
already taken by someone else.

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.160
Who in the world used my name?

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.280
So we have no choice but to change it!

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:57.780
Ai!

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:58.360
Kizuna!

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:02.300
Who used this one too?!

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:03.700
So...

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.180
What should I use...

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:05.840
Ah

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:07.180
Let's make it cute like

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:08.280
Ai...

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:09.300
chan?

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:11.360
Is this taken too?

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:12.120
Ai..

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:13.200
underscore...

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:14.540
chan...

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:15.380
Hmmp!

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:17.300
underscore!

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.880
See, it's already used too!

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.480
What should I use for username?
Hurry up and make one, me!

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.020
Kizuna..

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.660
Ai!

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:25.320
Look,

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.400
"Simple is best."

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.900
"Oh my god..."

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:39.660
[Contemplating on Username]

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:40.820
This is..

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:42.600
has turned into a difficult situation.

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:43.580
Uhm,

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:45.520
can't let this make me down, right?

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.260
I'll go ahead and make my twitter later, okay?

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:51.980
So, you should totally follow me on twitter, okay?!

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.960
Okay!

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.920
