00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.220
Ah...

00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:03.080
Heave-ho...

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.500
Hi!

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:09.540
I'm Virtual Youtuber Kizuna AI!

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:13.840
Recently, "being a YouTuber" ranked among the occupations that elementary students were interested in

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:16.180
and it became a topic of discussion.

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.560
That ranking was based on the result of a questionnaire survey for fourth graders at a certain elementary school in Osaka prefecture.

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:23.940
But, being a YouTuber is hard work.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.300
Shooting and editing videos takes time,

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:31.000
when watching the videos you thought interesting later, sometimes they turn out terrible.

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:35.060
It's tough and hard work, not a picnic.

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:37.660
I think that no matter what kind of work it is, it is not easy.

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.720
It is also tough for me and I have no budget.

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:47.500
If this situation continues, I might have to leave YouTube and post the videos on DMM (adult site).

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:48.860
Oh my gosh...

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:52.380
A.I.Channel faces a crisis of survival.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:57.320
I want to continue YouTuber forever, I will start this from today!

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.280
Virtual Girl's Prize-Winning Life!

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.400
Yay!

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.020
I looked for prizes and lottery events right away.

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:07.240
This is for today.

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.480
New Baby Star's New character Naming campaign.

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:13.120
The character of the Baby Star Crispy Noodle Snack has been revamped,

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.980
and they're looking for someone to name the new character.

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.640
One winner is chosen from the list of names

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.620
and will win 1 million yen worth of pure gold!

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:23.780
1 million yen.

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.760
Additionally, 100 people will receive one year's worth of Baby Star Crispy Noodle Snacks!

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.840
You wouldn't have to worry about food for a year.

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:30.320
I must do it.

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.360
I'm seriously going to apply.

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.300
Their website is here.

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:35.420
It has a pop-art style.

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.100
A new character is shown on the pure gold of the grand prize.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:44.360
I may be able to sell this to an enthusiastic fan for over 1 million yen.

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:45.500
At Yahoo auction and so on.

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.540
He is likely to sing rap, isn't he?

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:49.900
When I saw this, I was reminded of something.

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.660
Everyone, please look.

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.320
The former characters are Bei-chan (Bay-chan) and Bih-chan (Bee-chan).

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.640
That means...

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.800
Because his beanie has stars,

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.720
I think he will get a name like "star".

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:03.780
How's my intuition?

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.860
A pure name like Star-kun or Star-chan.

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:12.760
If I suggest Star-chan or Star-kun wilI I be disqualified?

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.480
It's going to be pretty difficult.

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.100
Because "chan" has been used before,

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.080
they might use "chan" again

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.160
or they might use "kun" unexpectedly

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.800
It'll definitely have something to do with Baby Star

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:23.360
If that's the case

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:28.880
It could be Bihsutah, Stah (Star), Bisuta, or something like that

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:34.320
Only one person will be selected by lottery from the people who suggested names?

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:35.380
For the Double Chance,

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:38.560
100 people will be elected by lottery from the people who suggested names

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:39.620
Does that mean,

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.680
the safe choice will be picked?

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.020
Do you think that 101 people give the same strange name?

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:47.720
Am I a good detective?

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:49.740
Hmm, well...

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.900
I've decided!

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.020
Just kidding, please wait a little.

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:56.400
I've got an idea

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.040
The reason why I'm so troubled is because I really want that 1 million yen.

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.180
What kind of name would fit?

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.200
I really want this (desperately)

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.100
Well, you know, there is 1 million yen within arm's reach.

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:12.300
Besides, it's not luck or the lottery that matters, it's the decision that you make

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:13.440
Hmm...

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.700
Bei-chan, Bih-chan, Bebih-Sutah (Baby Star).

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:18.580
Ah! The initial of "Bei" is "B" ?

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:20.260
I think that "Suta" should be in it.

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.620
I think that "Suta" should be in it.

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.920
If I named him like I named Twin Teruko

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:29.100
His most noteworthy feature is the long torso.

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:30.800
Everyone, do you understand?

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:31.980
His long torso.

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:33.700
I think it is very important.

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.040
But I want to put "Suta" in his name.

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.100
Hmm, well...

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.180
I narrowed down the plan to two.

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.480
I think Suta is an innocuous name.

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:43.980
Suta.

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:46.660
I think it should be Suta-kun or Suta-chan

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:47.500
However,

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:53.820
I guess that Long-torso Suta-kun could be a long shot

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:54.740
Because his torso is long.

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:58.320
When a characteristic is included in the name,

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:00.460
it is impressive and memorable, isn't it?

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:01.180
I've decided.

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:03.780
I name him...

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:05.740
Suta-kun!

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:07.540
This isn't that funny as a video,

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:10.580
and I know this isn't what everybody wants.

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.440
But I am a fledgling YouTuber

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.720
and you can do anything if you have money, right?

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:22.040
So if I do this, everyone can enjoy my later videos, right?

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:24.040
Let's put "Suta-kun!"

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.540
Let's do that!

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:25.380
No objections, right?

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:26.740
Please, nobody else apply with Suta-kun, alright?

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:27.700
I want 1 million yen.

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.460
I will apply for this for now.

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.420
Please help me get 1 million yen.

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:33.840
I will apply for this for now.

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:34.380
Ah.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.140
I think winning 1 million yen is more important than have affection for the name.

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:42.360
I wonder if this will be the reason for winning

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:45.180
Like if they thought, "Ah, this person put a lot of thought behind this"

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:47.980
I think that this character is feeling the pressure.

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:52.880
He wants to be a star like his predecessors Bei-chan and Bii-chan.

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:55.100
He must have thought like that. However,

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.760
Calling him "Long-torso Suta" would be pretty brazen

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.860
That's why I'm calling "Suta-kun" instead

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:02.960
There is no doubt that the 1 million yen will be mine.

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:06.040
By the way, entries close on January 9

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.880
and it seems that the results will be announced on January 31

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:12.100
Would you like to think of a name for him and apply too?

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:12.600
Ah.

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:14.060
Please don't use "Suta".

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:15.980
I really want this, please support me.

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:20.620
Even though there will be more competition, I'd be happy if he gets a good name.

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:22.340
What a nice girl I am!

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:23.420
OK, next.

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:24.820
Next up!

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:26.440
Ta-dah.

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:28.860
MITRASPHERE

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:31.480
Scheduled to start service from Spring 2017

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:34.300
This is a smartphone game,

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:38.660
in this game the girls are cute, and it looks fun.

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:39.500
Please have a look at it

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:42.060
Pre-registration Triple Campaign

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:45.420
1. Receive luxurious benefits in the game.

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:47.200
Well, this is common, isn't it?

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:50.340
The number of gifts will increase according to the number of pre-registrants

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:54.000
It seem to go up to 100,000 people.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:54.940
Then,

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:58.060
the important thing is this!

00:05:58.060 --> 00:05:59.080
Ta-dah!

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:01.500
Triple Campaign 2!

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:04.180
Gifts for a total of up to 1 million yen!

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:10.740
Luxurious goods will be awarded to 50 people by lottery among the pre-registrants.

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:15.780
Although the odds are low, please look at these deluxe items.

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:18.800
Is this the most expensive one?

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.540
Playstation 4 VR camera

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:24.780
The total price of this item is around 100,000 yen.

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:26.220
I can't use it,

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:28.240
but I could sell it for some cash.

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:29.500
What do you think?

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:34.560
Restaurants, Matsusaka beef and red king crab may be difficult, seeing as I'm virtual.

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:38.660
But the gift code could be used for a billing system.

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:40.020
Good, good.

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:41.800
However, there is one drawback.

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:43.720
Goods can not be chosen.

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:46.040
Though I think luck is necessary,

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:50.200
I can do it for free, so I should register anyway

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:52.440
Then, Triple Campaign 3.

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:54.860
Original item present.

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:56.680
It is a small and cute character, isn't it?

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:57.260
Wings.

00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:59.500
I want wings on my head too!

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:00.580
How is it?

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:03.840
By the way, entries will close once the game is released

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:07.420
Everyone, let's pre-register early.

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:15.060
Pre-registration can be done by e-mail, Twitter, LINE, YouTube, so please choose your preferred method.

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:16.920
Please let me know if you win.

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:20.220
And if you feel like it, you can give me the prize.

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:24.940
Everyone, if you find a great prize or campaign, please let me know by all means.

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:30.780
By the way, the things I explained this time are listed in the description section of the video, so please check and apply.

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:34.400
This was Virtual Girl's Prize-Winning Life!

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:35.400
Bye bye!
