00:00:03.549 --> 00:00:07.319
Hey everyone! Wes here. You know what they don't tell you about growing up?

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:10.019
Okay, sure there's a lot of things, but one

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:19.000
especially heartbreaking fact is that summer break stops existing once you're done with school. *whispers* poof, gone forever.

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:20.710
I miss summer break.

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:22.800
It was one of the best parts about being a kid

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:28.349
It was more than just three months between every school year. It was a magical window of time for freedom,

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:30.580
discovery, and

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:35.969
endless possibilities. And even though school's, out there were plenty of lessons to be had. Literally.

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.270
One of my favorites was swimming lessons. Now

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.610
I don't want to brag, but I feel like I picked up swimming pretty naturally. After just a few lessons,

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.119
I possessed the speed, grace, and agility of a...

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:51.039
kronosaurus.

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:53.069
What? I like dinosaurs a lot.

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:58.259
Fine, dolphin. I possessed the speed, grace, and agility of a dolphin.

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.979
At least that's how I imagine myself. The thing is when you're 11,

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:08.279
there's not a whole lot you feel confident about. So for once, when I felt like I was above average at something, it was awesome.

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:15.330
One day, after I finished some exercises before everyone else, I had a particularly pleasant moment to myself.

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.169
As I floated there in the corner of the pool, I felt a sense of achievement,

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:21.990
peace, and

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:24.030
something else I couldn't quite pinpoint.

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:28.409
You know how they say physical activity releases endorphins, which make you feel happy?

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:30.909
Maybe it was that.

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:32.409
But it wasn't.

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:38.099
The sensation would come and go in waves, and each time it did, I felt like I understood it better.

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:40.650
It felt like a cool gentle breeze,

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:43.210
except under the water.

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:48.659
Weird. I adjusted my swim trunks, still unable to place my finger on it, until I

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:56.939
placed my finger on it. Where there was once fabric, there was flesh. The flesh of my left butt cheek.

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:02.280
I finally solved the mystery. Somehow, there was a huge tear on the back of my trunks that basically exposed

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:04.100
everything

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.280
How did this happ- How long had it been like that? Did I swim too hard? Was it simply poor swim trunk

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:15.479
construction? The only conclusion I made was that I couldn't keep swimming. I had to save myself and everyone else from indecent exposure.

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.020
The best place to be was right there in the corner, with my butt to the wall.

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.820
But I knew I couldn't stay there. And now the other kids were finishing, and the next exercises were about to start.

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.980
Time was running out, and I... I

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:27.790
had to get out.

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:32.699
The pool ladder was my best bet. I'd have to strategically time my exits so that my butt had maximum

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:38.339
wall coverage and minimal public exposure. As I made my way over, I kept feeling that cool

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:44.279
gentle breeze grazed my skin, again and again. When I finally got to the ladder,

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.570
I made one final glance around to make sure no eyes were on me. With my back against the wall,

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:53.279
I climbed the ladder until my top half was out of water, then made a quick 180 pivot for the remaining climb before speeding to

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:59.010
my towel. I grabbed it, wrapped it around myself, and both cheeks were triumphantly reunited with soft cotton. *exhales* Ahhhh...

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:06.389
Well, it had been a long, dreadful, even exhilarating afternoon, but I was so ready to go home.

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:09.930
*clock ticks* No, impossible.

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:11.530
HOW?

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:17.339
How did only five minutes pass since I got out of the pool? Then, the sad reality began to set in my mind.

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.500
My swimming lesson had just started, and it would be another two hours until my dad would pick me up.

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:27.149
Time stood still. I saw every moment of my life passed with

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:29.850
ironically obscured clarity.

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:32.070
Slowly sinking to a thick cloud of

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:35.969
infinite, existential limbo. Yeah, for two hours

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:40.470
I contemplated life, and how somehow my situation out of the water felt worse than when I was in.

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:43.050
What did I do to deserve this?

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:45.749
Thankfully, my dad arrived before I had to answer that question.

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:48.510
I'm not sure if I told him what happened that day. To be honest,

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:52.409
I don't remember a lot, because the whole swimwear malfunction traumatized me for life.

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:58.679
Just kidding. I'm good. If anything, I realized now how much I've changed and progressed.

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.260
I mean just think about it. 20 years ago,

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:07.469
I was too embarrassed to tell even one person about my exposed naked butt. And now, here

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:10.139
I am telling three million people. I

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:12.810
guess everything's better in

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:14.940
hindsight.

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:21.929
Hopefully you guys enjoyed that. This is actually a continuation of a collab we did a while back with Domics called "Awksome Adventures". We're

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:25.169
bringing it back with five new awkwardly awesome stories over the next month.

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.000
Shout out to Dom for bringing it all to life, and we'll see you next week. Bye!
