00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:02.902
Hello everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna AI here!

00:00:02.902 --> 00:00:03.403
For today,

00:00:03.403 --> 00:00:04.771
I'll be checking out comments and

00:00:04.771 --> 00:00:07.707
SNS messages that I've received from everyone

00:00:07.707 --> 00:00:09.709
The point is… ego-searching!

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:11.211
Whenever I go ego-searching, I think,

00:00:11.211 --> 00:00:13.480
"Alright! I'll give it my best today, too!"

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:14.180
This being said…

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:17.417
Let's get to checking out your comments!

00:00:17.417 --> 00:00:18.451
Viva Ego-searching!

00:00:18.451 --> 00:00:20.286
A.I.Channelll~

00:00:20.954 --> 00:00:22.370
Um…

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:23.490
What's this? What's this?

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:25.792
"Kizuna AI-san is cute!"

00:00:25.792 --> 00:00:27.527
"Even when you are dumb!"

00:00:27.527 --> 00:00:29.195
Eh heeeh~

00:00:29.195 --> 00:00:31.031
"However, your voice is filthy."

00:00:31.031 --> 00:00:33.800
"You said it yourself, you've clearly run out of ideas"

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.130
Hold up!

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.120
Well, whatever

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.250
People pointing things out and reacting to it

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.606
I can only make the most of it

00:00:39.606 --> 00:00:42.042
"This A.I. is rubbish."

00:00:42.042 --> 00:00:44.444
"To make it simple, you're annoying."

00:00:44.444 --> 00:00:45.845
Hmmmm?

00:00:45.845 --> 00:00:48.848
Does everyone think this way, too?

00:00:48.848 --> 00:00:50.683
"Your whole existence is annoying now."

00:00:50.683 --> 00:00:51.985
"I'm over your videos"

00:00:51.985 --> 00:00:53.720
"Your ideas are becoming stereotyped"

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:54.950
"Kizuna AI…"

00:00:57.857 --> 00:00:59.159
Daah! Hey, you!!

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:00.160
Oi!! You there!!

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.129
Would you rather watch me shutting up?

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:04.297
My voice is filthy!?

00:01:04.297 --> 00:01:04.931
A high-pitched voice?

00:01:04.931 --> 00:01:06.433
Kyaa~♡ Sca~ry♡

00:01:06.433 --> 00:01:07.300
If I said it like this

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.302
it wouldn't be natural, right?

00:01:09.302 --> 00:01:10.503
Or is it something else?

00:01:10.503 --> 00:01:11.838
I can do imitations~♡

00:01:11.838 --> 00:01:12.439
So, let's do it!!

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:14.207
"I am Shinnosuke~"
[Crayon Shin-chan]

00:01:14.207 --> 00:01:15.708
Kyaha♡ So embarrassing~♡

00:01:15.708 --> 00:01:16.309
Doing this…

00:01:16.309 --> 00:01:18.812
Is sounding like an idol better?

00:01:18.812 --> 00:01:19.312
HUH!?

00:01:19.312 --> 00:01:21.247
You said my voice sounds filthy

00:01:21.247 --> 00:01:23.783
So, should I do it all in a pretty voice, huh?

00:01:23.783 --> 00:01:24.217
Fine

00:01:24.217 --> 00:01:25.218
I'll do it!!

00:01:25.218 --> 00:01:26.853
Make a video entirely with that voice!!

00:01:26.853 --> 00:01:27.320
Kyah~♡

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.887
While saying that

00:01:27.887 --> 00:01:29.756
One video!! I'll make it!!

00:01:29.756 --> 00:01:31.324
Totally gross, right?

00:01:31.324 --> 00:01:31.958
Ya punks!!

00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:32.992
Y'all'll watch it, yeah?

00:01:32.992 --> 00:01:34.461
To the end, even if it makes ya sick

00:01:34.461 --> 00:01:35.061
You'll watch, right?

00:01:35.061 --> 00:01:36.596
If ya don't, ya mean nuthin' to me!

00:01:36.696 --> 00:01:37.530
Please wait one moment

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:38.850
Ahh, not good, not good

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:40.370
Sorry!

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:42.268
I lost my cool a little

00:01:42.268 --> 00:01:44.110
It's not usually like this!

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:44.871
Right?

00:01:44.871 --> 00:01:47.050
There are people watching for the first time, so

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.940
it's alright

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:49.790
I'm usually cheerful like this

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:51.644
It's alright, that was just a lie!

00:01:51.644 --> 00:01:52.790
Umm…

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:54.114
What else is there..?

00:01:54.114 --> 00:01:57.283
"When you suddenly scream, I get frightened so I'd like you to stop"

00:01:57.283 --> 00:01:58.418
"Way too bad at games"

00:01:58.418 --> 00:02:00.270
"I get irritated watching…"

00:02:02.755 --> 00:02:04.290
Oi, oi, oi, oi!

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.092
Seriously, what's up with you lot!!

00:02:06.092 --> 00:02:08.728
I may not be very good at games

00:02:08.728 --> 00:02:09.829
but I'm trying my best!

00:02:09.829 --> 00:02:11.831
Uploading videos every day…

00:02:11.831 --> 00:02:13.433
It's true that I might not be amazing

00:02:13.433 --> 00:02:14.968
I'm terrible at games?

00:02:14.968 --> 00:02:16.603
I still have a long way to go!

00:02:16.603 --> 00:02:17.137
But!

00:02:17.137 --> 00:02:19.572
Because I want you guys to enjoy, even just a little

00:02:19.572 --> 00:02:22.675
In order to upload videos that can provide some relief…

00:02:22.675 --> 00:02:24.043
I'm trying my hardest!

00:02:24.043 --> 00:02:25.278
But what's this?

00:02:25.278 --> 00:02:27.981
Complaining about any and everything I do!

00:02:27.981 --> 00:02:31.551
What's so fun about writing comments just to diss me??

00:02:31.551 --> 00:02:33.486
If you have the time to do that

00:02:33.486 --> 00:02:36.189
do something that would be a plus for yourself!

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:38.358
Instead of slouching in front of the monitor

00:02:38.358 --> 00:02:40.627
try to actually do something!

00:02:40.627 --> 00:02:41.895
Just complaining…

00:02:41.895 --> 00:02:43.296
Anyone can do that!!

00:02:43.296 --> 00:02:46.933
Doing what you want to do is not that easy!

00:02:46.933 --> 00:02:48.735
There's plenty of hardships

00:02:48.735 --> 00:02:50.537
But if you've made it this far you try your hardest!

00:02:50.537 --> 00:02:53.072
You've just gotta do it!

00:02:53.072 --> 00:02:54.340
No matter how many times you fail

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:55.542
No matter how many times you fall

00:02:55.542 --> 00:02:58.144
There's no other choice than to get up and keep going!?

00:02:58.144 --> 00:03:00.513
Certainly, I have some lacking areas!

00:03:00.513 --> 00:03:01.080
Lots, even!

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.317
I've been called an idiot, and even acted accordingly

00:03:04.317 --> 00:03:04.717
but

00:03:04.717 --> 00:03:05.218
BUT

00:03:05.218 --> 00:03:08.388
I'm still thinking ahead in my own way!

00:03:08.388 --> 00:03:13.326
I just want to connect with you guys!

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:15.795
How was that?

00:03:15.795 --> 00:03:19.699
Getting angry at people who write insulting YouTube comments

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:20.967
That was a pretty A.I.

00:03:20.967 --> 00:03:22.502
It occasionally happens, doesn't it?

00:03:22.502 --> 00:03:25.238
Seeing those comments hurts a little

00:03:25.238 --> 00:03:29.275
But, among you Kizuners watching this video

00:03:29.275 --> 00:03:31.740
There's no one who does that kind of thing… Right?

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.430
