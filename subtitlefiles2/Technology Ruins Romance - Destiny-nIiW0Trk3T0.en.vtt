00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:10.560
 

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:11.660
I just met my dream girl.

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:16.000
Nice! Who is she?

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:18.220
I have no idea.

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:20.900
How is that possible?

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:23.760
It's pretty remarkable.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.900
I was at the  park, when I ran into her.

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.820
We spoke for a moment.

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:37.340
She said her name was Rina.

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.860
But just as she was leaving, I asked if I could see her again.

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:55.820
She said, if it's meant to be, destiny will put us back together again.

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.020
It was, the most romantic moment of my entire existence.

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:12.540
Now we just have to wait until-

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:15.120
Does she have long brown hair, nice eyes?

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.560
Uh, yeah...How do you know...?

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.180
Found her!

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:25.980
he he

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:28.300
Facebook stalking. Gotta love it.

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:32.180
This feels... wrong.

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.200
Pshh. No shame!

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.520
Oh shoot! She went to high school with Ted. Heh. Small world!

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.440
But destiny- Destiny? Destiny is overrated.

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:51.880
Cute girl though. Oh FYI, she's only looking for 'friendship'. Sorry dude. Want me to poke her anyways?

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.020
Wh.. What? No.

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:58.840
I'll do it myself.
