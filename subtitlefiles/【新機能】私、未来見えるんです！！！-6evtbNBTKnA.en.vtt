00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:02.880
Hello everyone! Virtual Youtuber Kizuna Ai here!

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:05.440
To tell you the truth, there’s something I haven't told you

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:06.540
I...

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.460
Can see the future!!

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:09.280
That's why...

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.160
...Using one of my 108 functionalities, I, Kizuna Ai...

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.160
...Will be using my future prediction plugin...

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.300
To predict the future!!

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:16.120
Then, here I go!

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:18.320
A.I.Channeeeeeel!

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:19.700
I saw it!!

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.100
The time machine will be completed!!

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.300
It will be similar to the one appearing in Do***mon's world

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:27.420
If I’d have to choose between past and future...

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:28.900
I guess I'd choose to visit the past

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.440
After all, I can already see the future

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.620
If I could meet with my past self...

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:34.760
There are so many things I’d like to tell her

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.300
Hmm...? Even though the time machine will be completed...

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.400
...You will only be able to return 5 seconds to the past!?

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:42.420
Too short!!

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.000
I’m Kizuna Ai from the future! 
I don’t have enough time so listen closely

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.260
From now on, I’ll be studying English and several other languages...!

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.420
*End*

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:51.640
I saw it!!

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:52.880
One Kizuna Ai will be distributed...

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.400
...For each family in the world!!

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.800
I want to connect with everyone in the world, right?

00:00:58.800 --> 00:00:59.700
I made it!

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:00.740
Hmm...?

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.080
But the kind of Kizuna Ai will be at random

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.740
Please, know how to understand them

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:06.620
Hmm...?

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.760
*In the house of a certain family...*

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.260
Hello everyone!

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:12.980
I’m the Super A.I, Kizuna Ai!

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.600
What shall we do today?

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:15.820
Ask me what you want!!

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:16.680
I’ll do my best!!

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.440
Ah, I definitely can’t do whatever

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:20.820
Only those that are possible ♪

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.080
*In the house of a certain family...*

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:25.520
Hello everyone

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:26.960
*malfunctioning noises*

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.880
Hello everyone!

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:28.900
I’m the Super A.I...

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:29.920
*malfunctioning noises*

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.280
I’m the Super A.I, Kizuna Ai...!

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.560
*malfunctioning noises*

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.880
Listen, I’m sorry, can I recharge for a moment?

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.040
*malfunctioning noises*

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.400
*In the house of a certain family...*

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.140
Pleased to meet you

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:45.100
I’m Kizuna Ai

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.160
I know it's sudden, but...

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:47.240
Do you want to eat?

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:48.420
Do you want to take a bath?

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.560
Or maybe...?

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.040
A.I.Channel!

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:52.180
I saw it!

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.420
Kizuna Ai will turn into a YouTuber of the Milky Way!?

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.080
It’s true that as long as there is a screen, I can appear anywhere

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.100
That means that I can connect with all the beings of the universe!

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.860
But...

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:05.800
How will I be able to communicate with them?

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:07.440
Ah, hi!

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.140
My name is Ai Kizuna

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.040
Eh?

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:13.220
What language do E.T’s speak??

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.440
I’m not dangerous

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:16.240
Surely!

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:17.280
I am...

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.800
...Virtual YouTuber!

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:19.980
I want to record a video

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:20.880
Can I record you?

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.560
Ah!

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:22.980
Thank you! Thank you!

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.460
Thank you! Thank you!

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:25.240
Yaay! Yaay!

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:26.660
Very much! Very much!

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.000
Eh? You want me to go to your planet?

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.580
Eeeh? No, well, that's somewhat...

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.400
After all, I like the Earth

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.080
Eh? Eh?

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:38.400
My... my body...

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:39.120
Eehhhh?

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:40.080
...It’s floating

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.640
Eh?

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.020
Let me... Let me down!

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.180
Let me doooown!

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.060
There's more at the end!

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.000
