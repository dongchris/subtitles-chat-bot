00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:06.271
Trish come on!

00:00:06.271 --> 00:00:09.000
You are impossible Tommy. I don't know what to do with you!

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:13.229
I've never been so embarrassed in my entire life

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:15.300
(under breath) Oh my God

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:16.289
Get over it already!

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:17.400
What?!

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.640
You knew how important it was for me to make a good impression in front of the partners.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.160
And then you have the audacity to pull a stunt like that?

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:26.340
Well, I wasn't gonna let you walk all over me AGAIN

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:30.840
I'm tired of you treating me like my needs aren't important.

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.240
Your needs?!

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.480
This was my firm's holiday party.

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.480
Okay, fine. Yes the timing could have been better, all right?
-Yes, it could've!

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.289
But if someone asks me what I think of Taylor Swift's new album "Reputation"

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.079
I'm going to be honest and tell them I don't like it

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:48.599
But the new Taylor IS better than the old Taylor, right?

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.260
No

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.549
I'm sorry, okay. You know what actually I'm not sorry all right?

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:03.130
I miss the old Taylor

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:06.000
This isn't some small issue that I'm gonna lie about

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.760
just so we can look like a perfect little couple in front of your new group

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:09.596
of friends, okay?

00:01:09.596 --> 00:01:11.169
We're not just some couple Tommy

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:16.660
I'm your fiancee, and you promised me before we got engaged that you were with me on this

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:19.630
I thought I was, okay?

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.920
But the more mainstream she got

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.930
the more people started dancing to "Shake It Off" and claimed they were Taylor fans

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:27.404
I just couldn't, okay?

00:01:27.404 --> 00:01:28.110
These people

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:29.620
they don't know Taylor.

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:31.760
They don't know her like we do

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:33.440
You think they know that Dear John is about John Mayer?

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.040
They probably don't even know that "Dear John" is a song!

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.200
And now you're taking their pop-bandwagoning side.

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:39.759
I'm not taking sides!

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.690
Look, I thought we went over this with "1989".

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:47.100
I thought we agreed that she's still the same sweet Taylor that we fell in love with,

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.160
that it's perfectly okay for artists to evolve and expand,

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:51.729
and we should be happy for her.

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:55.330
I didn't even finish "1989".

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:56.990
What?!

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:58.700
You didn't hear "Clean"?!

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:59.899
What's the point?!

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:03.549
The Taylor that we fell in love with she was the underdog in school

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:06.249
And now she has-- now she has a squad of models

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.280
The old Taylor was, was shy and could barely even say "Hey Steven" without giggling

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.620
and now she's dated people like like Calvin Harris

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:16.130
Calvin (expletive)

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:17.420
Harris

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:18.429
and that- and that Tom

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:20.150
Fiddleditch guy.

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.530
Speaking of fiddles, when was the last time one of her songs even had a fiddle?

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:25.690
It's like I don't even know her anymore

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:28.510
I don't even know you anymore

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.720
You've forgotten everything that has made her who she is today.

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.869
I'm just open-minded and I know that people can change

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:37.190
for God's sakes

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.579
You still listen to her on CDs

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.800
So?

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.500
She's on Spotify now. What are you doing carrying around a discman?

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.809
I have a six CD changer in my car!

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:47.580
You know that!

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:52.720
Oh, you are so stubborn and so unwilling to grow with me and with her

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:55.269
How are we going to make a marriage work?

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:01.599
How are we gonna survive two, three, five, thirteen more albums when you're still stuck in the past?

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:08.048
The past is what makes us who we are

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.390
No.

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:14.470
The past is what makes us who we were

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:28.839
Maybe... who we are and the present is something different

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:35.639
What are you saying Trish?

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.400
I think we should stop sharing the same Taylor Swift playlist

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
And make new ones

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:48.510
With other people

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:54.800
Baby baby, what are you saying don't don't talk like that

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:55.720
What are you--

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:56.340
You're just caught up in the moment

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.060
Don't make this harder than it needs to be Tommy

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:04.139
When we first met in line of

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:07.340
that exclusive "Fearless" album signing

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.629
the three of us were so innocent

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:13.800
But people aren't meant to stay the same

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:17.700
So while I want to achieve my "Wildest Dreams"

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:21.400
You're stuck on "The Story of Us"

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:23.820
I'm looking ahead.

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:24.660
I'm ready for it,

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.880
but you just want to go "Back to December"

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:32.560
and I can't keep living like this

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.480
What happened to us?

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.429
Kanye.

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:56.580
I miss the old Kanye too

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:01.700
I think I should go

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:06.720
Oh Trish

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:07.860
Trish

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:10.760
Trish, what about "Sparks Fly"?

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:11.760
What about "Enchanted"?

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:13.940
Those are beautiful songs,

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:15.600
and maybe one day

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.580
you'll be listening to our greatest hits album,

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:18.640
and you'll understand

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:22.330
She just couldn't be your country, sweetheart forever

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:26.050
No no Trish

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:29.380
Stay for "Love Story"

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:32.050
Our "Love Story"

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:35.380
It's not even in my top 15 anymore

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:42.860
Noooooo!

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:46.740
(sobs hysterically)

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:54.580
"Our Song"...

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:58.280
Hey everyone, hope you guys like that short

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:02.220
I know we don't often do something about pop culture, but when we do we have a lot of fun with it

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:05.500
And we're obviously really big Taylor Swift fans here at Wong Fu
-Whoo!

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:08.360
Jan I don't about you, but old Taylor or new Taylor?

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:10.860
Gotta say, new Taylor! Gotta support!
-(feigns pain) Ah!

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:12.340
Okay, new Taylor is pretty cool,

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:13.400
but old Taylor though.

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:14.740
Okay, how about this, um

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:17.320
old One Direction or new, solo One Direction?

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:19.200
Uh... can't choose

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:21.280
Okay, here's the main question

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:23.360
old Wong Fu or new Wong Fu?

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:25.060
That's really hard

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:26.800
um, to be to honest, what's the difference?

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:29.320
The debate between old and new can go on forever

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:32.750
But all you need to know is that Wong Fu will keep making videos for you guys to enjoy

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.420
Thank you so much for watching!

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:35.800
Subscribe for more videos.

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:36.739
We'll see you guys next time!
