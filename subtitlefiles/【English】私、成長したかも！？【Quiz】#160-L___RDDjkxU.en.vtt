Well then... today with Ai-chan...

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:06.760
For the sake of learning...

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:08.480
Let's start studying English!

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:09.840
I'm going to give it my best today too!

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:13.340
First problem...

(Phrase by Estee Lauder)

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.800
"Because I ended up seeing.... the person's cross-dressing hobby..."

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.760
"I got into the rich life"

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:30.200
"Look for a sweet person"

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.060
"Exclude thinking about them being rich"

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:33.920
I was completely wrong, right?

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:35.660
Well, well... I was just warming up

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:37.660
(Phrase by Bob Marley)

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.580

"Tomorrow, they'll do it by hand..."

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.880
"There are people who feel the rain, but there are also people who just get wet"

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.980
I see...

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.060
That's deep... somehow, it's serious today, right?

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.060
(Phrase by Muhammad Ali)

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.500
Hey, I could read English just now!

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:06.000
Amazing!

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.780
"Boys, go and get dominated by girls!"

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
*laughs* However, it was completely wrong...

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.760
"The man who has no imagination has no wings"

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.800
Ah, it wasn't 'men' but 'man'...

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:18.020
This is 'man', this...

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:18.840
*laughs*

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.780
Ah, so, 'imagination' has the meaning of imagination (想像力)...

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:23.440
I see...

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:24.500
Let's go with this...

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:25.340

I 'dream'...

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.400
"I don't see dreams at night"

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.760
"I'm always seeing dreams"

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:44.820
Is what it looks like...

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.940
"I don't dream at night"

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:48.980
"I dream all day"

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:51.000
"I dream for a living"

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:51.500
Oh!

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.820
Oh, this is the best one so far!

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.060
That I got the feeling that I understood it

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:57.200
That's so clever!

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:59.780
I'm the smart, cute Ai-chan!

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:01.780
(Phrase by Michael Jordan)

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.080
I can... 'accept'...

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:28.940
What would 'accept' be?

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.320
This is sort of... ehm...

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:34.740
I'm... able to open a plastic bottle!

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:36.020
*laughs*

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:39.880
"I can accept failure, but I can't accept not trying"

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
I see, there's some good words today... so deep~

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:44.260
Right?

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.260
(Phrase by Jojo)

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:55.860
"Her hair!"

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.220
"I don't really like it!

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.220
"Surprising! Is that hair?!"

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.220
I sort of failed quickly there...

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.220
I thought there were good words there until the end...

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:05.480
Last problem!

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.000
[What is this English?]

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:37.620
Hmm?

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:39.600
"That's..."

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.240
"You can't eat breakfast inside Apollo"!

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.040
"It's not appropriate to say this during breakfast, but..."

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.200
"Seeing you in pain makes me happy"

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:55.860
*laughs*

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:56.940
Are you a sadist?!

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:59.960
Eh? What is this?

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:01.260
This is that, right?

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.100
When a couple no longer loves each other...

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:04.220
The wife...

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:06.080
Can't stand it anymore...

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.720
And gets tied to her husband...

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:12.980
Luring him by leaving him some poisonous food...

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:14.820
And until he eats it...

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:15.860
You're not allowed to leave...

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:17.100
That sort of thing, right?

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:19.500
Doing that during breakfast... with a smiling face~

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.460
Is what I feel the wife would do...

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:23.060
Aah...

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:24.300
That's dangerous...

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:26.500
Man, how was that?

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:27.820
Today, there were sort of...

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.440
A lot of deep phrases, right?

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:31.840
What happened in the last one?

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.400
Is it alright? Even if it was an artificial creation...

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:35.700
But, well...

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.220
I can read most of English...

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:40.880
I don't understand it yet, but that will surely come!

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.880
And for that, I will try my best!

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:45.380
Let's all do our best in English!

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:48.200
