00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:07.300
Wow...

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:09.100
This place is fancy

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:11.880
Caffè Expressiva...

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.180
More like Caffè Expensiva

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:15.240
No..

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:18.060
Who is your friend we're waiting on?

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.020
Oh Cody? Yeah, he isn't normally late.

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:21.080
Cody?

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:22.880
I'll wait for Cody

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:23.900
Oh good... Hehe

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:26.120
Wait, what do you mean by that?

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:27.220
Cody's hot

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:29.040
Heh...

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:30.420
My best friend, Cody

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.600
The guy with the limp and terrible asthma

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.300
Oh my god... I totally forgot about his inhaler

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:38.340
He's so cute when he can't breathe...

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.820
Rach, I've been friends with Cody since kindergarten

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.160
If anyone thought he was hot, I would know

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:46.100
Do you remember when Cody got his limp?

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.560
That summer when he's a life-guard?

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.760
Oddly enough, near-drowning incidents tripled that summer

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:52.960
All females...

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.240
The currents were abnormally strong that year

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:00.400
Why is it that anytime Cody's at your house, all of your sister's friends just

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.900
wanna hangout there too?

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.860
Our mom makes killer guac...

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:05.740
Everybody knows it

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.860
You know it

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:07.920
Cody's hot

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:08.700
Admit it

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:12.900
Sorry Rach, I just don't see it

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:40.200
Mike BOW CHICKA WOW WOW

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.560
Ahhh...

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.980
I hate you

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.040
Hey guys, so sorry I'm late

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.420
/in unison/ Hey Cody...

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:50.420
Wow... this place is fancy

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:52.740
More like Caffè Expensiva

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:56.820
Ahahaha oh my god, you're so funny

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.180
I'm gonna go to the restroom

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:59.280
Okay!
*asdfghjkl Taylor's shaking voice*

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.100
You know what else...?

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.280
He doesn't even knows he's hot

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.580
which makes him SO MUCH HOTTER...

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:07.300
I can't talk to you

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.800
You know what's crazy that he's still friends with you

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.780
Better looking people just naturally gravitates towards each other

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.800
Cody

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:16.300
Yeap

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:17.960
Have you ever thought about modelling?

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.720
*gasps* I can't let him find out that he's hot

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:22.840
Gotta go Rach, gotta go

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.800
Okay bye

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:27.340
So the thing about Rachel, you know...

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:28.560
Yeah, it was pretty rude back there...

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.420
No, she's sick. She's contagious, we shouldn't hang out with her...

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:32.620
Oh okay

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.700
Hope she feels better...

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.620
Excuse me

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:37.540
NO THANK YOU

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:43.060
Yeah...

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:44.440
Okay...

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.400
aaahhhAAHHHHHH erghhHHHH

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:53.280
The heck was that?

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.560
Errr... TAG YOU'RE IT Hehehehhehe

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:00.940
Well, I mean this joke was really funny...

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:03.580
Ayeeeeee

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:05.700
We're having a boy's night...

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:06.820
Sorry... Hehehe

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:08.000
Thanks

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:09.640
Dude, she was cute!

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:15.520
I just wanna get a drink with my best bro

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:16.160
that expression reminds me of the time taylor slaps wes

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.560
Hey...

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.120
These are on me...

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:22.200
NO!

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:23.140
THEY ARE ON ME!

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:25.520
*ding dong*

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:27.340
Hey... Make yourself at home

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:28.340
Yeah... So

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.760
How about we go to the beach?

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:36.420
Nooooo...

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:39.660
Okay! Erm, what do you wanna do?

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.780
Umm... Let's just kick back, relax and watch a movie!

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:45.440
Great...

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:46.360
I'll invite Rachel

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.960
whoever did this edit, may God bless you AHAHAAH

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:53.260
Noooooo...

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.680
Look Jordan, we have to talk

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:59.060
You've been acting super awkward

00:03:59.060 --> 00:03:59.780
You never wanna go out

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:01.500
You yell at that bartender

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:02.060
HEY

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:04.380
It was a really loud bar

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:06.460
I feel like I don't even know you anymore

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:08.400
What's wrong with me wanting to spend time with you?

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:09.600
By ourselves...

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:10.100
One on one...

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.880
And absolutely no women...

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:14.160
Okay, I gotta go

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:17.080
When you ready to be honest with me, just let me know

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:18.460
But I'm ready, I'm ready...

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:19.860
Sit down...

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.480
Okay, the truth is that...

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:25.780
I realize that you're hot...

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:27.980
I'm what...?

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:29.060
You're hot

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:30.980
I know it

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:32.900
Everybody knows it

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:35.420
But you don't know it

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:38.620
I act the way I did because I was scared that if you found out you're hot

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:39.980
You'll leave me for...

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:42.000
hotter friends...

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.020
Jordan, what other people think about me

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:46.820
does not change the way I think about you

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:50.840
You're not only friends with me 'cause you haven't made hotter friends yet?

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:52.260
Dude...

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.020
We're friends for life, 'kay?

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:58.140
You're a good friend

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:58.640
I know

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:00.980
Unlike my sister's friends

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:02.740
Oh what do you mean?

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:05.480
Rachel told me that her friends are only friends with her

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:07.740
so they can come over here and spy on you

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:09.220
Isn't that terrible?

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:11.280
Befriending someone just to get with some else?

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:14.540
Yeah... that's messed up

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:16.420
What's messed up?

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:18.240
Nothing, Sis...

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:20.720
Jordan, did you eat all of mom's guac?

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:22.720
Bottom shelf

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:27.120
Cedar, you still wanna hit up the beach?

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:00.180
NAWWWWWWWWWWWW

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:08.680
Hey guys, hope you like that short!

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:13.460
If you like Jordan, I hope you realize that true friendship isn't based on looks

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:15.960
It's based on siblings

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:16.620
NO

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:17.120
Oh...
