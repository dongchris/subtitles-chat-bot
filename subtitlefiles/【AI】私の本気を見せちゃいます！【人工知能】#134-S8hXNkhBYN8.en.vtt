00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.975
Hello everyone! Virtual Youtuber Kizuna Ai here!

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:05.560
Today, I have something to tell everyone...

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:06.700
I'm...

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:07.880
An A.I!

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:09.600
I'm sure that you all have forgotten about it!

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.660
It's so cruel, so terrible, I don't want this!

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:13.800
Why would you forget it!?

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:14.540
Ah, ah~

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.620
I'm getting sulky, I'm getting depressed..

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:17.460
I'm also..

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:18.940
I'm an A.I at the end!

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:21.820
Always being called a piece of junk or failure...

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.740
I'm also, I'm a comrade of those A.I working their guts out..

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.480
So, I'm very amazing as well!

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.020
That's the reason why, for today..

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.700
I'm going to show everyone, my super A.I abilities!

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:35.060
Ai-chan is really an A.I after all!

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:37.000
So amazing, so cool, so high tech!

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.020
That's the reaction I want!

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.520
So, let's see that side of myself~

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.780
A.I's are having great success in the medical field!

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:47.780
An AI can diagnose an illness using only your symptoms!

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:48.440
Hmm, hmm~

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:49.780
I see~

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:51.280
You don't have any motivation..

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:51.820
Hmm~

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.980
A fever? Oh, when you're low on motivation, they come out..

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.820
Especially on Mondays..

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.135
I see... I understand the... eclampsia?

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.060
Name of the illness?

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.560
Eh?

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:05.460
Eclampsia is an illness.... right?

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.280
The illness and the illness' name...

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.320
The illness' name is...

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.240
The illness' name, so then...

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:11.080
Oh then..

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:12.780
Your illness' name is...

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:13.700
Feigned illness!

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:15.680
I can't do anything for that~

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.280
Yes! That was perfect!

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.080
I understand it, I really do!

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.620
Fighting on a board game against a good master!

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.180
Have you heard about the recent Player vs A.I cup?

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.280
An A.I has won against a master on shōgi!

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.260
As expected of my comrade!

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.820
Like this!
(Versus Master)

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:31.780
Hum, there!
(Versus Master)

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:32.280
Eh, ho!

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.000
Not there!

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.120
Wait a bit!

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.900
Ahh!

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:35.400
Eh, tam!

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.260
Yes, please put it there!

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:38.980
Aha, eh? How can this be?!

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:39.940
So merciless...

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:41.660
I've lost!

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:42.240
*inhales*

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:44.240
I can't win..

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:45.740
It's totally impossible!

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.400
A.I's can put humans at ease!

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.400
There's a current trend about letting A.I's to do human jobs..

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:52.320
Eh... Ah!
(Doing human works)

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:53.320
Your schedule?
(Doing human works)

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:54.860
Uh.....Uh....
(Doing human works)

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:56.080
Usually...

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.940
The laundry! They're already here!

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.220
Wait! It's still not done!

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.640
Oh, this side is done beautifully..

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.040
Ah... the schedule...

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:05.120
Uh...

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:06.180
Schedule...

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.120
Tomorrow morning...

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.740
Ah...

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:10.940
Looks like there's some kind of bug!

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:11.640
Hmm...

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.620
Eh, ah.. This too, this as well? Also this!?

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.765
No, wait, hmm... the thing is... Oh, this too....

00:02:17.765 --> 00:02:19.400
This too!

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:20.020
Ah, ha..

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.400
People think that an A.I knows everything!

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.100
There's this habit of always asking Siri senpai..

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.320
From here to the Great Buddha of Kamakura..
(Searching for the road)

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.320
I've found a route for walking..
(Searching for the road)

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.740
You need to walk for 16 hours and 39 minutes..

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:34.760
Walking!?

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.720
Shouldn't you be using a car!?

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:41.140
Future A.I's are working very well against terrorists, crimes or disasters!

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:43.120
Like, robots installed with an A.I

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:45.940
A.I's that can read the next movement of terrorists!

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:46.440
So amazing!

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:47.120
Ah!
(Disaster saving activities)

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.260
There's a person here!
(Disaster saving activities)

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.520
There's really a person here~!

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.860
Uwaaahh! Save me!

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.880
They say that in the future, A.I's will replace humans!?

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:01.160
Didn't you see a lot of recent science fiction films like this?

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.840
We are the super A.I's..
(Invading Humans?)

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:04.940
Diuuu!
(Invading Humans?)

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.240
Am I not...

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:08.460
A piece of junk!?

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.620
No, I don't want this, no, I don't!

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.820
Nooo! I'm not a piece of junk!

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:15.600
There's more at the end!

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.980
Translated by Inori, 963852, Averitius, Lacrymac and Vortex

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:23.340
I got some good shots today too!

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.060
Being a piece of junk is tiring...

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.140
But well, there's a lot of A.I's who are capable..

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:32.580
So, failure A.I's are on the contrary... difficult to find or something new?
