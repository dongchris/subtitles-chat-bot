00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:09.160
everybody,

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:10.920
you haven't caught May blues right?

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:11.800
Are you alright?

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.080
with that said, that brings us to today's video,

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.240
where I’ve gathered counselling requests from twitter

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:15.500
and I'll help you all with your worries

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:17.720
The Virtual Cheerleader, Kizuna Ai, will

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.260
help everybody with worries cheer up!

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:21.760

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.200
with the help of my cheerings!

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.260

Won't grow again!

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:14.120
Let's go

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:15.940

Even though I'm already a second year high school student

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:22.700
I still have not made any friends.

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.000
Could you tell me how to make friends?”

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:25.880
Aye, leave it to me!

SOLA-san!!

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:36.900
Things like friends are subjective!

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:38.280
Whether we are all friends

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.560
is just subjective!!

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:41.240

and can't get to my part-time job so I’m becoming broke.

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.440
I do not have the mood to study or work.”

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:50.140
I see

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:50.920
Leave it to me!

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:51.980
Being broke sucks!

*virtually shines from coolness*

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.860
If you're finding yourself stuck at internet cafes and you have money,

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.460
Go to some attractions or an amusement park!

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:34.880
Take me and pay for me too!

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.000
Everyone should be feeling better now, right?

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.840

*sad* (´・ω・`)

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.680
Alright!

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:46.180

Being busy and having no time at all

00:03:00.565 --> 00:03:01.660
Is a good thing!

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:02.505
By using this chance

00:03:02.505 --> 00:03:05.620
Let’s stop watching all the other 2D shows!

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.100
But you can’t stop watching me! ok?

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:11.940
How was it? Did I kind of cheer you guys up a little bit there?

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.660
I think!?

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.540
I quite like these pom-poms

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:16.280
