00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.860
Hello everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna AI here!

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:05.520
In this occasion, it’ll be about that which I like so much

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:06.980
I’ll do many delusions with the following plan:

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.880
"I’ll do delusions of this and that by my account with Keyakizaka46"

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:12.560
Having said that...

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:17.720
...I’ll present the Draft of Keyakizaka46 that I usually do every night!
(Draft: Sports competition in which professional teams select players from a pool of players)

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.660
A draft of Keyakizaka 46 implies that...

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:20.660
...Travelling...

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:21.860
...Eating!

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:23.840
...They’re delusions that I imagine in a lot of different situations

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:30.020
It's a game in which I choose, like as if it was a draft, to one of the members of Keyakizaka46, depending on who I want to spend time with in that situation

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.420
Since it's a delusion... I can choose at my whim, right?

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.100
I normally do these kinds of things alone

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.420
Yes, you, there! Don’t move away, please! Yes?

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.420
First off, the draft to go together to a deserted island!

00:00:42.095 --> 00:00:44.645
The member that wants to choose ...
(Phrase used to announce the players chosen by the teams)

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.740
...The Virtual YouTuber Kizuna AI during the first round

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.020
Oda Nana!

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.360
Man, it took me some to decide

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:57.620
I’m sure that Oda Nana wouldn't stop smiling even in a deserted island!

00:00:57.745 --> 00:01:00.985
And I'm sure that she would protect me with her maternal instinct!!

00:01:00.985 --> 00:01:02.480
I think she would give me courage

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:07.400
Even though I would be worried, saying: “What should we do? We are in a deserted island, it could be that we could never return"

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.440
"Don’t worry, hahahaha!"

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.920
Well, I think that with her coming along,everything will be happier, right?

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:13.560
And... supposing...

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.700
Oda Nana is definitely a woman

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.380
If she were secretly crying

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:18.360
In that moment...!

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.500
...It’d be "Kizuna AI man”’s turn!

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.720
I’d say to her: "Are you okay? Don’t worry, Oda Nana"

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.720
"I’ll protect you! Yee?"

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.180
And with that, I’d turn the situation around in an instant!

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.060
I'm sure that even she would fall in love with me

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.060
Right?

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.240
And the other girl who I was hesitant on is...

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.420
Nagahama Neru-chan

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:36.920
Neru-chan is a savage girl, so then...

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.400
...Well, she could definitely survive even in a deserted island, right?

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.100
In a deserted island...

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.520
… It’s true, even though I’d like to be Neru and Oda Nana the most

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:47.960
In a deserted island...

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.440
…But I worry how I’d spend the days together with Oda Nana

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:52.560
But just like I said before...

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.900
...Well, essentially Oda Nana would protect me, but...

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:58.680
...From time to time, I’d continue to protect her

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:02.740
It's like we wouldn't have any worries in the deserted island, but instead we’d be happy

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.780
We could live an entire life together!!

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:06.640
Next up...!

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.980
"The draft for going together after school  with our school uniforms to Sweet Paradise!"
(Sweet Paradise = Cake shop)

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:13.100
Hypothetically speaking, it would be who would I like to go to the same high school together with

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:14.360
After all, it's a delusion, right?

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.300
Everyone, make sure to follow along with me!!

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:19.200
The member that wants to choose...

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.220
...The Virtual YouTuber Kizuna AI during the first round

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:24.120
Man, this...

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:25.220
...Is now...

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:26.720
...Decided

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.840
Moriya Akane-chan!

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:30.920
Akanen!

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:31.920
Man...

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.140
If we're talking about Akanen...

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:34.500
...Lately in Keyakizaka...

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.340
…The episode in the selection of members  of USJ was made, right?

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:45.400
But since the beginning... I cried, thinking: "I wasn’t chosen either", even though I really left an adorable impression, but...

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:46.680
Definitely...!

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.460
...Since we’d be going together after school with our school uniforms...

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.380
...So then I should definitely go with my favorite member, right?

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.880
Together with Akanen, we’d be asking: "Eh? Which do you want to eat? Which do you want to eat?"

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.240
"Ah! I will also eat that one then"

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.620
And well, since it's about Sweets Paradise, you can eat whatever you want with a fixed price

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.180
"Eh? Ah, I also want to try a bite, aaaahh!"

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:05.480
We'd be doing something like that

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:06.680
It'd be something like that

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:08.560
Next up!

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.440
The draft for renting a small car in a rental auto store and go for a one night two days trip to a hot spring

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.420
The member that wants to choose...

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.620
...The YouTuber Virtual Kizuna AI during the first round

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:20.980
Sugai

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:22.540
Habu

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:24.220
Shida!

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:25.300
Yes

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:27.420
When you reach my level...

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.600
...You can spend an entire night deluding, right?

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:30.780
In this occasion...

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.300
… I chose three people

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:34.680
Well, first...

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.940
...Let’s see... Habu-chan and Sugai-chan...

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:41.400
...In a program, well... to tell you the truth, they get along really well, so then...

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.500
...They were together in a deserted island, right?

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:48.260
And well, unexpectedly... how do I say it... in fact, they seem like complete opposites...

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:50.080
Shida-chan and Sugai-chan...

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:51.800
...They get along well, so then...

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.400
...If it were those three, well...

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.080
...It’s not a usual combination for the programs, but...

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:59.460
… I thought it'd be fun, so then...

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.860
Mona, well, definitely... well...
(Mona is Shida’s nickname)

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:05.060
… She’d do some strange movement and she’d laugh

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:07.500
She'd laugh, saying "Weeeei!"

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.480
And well Habu-chan and Sugai-chan

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:12.360
In fact they're both calm so they’d have fun together

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:17.300
And well, definitely... I'd be surrounded in female elegance...

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:19.120
Would it’d be like a harem??

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.880
Man, well…

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:22.360
...Each one of them has a different personality...

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.780
...Well, I'm sure that everyone would follow me

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:29.360
Certainly, certainly, I think we’ll be spending such a happy time together

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:30.740
Maybe...

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:35.740
...they will pull me by the arms, saying: "Eh? AI-chan was supposed to take a bath with me"

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:37.520
They’d get me in trouble

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:39.260
A.I.Channel ♥

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:41.540
Man! I got really excited! Right?

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:43.000
I'll say a lot more delusions!

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:44.360
The next theme will be...

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:47.840
"Year 20XX, a mysterious asteroid is approaching Earth!"

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:52.620
"To to avoid the collision, they travel in a new kind of rocket to outer space!"

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:54.880
"Officer Commander Kizuna AI is entrusted with the destiny of all humanity!"

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:59.080
"And she has to choose 14 members from the group Keyakizaka46 to do this life or death mission!"

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.720
"Who will she choose...!?"

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:04.720
