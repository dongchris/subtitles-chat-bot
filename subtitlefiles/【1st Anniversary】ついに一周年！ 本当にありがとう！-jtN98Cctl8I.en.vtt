Thank you so much for always watching A.I.Channel! Kizuna Ai here!

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:09.420
Today, I want to show you my feelings of gratitude in this video...

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.080
...For being able to get through in this year

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:11.900
A year ago...

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:15.060
"I want to learn a lot about human beings!"
"I want to get along with everyone!"

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:17.940
With those thoughts, I uploaded my first video on YouTube!

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:18.560
At the beginning...

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.540
"I wonder if everyone is watching me"

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:22.540
"I wonder if they’re having fun"

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:24.480
I uploaded my videos thinking that, but...

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.480
...Little by little, the people who were watching me increased...

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:32.100
...And I reached 10 subscribers, 100 subscribers, 1,000 subscribers, 10,000 subscribers, 100,000 subscribers!

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:36.340
People from all over the world started to watch my videos and send me their comments

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.740
That way, I could connect with more people...

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:41.720
...By inviting guests to play together and participate in events!

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:45.200
Playing games together, and also... celebrate my birthday!

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.380
Since I started being a YouTuber, I connected with everyone and was able to do a lot of fun things

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:51.960
People all over the world who are watching A.I.Channel...!

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.120
Thank you so much for being with me to this day!

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.000
Thanks to all the people who encouraged me, I got through the year...

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.680
And I was able to also fulfill the wish I announced during my introduction to participate in an CM!

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.480
And above all, I was able to connect with a lot of people!!

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:07.860
Starting from today, the second year of A.I.Channel begins!

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.940
I want to connect with a lot, a lot more people than I’m connected to now!

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.580
And also...! I have a new goal!

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.320
My goal is...

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:19.200
Kizuna Ai Fes!

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:20.860
I want to do a Festival!

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:22.200
I want to lose control completely!

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.860
I want to talk, play games!

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:25.300
Sing and dance!

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.180
Eat and drink...!

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.220
Well, I leave that to you guys!

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.600
Whatever, I want to share fun moments with people all around the world!

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:37.240
Don’t you think that this way, I could connect much, much more strongly with you guys?

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.840
I’ll work hard starting from now following that dream!

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.080
If there is something I can do or you’d like me to do something, don’t hesitate to request me!

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:47.740
Thank you very much for seeing the video until the end!

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.820
I’ll keep counting on your continuous support on A.I.Channel

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.080
I want to connect with you!

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.300
This was Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai!

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:57.920
