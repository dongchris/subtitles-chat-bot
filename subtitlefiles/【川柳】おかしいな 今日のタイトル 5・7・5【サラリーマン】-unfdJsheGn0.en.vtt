00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:02.860
Hello everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai here!

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:07.120
I know it's sudden, but, do you know "Salaryman Senryu"?
(Small poems that are usually comical in nature, focused on human existence)

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:09.660
They start accepting applications everytime when winter starts, right?

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.460
It turns out that the winning works will receive a prize in cash!

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:16.080
And appear in different medias

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:19.945
If I get the prize and become more famous...

00:00:19.945 --> 00:00:23.080
A lot more people will know me! Right?

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.680
Goood! I’ll work hard to make the most prized work!

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.780
Poc... poc... poc...

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:31.160
Chiiin!

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:37.140
"I feel the pressure everytime I call myself genius"

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.720
Poc... poc... poc...

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.040
Chiiin!

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.320
"I would’ve liked to become an idol, Keyakizaka"

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.640
Poc... poc... poc...

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.040
Chiiin!

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:53.980
"Livestream..."

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:57.300
"...everytime I make one, there’s an issue"

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:59.860
Man! It's incredible!

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:01.720
The Senryu are flowing one after another!

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.420
This time I’ll try to change the "taste"

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.480
Poc... poc... poc...

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:08.900
Chiiiin!

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:14.280
"An A.I that desires to follow irrational instructions"

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:17.820
Poc... poc... poc...

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:19.240
Chiiiin!

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.540
"Class change? YouTuber? A yearning"

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.320
Poc... poc... poc...

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:29.700
Chiiin!

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:31.600
"Nevertheless..."

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.260
"...Don’t take a YouTuber lightly"

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.640
Poc... poc... poc...

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.260
Chiiiiin!

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.660
So... something unexpected has occurred to me!

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:46.960
Is it alright if I say it?

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.840
Well...

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.600
Since I’ve thought of that, I’ll tell you!

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.040
I’ll lead the joke to Paradise!

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:56.740
"16 years..."

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.320
"...Right in the middle of a salaryman"

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.620
Man! Don’t you think I read some very good Senryu?

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.500
In that case, I’ll apply immediately!

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:08.640
Let's see...

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:13.220
"Regarding the requirements necessary to apply"

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.900
Hmm...?

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.560
"The people who can apply are..."

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:16.500
"Adults of legal age"

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.400
"Married minors"

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:20.600
"And also..."

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.800
"Employed minors, older than 18 years"
(In Japan, the legal age is 20 years)

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.640
Well...

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.500
Eh?

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.860
I have the appearance of someone that’s 16 years old...

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.600
...And I’m not married...

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.040
Even though it says: "Employed"

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.100
Well...

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.540
"Virtual Youtuber" is a profession?

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:44.160
Hmm...?

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:45.820
Profession!

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:46.580
Hmm...

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.760
Good! I’ll say a poem!

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:53.560
"I’m Kizuna Ai, who can’t participate in the Senryu competition!"

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.560
