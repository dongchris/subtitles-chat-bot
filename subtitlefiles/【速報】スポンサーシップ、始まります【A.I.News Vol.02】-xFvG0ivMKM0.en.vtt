Hello everyone! Virtual Youtuber Kizuna Ai here!

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:07.480
Everyone, do you know what happened January this year?

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:09.740
That's right! My account was banned!

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:11.140
Well...

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:13.320
Whatever happened was still a good memory...

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.740
Even though I was innocent at that time!

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:17.600
"DAMN YOU, YOUTUBE!!!!"

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.600
I also thought about stuff like that

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:20.740
Honestly

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:23.800
However, as an appreciation for my hard work

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:24.840
Kizuna Ai has...

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.940
Started a Youtube sponsorship!!

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:29.580
Yay~~ I did it!

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:31.160
Sponsorship!

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:32.480
SPONSORSHIP!

Sponsorship

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:42.400
The one who got picked was

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:43.800
Kizuna Ai

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.220
Thank you very much! Thank you very much!

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:54.000
Hello everyone, how are you doing?

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.600
Little head great wit
*Japanese proverb*

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:57.540
Kizuna Ai

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:01.220
A little bit earlier when Kizuna Ai-san was making a fuss about her sponsorship...

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.080
It was a bit hard to understand everything all at once right?

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.840
So that's why today's theme will be....

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.960
Youtube Sponsorship Beta mode

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.340
In a few words, Sponsorship is...

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.420
...a paid content system by YouTube

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.840
Every month, when paying a fixed amount you receive a custom badge, access to sponsor only posts.

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:26.020
Emoji, sponsor only chat and other benefits

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.340
To sponsor me...

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:33.400
First, go to the top page and either click or tap "sponsor"

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.800
Follow the instructions in the screen and input your pay method

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.540
Either click or tap "buy"

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.320
Once the purchase is completed, a welcome message will be displayed

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:45.340
And that is it for

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.260
How to apply as a sponsor

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.580
Now, we will talk about some warnings

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:55.200
Currently, the sponsorship is in beta mode

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.140
There may be problems with functionality or other unexpected problems

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.300
Also, because it is in beta...

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.480
There are many channels where this feature cannot be used

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.620
The monthly fee is also a currently fixed amount, but...

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:14.260
It’s possible for the fee to change at the final release

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.260
"Devices where this can be used"

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:20.960
Only a computer or an Android device can be used

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:22.560
In the event of iOS...

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.120
There are some functions allowed

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.760
But not all basic functions will be usable

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:28.380
That’s it

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.240
We’re sorry for the inconvenience

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.440
We kindly ask for your understanding as it is still in beta

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.900
Now, let's hear from Kizuna Ai-san

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.420
About the original benefits of sponsoring A.I.Channel

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:40.800
Let's hear her story

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:42.220
Go ahead!

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.060
Yep! Definitely!

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.460
First of all, bloopers...

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:49.200
I’ve done it in many videos

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.600
But it's embarrassing....

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.080
Right?

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:54.340
But I'll show them!

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.840
(You're a super A.I, but you make bloopers)

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:02.720
Next, rejected video uploads!

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:06.020
Well… Clearly I don't have any rejected videos, but...

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.540
I gathered the videos that weren't that high in quality

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.980
So it is possible it may come up

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.040
Well, this is also embarrassing but...

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:16.140
I'll show it!

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.940
And, and!

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.080
Behind the scenes of videos!

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.520
Those few minute videos to just past 10 minute ones

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:24.100
Definitely had some dramas when recording!

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:26.740
I will also show the behind scenes!

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:29.100
(So you can expect to see me being more useless than in my videos)

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:30.780
What?
(So you can expect to see me being more useless than in my videos)

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:34.260
Online game recording announcements

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.680
If timing allows it and we meet online

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.860
It may be possible to join in the recording

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:43.200
And finally, sponsor-only comment replies!

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.640
I will enjoy communicating with everyone!

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:48.800
Well...
* (Thank you, lastly, would you like to say a message to all your viewers?)*

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.740
"Because sponsorship just started"
* (Thank you, lastly, would you like to say a message to all your viewers?)*

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:53.300
"Won't A.I.Channel change then?"
* (Thank you, lastly, would you like to say a message to all your viewers?)*

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:55.660
I think there may be some people who are thinking along the lines of that
* (Thank you, lastly, would you like to say a message to all your viewers?)*

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:57.480
But A.I.Channel won't change!

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.760
Same as before, five uploads a week!

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.380
And adding A.I.Games videos

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:03.020
I'll be uploading everyday!

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:04.900
Sponsoring costs money

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:06.920
Even though there are probably various opinions on this

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:08.980
Because I've been doing my best till today...

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:10.420
Because everyone has been supporting me

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:12.220
I was able to get this chance

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:13.520
I want to do even better!

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:16.300
I'll be happy if everyone will watch over me with caring eyes

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:18.140
That's it! And this was Kizuna Ai!

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:21.820
"About Youtube Sponsorship beta mode"

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:23.980
Were we able to convey the message along to everyone?

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:28.340
Until next time with the latest A.I. news

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.580
And finally, some last words before leaving

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:32.460
At long last, we have finally met
*Japanese proverb*

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.460
Let's meet again until then!

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.220
Bye!

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:45.920
