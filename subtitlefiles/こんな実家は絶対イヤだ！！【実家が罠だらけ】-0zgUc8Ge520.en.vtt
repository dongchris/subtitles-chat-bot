00:00:00.505 --> 00:00:02.855
Hello everyone! Virtual Youtuber Kizuna AI here!

00:00:02.855 --> 00:00:05.585
The cold weather seems to continue

00:00:05.585 --> 00:00:08.520
Everyone, don’t you feel like you just want to stay in your houses?

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:12.580
I found the perfect game for the people who want to stay at home in the country!

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:15.140
"Parents' home are full of traps"

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:17.080
Without further ado, let's start!

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.280
Soiyaaaaa

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:21.720
Please be aware of the sound!

00:00:23.005 --> 00:00:24.665
"Ha... That was a great sleep" Good morning!

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:27.695
"It's already that late?" Yeah it's already that late!

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:28.820
You're late!

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:34.880
“Oh, man. I was so tired that I went back to my parents’ house…”

00:00:34.945 --> 00:00:40.460
That’s right! The mother could have… Gone to wake him up… That would be the right thing to do, don’t you think so?

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.100
"Hum?"

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.140
"What is this yellow thing?"

00:00:46.485 --> 00:00:47.625
"Weird thing"

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:49.860
"What's this?"

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.900
Ehhhhhhhhhhh?

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.220
Game title: "Parents' home are full of traps"

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.040
It exploded...

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.040
This game is an, so called, escape game

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.080
You clear the game once you escape your parents' house

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:16.120
But, your parents' house is full of "Weird thing"... "Weird thing"? Oh that one just now?

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:21.000
If you touch it carelessly, it will create a huge explosion

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.200
So stay away from those "Weird thing"s and escape safely!

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:26.360
That's it

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.380
So I just don’t have to press it, right?

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.060
This will be a piece of cake!!

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:31.280
Start!

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.060
Eeehh?

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:35.980
This? What's this?

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:37.840
Oh, it's a letter

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.680
"For our son, we have something to do so we’ve left for a while"

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.480
“We've altered your place a bit as part of development of a new toy"

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:47.860
"A bit"!? Listen...

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.760
Don't you think it's not good to alter something to make it explode?

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:52.920
“It's because of that, the door doesn't open"

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:53.420
Damn it!!

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:57.880
“The door will remain closed until you press the device that opens it so then work hard to find it"

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.620
You guys are the worst!!

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:03.080
"PS: there's a secret in the red poster’s symmetry”

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:04.020
I see

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.640
The symmetry with the red poster... Mmm...? Mmm...?

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:08.320
Eh?

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:10.820
Aaaahhh...

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:12.860
Eeeeehhhh!?

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:14.340
I messed up?

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.340
I was just planning on checking it a bit...

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.240
This is also just a trap?

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.340
Maybe it's that circular yellow thing?

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:22.600
Isn't it just a trap!?

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:23.420
Here

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.080
Ah, and now I should check here, right?

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.720
Ok

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:30.020
Here

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.840
Noooo! I'm sure that this will explode!

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.020
Ah! It's certain!

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:38.340
Ah! I see...

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:39.080
Here?

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:40.360
Oh, there's...

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:41.880
Ah, I don't want to touch it!

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:45.960
I also don't like these boxes

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:47.380
The TV

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:49.040
Mmm...?

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.840
"Holy Nightmare"

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.400
It seems like an adequate title, right?

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.760
"Push space to start"

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.300
Very good! Here I go!

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:59.360
Tou!

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:00.520
"Game instructions"

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.100
“From the TV above, weird things will start to come out of it..." 🤣

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:09.780
“Controlling a character dressed in pajamas, you’ll have to avoid bumping into them"

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:14.740
If you can survive fleeing during the time that appears in the lower right part of the screen, you've cleared the game"

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:16.280
“Nevertheless, if you managed to bump into a wierd thing..."

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.400
Surely, everything will start to explode again, right?

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:19.080
Mmm...!

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.600
Yes!

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:20.480
Mmm...?

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:22.360
Mmm...?

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:24.800
Ready! Go!

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:26.740
Ah, I see!

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:28.520
Ah! It can hit me?

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.540
Aaahh! And also more will appear, right?

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:35.240
Eh?

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:37.120
Another one appeared...!

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:38.620
Ah...! Aaaaahhhh!!

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:40.120
Noooo!

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.440
Noooo! Don't get any closeeeer!!

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.020
I got it! Wouldn't it be best to stay close to the borders?

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:46.740
Ah! Hahahaha...

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:48.140
Ah, I can do it!!

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:50.040
Aaaahhh!!

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:51.240
Nooooo!

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.340
Ah! Shouldn't I stay here? Close to the clock

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:54.520
Ah! Ah! Ah!

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:58.640
No, don't lose...

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:01.460
Don't keep increasing!

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:02.400
Eeehhh?

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:03.960
And now I'll do this!

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:04.660
Waaahhh!!

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:06.600
Aaaahhh!

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.760
Ah! Aaaahhhh! Aaahhh!

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.500
I feel like I'm bumping into them myself, on my own account

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:12.340
How about like that?

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:14.720
I think I can do it! I can do it! Just a bit more... more... more...!

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:15.840
Ah! I can do it!!

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:17.000
Very good!

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:19.540
I did it

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:21.020
And now?

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:22.320
“I heard a noise coming from the hallway"

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:22.980
Oh, oh

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:26.320
And now?

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:27.820
Hmm...?

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:31.160
A slide!

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:33.060
I’ll go down!

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.920
And now?

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:37.620
It's locked with a key?

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:39.060
Eh?

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:40.640
And here?

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:42.420
I came from here? Here!

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:45.980
It's moving! It's too suspicious! It's very suspicious!

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:47.760
I'll burn it

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:51.500
Would it explode when it's finished?

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:52.580
Of course not, right?

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:54.840
Yes, onward with the news

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:55.340
[ This morning, on the metro highway, a cargo truck caused a fire due to it suddenly exploding ]

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:56.320
Oohh...
[ This morning, on the metro highway, a cargo truck caused a fire due to it suddenly exploding ]

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:57.520
[ This morning, on the metro highway, a cargo truck caused a fire due to it suddenly exploding ]

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.940
Was it the vehicle the parents were on?
[ This morning, on the metro highway, a cargo truck caused a fire due to it suddenly exploding ]

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:00.540
[ The cause of it is being investigated, although it's likely that the fire was caused by the truck ]

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:01.820
I definitely don't think it's like that, right?
[ The cause of it is being investigated, although it's likely that the fire was caused by the truck ]

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:03.240
[ It’s believed that the merchandise that the truck was carrying was the cause of the explosion ]

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:04.820
"...The merchandise that the truck was carrying was the cause of the explosion"
[ By the way, the following objects were found close to the explosion ]

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:05.960
[ By the way, the following objects were found close to the explosion ]

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:07.380
I'm sure it's the sticker!

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:11.120
I'm sure it's the sticker! You see!

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:15.540
Man! You see! I was sure that would happen!

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:17.780
Eh? I don't like that!

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:19.860
Aaahhh...

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:21.200
WHY!?

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:22.200
It’s absurd!!

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:25.100
I definitely don't plan on touching this flower

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:28.300
It's locked with a key?

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:31.700
I found the key!

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:34.480
And now...

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:37.460
Aaahhh...

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:40.240
Really... "aaahhh"!
[ It was blue, right? ]

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:41.900
"It was blue" It's true!

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:44.500
Ah, I need to do it one more time?

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:48.800
Eh?

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:51.040
Waaahh?

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:53.360
I wonder if I now have the key with me

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:54.800
Now...

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:57.380
Oh! It opened! It opened!

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:00.800
AAAAAAHHHH!

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:03.120
It's true, it's not a Earth globe, right?

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:05.740
Ma!! Pa!!

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:07.420
You’re a dangerous guy!

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:08.360
Eh?

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:09.480
That means that...

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:10.300
This!

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:13.080
This?

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:16.760
STOP FOOLING AROUND!!

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:18.160
This!

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:20.920
Is this a key?? (lol)

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:22.580
This is a key!?

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:28.180
Ah, what is this?

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:32.220
Aaaahh...

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:35.060
Really: "Aaaahh"!

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:36.940
What's the order in which I should press them?

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:39.500
Is there a clue some...?

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:42.320
Mmm...! Mmm...!

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:44.560
The clue for the order in which they should be pressed

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:46.600
Is it here?

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:48.500
Is it this? Is it like that?

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:49.720
Or maybe it's not related?

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:51.520
Eh? Do I try to press here to see what happens??

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:52.540
It's possible that...

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:54.880
…It's only pretending to be something safe, right?

00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:58.580
I knew it!!

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:00.400
Eeehhh?

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:05.260
Where is the hint at?

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:10.260
Hmm!

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:15.340
Ey!

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:18.180
Ah, you can undo though

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:20.300
Ah...

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:24.020
This is way too hard without a hint?

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:27.620
But there isn't one!

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:29.660
There is no hint?

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:30.460
Ah

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:33.700
There is one~!!

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:34.980
A

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:35.760

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:37.420

00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:38.100
E

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:38.720
F

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:39.440
G?

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:39.940
H

00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:41.640
I can do this

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:44.080
I can do this!

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:46.260
A

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:48.000

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:52.760

00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:55.560
F?

00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:57.700
G?

00:07:57.880 --> 00:07:58.560
H?

00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:02.900
I guess it was wrong~
