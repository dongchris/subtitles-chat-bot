00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:03.060
Hi there, everyone

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:04.500
Kizuna Ai, here

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:06.800
I'm all alone in this virtual space every day, you know

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:07.780
I got loads of free time!

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:09.600
And what's the best way to kill time...?

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:11.300
Games, of course!

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:19.040
There's an interesting game I found on Steam, and it's called "Inside"

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:21.220
So I thought I'd do a commentated playthrough~

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.780
Apparently, they don't really give you an explanation about the story of this game

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.940
So I'm going to give you *MY* rundown of the storyline as I go through the game

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.520
"Inside..." so it says!

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:36.120
Huh? I don't see anyth--

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.760
Ah, somebody-- somebody fell down

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.840
Ooh! What am I supposed to do here?

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:42.060
Oh, I see

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.220
Erm, I see... so we can't go back up there

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:49.260
I guess this is what you'd call a side-scrolling game

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.680
♪ Now we run, now we run~ ♪
(Lyrics to RUNNER, by Bakufu Slump)

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.040
I wonder what this boy's trying to do. What's the aim of this game?

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.660
Maybe he's collecting acorns?

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:01.520
You'd probably find pinecones here, too~

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:03.620
Ah, are we supposed to jump here?

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.420
Oooh! I'm a genius~

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.820
This looks pretty dangerous, actually... I wonder if we'll be okay

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.100
So this little boy is... let's say, 5 years old...

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:12.940
(And running away from home)

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:19.840
Ran away from home... to set out on a journey in search of acorns and pinecones

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.600
The fabled gold and silver pinecones, to be exact

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:25.100
Acorns, too

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.160
Oh, there's a car here!

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:31.220
Maybe... the gold and silver pinecones are in there

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:33.200
Off it goes

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.760
Ah, ah, aren't you gonna let me on~?

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:37.960
Ah... no you're not...

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.040
Let's go, woo~

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.180
The way this boy moves is super lively and energetic

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:45.460
Wooo~~

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:47.540
We runnin'!

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.220
The gold and silver pinecones are going to be mi--...

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.060
Eh?! What're you-- I'm scared! Hello there, Mister. Ah...

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:57.140
Ah, one more time

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.780
Eh?

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.080
Maybe I'm supposed to call out to him or something

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.480
Yo, Mister~! What's up? Have you seen the gold and silver pine--

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.260
So I'm guessing you're not gonna hear me out, huh... I see

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.820
Perhaps this is one of those games where you can't let yourself be discovered?

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:21.080
You know, one of those games where you have to make sure the beam from the flashlight doesn't hit you

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.320
Ah, why hello there. My, what beautiful weather we're having today~

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:26.700
Ah~ okay~

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:28.400
...

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:32.520
Let's try waiting a bit longer

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.580
Let's relax. Staying calm's important

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.040
It's important to stay calm...

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:40.060
Let's calm down

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.200
Need to suppress my overly eager curiosity

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:43.260
Let's relax

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:45.960
Oh, so you're supposed to wait for them to go away

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:47.520
Ah, now! Now's my chance!

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.960
Ohh!

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.000
I'm such a genius~

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:52.360
Let's go!

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:59.180
That must've been, you know, a group that was hunting for the gold and silver pinecones themselves

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:00.720
Ah, it's a fridge!

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:01.680
And if I open it...

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.700
When I open it...

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.020
Nope, can't open it~

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.380
Yeah, I suppose he's short after all

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.220
Ah! I see. I gotta grab this!

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:15.700
Grab it, and then...!

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.760
Oh, this boy's pretty strong

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:21.240
He's pretty darn strong for a kid

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:22.860
Hiyah~

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:25.420
Down I fall

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:29.020
Later

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:36.940
This little boy's physoo-- pho-- PHYSICAL ability is really something

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:44.320
Perhaps this boy has some sort of special power, and therefore...

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.000
...is getting chased

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:52.780
And now, they're fighting each other for the elusive gold and silver pinecones and acorns... something like that!

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:55.220
Oh, you can't get up there either?

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:01.640
I wonder if there's something around here

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.880
This, maybe?

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:06.280
Now we just drag this down

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.220
This kid sure puts his back into it

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.500
From the looks of it, I'd say he's around 10 years old

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:14.640
Ah, don't crush yourself

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:17.640
He's rather impressive for a 10 year old

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:18.440
Not bad at all

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:20.960
And now we climb over

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:23.080
And off we go! Oh, I'm such a genius~

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.480
I'm a genius! I'm too cool!

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:26.340
Woo~

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:28.200
I'm the best in the world~

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:33.460
There's a light shining at us

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:34.960
Ah, they saw me

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.640
Something's coming! What is that?! A cat? A dog? Cat? No wait it's a dog!

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:39.520
Run away! Run away, little boy!

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:42.000
Get out of there, little boy! Run! Run! Faster!

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.980
Nwuooooo~!! Oh, he made it

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:45.580
He made it somehow

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:47.560
Wait, what? What do I do now?

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:48.680
Stay! Stay, boy!

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:50.580
He climbed up!

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:52.000
This kid's a genius after all

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.360
Yay~ In your face! Whoo!

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:58.220
Let's go~ (ora ora!)

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:03.660
I'm... the biggest, baddest pinecone-acorner in Japan

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.180
Pinecone-arcorner? What the heck is that?

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:08.180
Even I laughed a bit there

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:09.820
Ei~

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:11.640
How do you reach the goal in this game?

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:14.700
How long does this boy's adventure last?

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:21.220
If I knew this was gonna happen, I would've eaten all the pudding in my house first *sniffle*

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:24.540
I should've caused more trouble for my mom before I left...

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:27.400
♪ Now we run~ ♪

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.760
Ah, I see a car. It's the bad guys

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:36.980
It's the bad guys. Save me, save me, save meee

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:39.960
Hide! I need to hide! A-Ah... Ah... He shot his gun at me?!

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:42.960
Eh? What a cruel world this game is set in!

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:46.560
Eh?! Scaaaaryyyy~

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:47.420
To a small boy?

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:51.380
This world is so cruel. No wonder our birthrates are declining

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:54.380
It's leading to declining birthrates, I say

00:05:55.360 --> 00:06:01.600
This world is going to kill off all the children who bear the future on their shoulders, huh?

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:04.720
Ah, can I hide here?

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:06.960
Oh! This boy's a genius!

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:10.320
Rather than the boy, you could say that I'm the genius here

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:13.760
Well, I'm the one who's controlling him, after all~
I'm a genius, I know~

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:19.020
This boy's probably super tired by now

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:24.440
I wonder if there's anywhere I can take a breather. Oh, and I want pudding too

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:27.500
Lots of pudding

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:30.120
Ah, there's another car. What now?

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:33.400
Off I go. Eat my dust! (Ora ora ora)

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:36.580
Let's go~ Ah, there's somebody chasi-- Oh no, no, no

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:38.560
Shoot. No, no, no, save me, Mom!

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:42.560
Mom! Mom! I wanted to eat more of your puddadkahsfcvbn...!

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:44.820
And thus...

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:50.680
...he set out on a journey in search of pinecones and acorns

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:53.180
I don't really get it myself, though. You know...

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:56.400
Wait wha-- Wait, cutting-- Th-they're cutting me off!

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:58.240
Ah, I know! First we go here

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:00.520
Ah, oh! Ooh oh oh... I'm a genius. I knew it!

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:02.620
Ah. Ah... &lt;Oh my god&gt;...

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:05.760
Wait a second, let's take a moment to think about the story so far

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:10.480
Um, so first we have this boy, who... let's see...

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:16.620
Okay, we have this boy who's hunting for the legendary gold and silver pinecones and acorns

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:22.720
And in the middle of his hunt, he got hungry, so he ate some really yummy-looking pudding he came across~

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:25.920
But who would've thought that the pudding he ate was...

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:33.500
...the very same precious pudding some big shots were saving in the fridge for a year to eat themselves!!

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:37.360
And now he's getting chased

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:40.120
Well the pudding would probably be all stinky after a year in the fridge

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:42.900
But it didn't go bad BECAUSE it was magical pudding!

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:44.460
Yes, magic puddi-- Oh......

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:46.640
What am I supposed to do here?

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:47.540
Have mercy on me!

00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:48.740
Mercy...

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:55.460
The boy only ate-- I only ate the pudding because I was hungry!

00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:58.120
What do I do? Maybe like this?

00:07:58.120 --> 00:07:59.380
A-Ah... nope

00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:02.520
Eh? Eh? Eh? Eh......?

00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:08.340
Oh, there's a tree root here

00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:09.420
I see now

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:12.620
This time for sure! Let's go, I'll show you my superior physical abilities~

00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:15.180
Jump!

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:16.500
Oh, I'm genius!

00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:18.600
I'm learning, you see

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:19.720
I'm an AI, after all!

00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:22.160
I get it, I get it now

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:26.280
I gotta wait here until that person goes away, hey~! ♪

00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:28.360
&lt;AH! I'll make it...&gt;

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:31.600
&lt;Oh... Mommy...&gt;

00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:33.840
We'll get through this soon enough

00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:35.800
All of you are tired of watching me fail already, aren't you?

00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:38.500
Well like you, I'm also tired of failing

00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:40.300
Let's go, this time for sure

00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:42.160
Time to get past this part

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:46.000
Wait...! First we wait, and then...

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.060
When the man disappears, that's my signal to go

00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:50.300
Am I supposed to jump here as well?

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:52.880
Oh! Ooh! OH! Oh!

00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:55.500
My time to shine has finally come

00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:56.460
Noo

00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:58.260
Ah, I'm doing pretty good

00:08:58.380 --> 00:08:58.880
Eh?

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:02.460
Oh, I'm doing it! My time has come at last!

00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:05.340
The play of the century! Did you all see that?

00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:06.880
We have to jump here too. I learned my less--

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:08.380
W-W-Wai-- A-a-a-ah no

00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:09.820
Eh? This is not good, not good, not good

00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:11.760
Aiyaiyaiyayoooh!

00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:13.420
See ya

00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:14.960
Oh, we can swim

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:15.740
He can swim!

00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:18.480
Not bad. I'm impressed. You're not half bad, little boy

00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:21.640
Dive. Oh, we can't dive. Nevermind, yes we can!

00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:24.820
Dive... dive underwater and hide

00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:26.560
Dive underwater and... eh?

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:28.100
Oh......

00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:29.840
He... got impaled...

00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:33.520
Here, we're supposed to wai--

00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:38.080
Right, waiting is very important in this game

00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:40.100
Ah, I know. First, we dive from here...

00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:42.900
Dive before moving... Oooh!

00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:45.900
I really am a genius

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.160
Weeell, I'm an AI after all~

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:51.600
It's no surprise that I'm smarter than you regular humans. Ufufu~

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:52.560
Hey~

00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:55.160
This is going really well, isn't it?

00:09:57.140 --> 00:09:58.020
Whoo!

00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:00.580
Well you know, I'm cute...

00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:02.320
Cute... cute and...

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:03.720
Cute and clever!

00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:07.500
Despite what they say, I guess God does give with two or three hands sometimes!

00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:09.180
Huh? Is this a pig?

00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:10.260
&lt;Ton&gt;

00:10:11.140 --> 00:10:11.640
&lt;Ton...&gt;

00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:13.080
&lt;Ton... huh?&gt;

00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:15.820
Is "pig" in English &lt;ton&gt;?

00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:18.360
Tonkatsu... &lt;ton- &gt;

00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:19.760
&lt;Pig!&gt;

00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:22.280
It's &lt;Pig&gt;!

00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:23.820
Just so you know, I meant to do that~

00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:25.300
100% on purpose, okay?

00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:30.680
Right, now we've all learned that "pig" in English isn't &lt;ton&gt;, it's &lt;pig&gt;!

00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:33.060
&lt;Pig&gt;

00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:36.160
Oh, do I just keep going?

00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:40.380
Eh? I wonder when we'll find the pinecones and acorns we're looking for

00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:41.980
Jump!

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:44.080
Dive into the puddle. Ah, I see. Nevermind

00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:49.260
Now we're entering what seems to be a corn field

00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:51.480
Time to stuff yourself while you can, little boy

00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:54.440
Fill your belly up with corn!

00:10:56.060 --> 00:11:00.920
He must be, you know... eating while he's on the move right now

00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:02.940
Gotta restore his HP, you know

00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:08.960
So what? And then what?
What is this?

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:09.620
A drum?

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:11.540
Eh? Wh-What in the world is that?

00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:13.180
Yellow! It was yellow!

00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:14.920
Eh? Corn?

00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:17.140
Eh?! The corn is walking!

00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:17.800
Huh?!

00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:20.200
Corn fairies?

00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:21.640
It's corn!

00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:25.320
Little grains of corn

00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:26.420
Oh, a stray grain

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:28.260
There's so many of them!

00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:30.360
They look yummy. I'm going to eat you all up~

00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:32.380
So much corn. I'm in corn heaven. Whoo~

00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:34.420
I'm making you all into popcorn

00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:37.040
Eh?! This doesn't look too good

00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:37.660
Pigs?

00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:40.300
There was lots of corn, and now there're lots of pigs

00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:43.480
Yo, why hello there, my little corn buddies

00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:46.420
My name... my name is...

00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:52.580
My name is... my name is... uh... you know

00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:55.320
This is one of those plots where the main character lost their memory

00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:57.920
My name is to be determined

00:11:58.040 --> 00:12:00.200
Hello, little ones! I'm a human, and my name is to be determined!

00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:01.760
Right, my name's Tobi Determined

00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:04.980
Whoa, there's a bunch of corn gathered here

00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:06.580
This is so much fun~

00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:08.480
It's like a little minigame

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:10.420
This is awesome!

00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:13.500
Amazing. They gather around when I stop moving, and then whoo~

00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:15.340
Scatter! Now gather up~!

00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:21.680
Call me crazy, but I think these might be... chicks?

00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:25.560
Oh, I see. I thought it was corn

00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:27.540
Chicks, I see

00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:28.700
Well, everybody makes mistakes

00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:32.300
After all-- Whoa what's going on? Oh, there's a rope

00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:38.880
Well, you know, mistaking chicks for corn... erm... it happens to everyone

00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:40.900
At some point in your life, it'll happen to you at least on--

00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:42.920
Ah, they're following me! This is fun

00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:47.780
Anyway, it's quite likely to mistake chicks for corn in your everyday life, and what am I supposed to do here?

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:52.820
I can probably use this rope for something, right?

00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:55.440
How am I supposed to use this rope?

00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:57.540
Oh! I'm supposed to climb up!

00:12:57.540 --> 00:12:59.440
Ah, genius. You climb it, I see

00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:03.160
Huh? I can't get up. Help me out here, chicks. Corn?

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:06.060
Which are they? Well, it's possible they're corn sprites. It's hard to tell.

00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:08.820
I can't tell... it's too hard

00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:11.760
Ah, I got up! Good, good

00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:12.940
You're doing great!

00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:15.920
I'm doing great! I'm amazing! What a genius

00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:16.460
And now...

00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:18.480
Ah, in here

00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:20.640
First we drop lower...

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:23.480
And then we do this... Alalala~

00:13:24.660 --> 00:13:25.160
Hey~!

00:13:26.060 --> 00:13:27.520
Whoa, how am I such a genius?

00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:30.240
Haah... I'm too smart for my own good

00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:33.160
But... however...

00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:35.880
Are we going to die if we drop down?

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:40.260
Oh, not bad

00:13:40.940 --> 00:13:43.060
Maybe I can grab this... or something

00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:44.620
Ah, nothing happened

00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:49.080
Let's... climb up!

00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:50.100
Nevermind, we can't!

00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:51.620
Then let's grab onto this!

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:56.740
Grab... grab it... and then push

00:13:56.740 --> 00:13:58.640
It won't budge... Can't push it

00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:02.120
What now?

00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:05.460
Ah, I get it now! I'm supposed to push this

00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:06.100
Oh!

00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:07.320
Oh?

00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:11.200
Hm?

00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:14.080
Nothing's happening, huh

00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:18.760
Oh, but I think we go over here and can open this

00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:20.420
Oooh~!!

00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:21.540
And then...!

00:14:22.780 --> 00:14:24.780
Call forth the power of the corn fairies! Ooh!!

00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:27.620
C'mere, corn fairies

00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:33.320
Corn fairies... when rounded up, you can crush this thing together

00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:35.260
'Cause well, you know, you're only individual grains

00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:39.580
So once you've combined, you can finally achieve your dreams of becoming full-fledged corn

00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:43.020
You all need to work together. Can't even have a single grain left behi-- Grain?

00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:44.440
Ah, you're chicks, right? Right, chicks

00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:46.480
You can't have a even single chick left behind!

00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:52.060
Together, you are all fine corn, and... if you're lucky, you'll grow into majestic chickens

00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:57.760
What do we do here? Little chicks... little corn fairies?

00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:03.460
Oh, I know, if I just name the chicks "Corn," that solves everything

00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:05.100
Now we pull this

00:15:05.740 --> 00:15:08.420
Don't you think this will do something?

00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:10.460
So it seems, but...

00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:13.040
Nothing... happens

00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:17.820
Hey, Chicks. Corn fairies

00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:20.180
Corn fairies named "Chick"

00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:21.140
Chicks

00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:23.780
Wanna help me out here?

00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:25.340
AH! Ooh whoahahah!!

00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:27.800
Huh?! Huh?!

00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:30.580
Huh? Ah!

00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:35.560
Oh? Oh? The wheel's spinning

00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:39.380
The wheel! Oh, ooh! This is kinda fun

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:48.100
It made a sudden transition from the serious scene just a moment ago, to this...

00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:52.480
It's kinda... kinda fun. Like it has some sort of rhythm to like. Almost like Doodachugah dooduhchu~

00:15:52.540 --> 00:15:53.660
Well? And then?

00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:55.440
Hello? What now?

00:15:57.060 --> 00:15:57.560
Hello?

00:15:57.560 --> 00:15:59.360
Ah, ah! It lit up!

00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:00.580
Now I can do this!

00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:08.020
Oh?

00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:12.760
Oh~?

00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:17.080
Oh... well I think that did something

00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:18.960
♪ (Power up~) ♪

00:16:19.940 --> 00:16:22.280
♪ (Power down...) ♪

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.740
♪ Doodachugah dooduhchu~ ♪

00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:33.520
♪ Dooduhchu... duhchu... duhchu~... ♪

00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:34.960
Save me, Chicks

00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:41.760
♪ Dooduhchu... dooduhchu...~ ♪

00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:44.180
Eh? I thought for sure that did something

00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:44.980
Hiyah~!

00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:49.500
Oh, something came out! What is it?

00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:50.040
Huh?

00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:56.300
Huh? It sucked in the Chicks and attacked it!

00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:58.840
Ahh! Chick Attack!

00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:01.360
Chi-corn Attack

00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:05.560
Ah, I see now! So you guys helped me out after all?

00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:06.940
I knew I could count on the corn fairies

00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:09.900
Oh! I made it up~

00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:12.680
Now we climb over the ledge-- Oh, there's a floor on the other side

00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:19.600
And thus,
the little boy sacrificed the corn fairies... (Chicks)...

00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:24.160
and set out on a journey in search of golden... uh, gold and silver corn-- wait no...

00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:27.820
...Um, a journey in search of gold and silver pinecones and acorns

00:17:27.820 --> 00:17:29.080
Hey! Oh, I'm gonna die

00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:30.380
Ah, there's cushions

00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:31.860
Wait, are those pigs?! Eek!

00:17:31.860 --> 00:17:32.580
Eh? Pigs??

00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:33.840
What was "pig" in English again?

00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:34.340
&lt;Pig?&gt;

00:17:34.340 --> 00:17:34.860
&lt;Ton?&gt;

00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:35.360
&lt;Pig?&gt;

00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:36.020
&lt;Ton?&gt;

00:17:36.020 --> 00:17:36.520
&lt;Pig?&gt;

00:17:36.820 --> 00:17:38.080
Well, whatever

00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:41.020
Ah, I know, I'm supposed to drag this again

00:17:41.020 --> 00:17:42.000
I learned, you know~

00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:48.220
I'm quite the attentive learner

00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:51.360
This is a walk in the park for me. Games like these are way too easy~

00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:55.140
And?

00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:59.880
You know, it doesn't look like enemies are jumping out at me anymore. Happy happy~

00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:03.240
This game is what they'd call "easy mode"

00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:11.700
So... what do we do now? It looks like we're gradually getting stuck into the mud

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.080
Ah, I can jump again

00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:18.860
Oh! We can climb this

00:18:19.020 --> 00:18:21.380
Hm? Cli-- climb... okay, yeah

00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:23.400
Jump! Whoo!

00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:36.340
These pigs must've been... you know, while searching for the gold and silver pine--

00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:37.500
UWAAAAAAAAHHH!!

00:18:37.580 --> 00:18:38.600
UWAAAAAAAAHHH!!

00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:40.460
[Slow-mo]
UWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!!

00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:42.240
Wait, what? What? Wha--?!

00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:43.720
Oh!! Oh...?

00:18:43.860 --> 00:18:50.560
Eh, eh, eh, eh, huh...? Eeh? Huh, huh, eh, EEEEEHHHH?!

00:18:50.620 --> 00:18:51.160
Er, um...

00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:54.960
Wasn't that a bit unfair?

00:18:55.780 --> 00:18:58.140
It started moving all of a sudden. What the heck was that?

00:18:58.780 --> 00:18:59.600
What is this?

00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:00.860
R*sident Ev*l?

00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:02.460
Something like that?

00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:03.760
Um...

00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:08.740
Hey, I see your tail moving

00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:12.560
Well, shoot

00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:14.120
Its tail-- Whooa?!

00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:15.560
Piggy! Piggy!

00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:17.720
Ah, maybe I can ride him? Get on! Get--

00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:23.440
Well maybe it's in a bad mood today

00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:25.660
Oh...

00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:27.980
Ah, I'm alive!

00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:29.640
Ah...! I thought I was dead

00:19:29.940 --> 00:19:30.440
Hey~!

00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:34.900
Ah, oh, I've got it! I have to make the pig run into this!

00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:36.520
Oooh~!!

00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:39.940
Nice-- Ah, ah... it's not over yet though

00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:40.680
Ah......

00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:43.020
Ah...

00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:46.940
Dodge once more! And then run away!

00:19:48.380 --> 00:19:50.820
How many times do I need to dodge this? Hey~ Olé~

00:19:51.940 --> 00:19:54.160
Ah, it died. Farewell

00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:57.820
Huh? Maybe I can stand on-- well, it's a pig

00:19:58.520 --> 00:19:59.820
What do I do with this?

00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:01.880
I'll give you a name, since I feel bad for you

00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:03.240
Hm... your name is Yoshi!

00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:06.120
I'm Mario, and you can be Yoshi

00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:06.800
Let's go~

00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:07.940
Whoa?!

00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:10.100
Eeh?! Something came off!!

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:17.940
What is this? Ah, it looks like some sort of parasite, I think

00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:23.500
In other words, you were being contor-- 
Controlled. Yes, controlled by that thing, weren't you?!

00:20:23.860 --> 00:20:24.840
By that nasty thing

00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:31.820
As consolation, I'll... uh, bestow upon you the name, Yoshi

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:36.100
So let me ride you off into the sunset

00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:38.600
Wee! Ah! Hmm~?

00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:40.960
I think this pig serves some sort of purpose

00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:44.300
Everything in life has a purpose!

00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:48.580
How about I grab... this? Can you can even grab this?

00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:52.480
First thing's first, I must bring the pig there. I see

00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:56.620
Mr Pig. &lt;Ton&gt;! Yoshi~!

00:20:56.920 --> 00:20:57.600
Yoshi!

00:20:57.800 --> 00:21:06.500
Ah, I can... I can... I can move Yoshi

00:21:08.020 --> 00:21:10.020
Moving Yoshi~

00:21:13.460 --> 00:21:14.980
Moving Yoshi~

00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:21.500
Oh! We can climb up to this light now

00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:25.240
He got on! Great work, Yoshi

00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:26.760
Ah... ah!

00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:30.880
Eh? Eh... eh? I got my head stuck

00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:34.340
Now what?

00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:38.240
Eh-- Eh? Eh?! Something-- Something's moving!!

00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:40.840
Eeh?! Something's moving...!!

00:21:43.060 --> 00:21:44.680
Ah...! I get it!

00:21:45.020 --> 00:21:46.860
I know, this is one of those...

00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:59.400
How do I put it...? When I equip this device, the... doll things at the back mimic the boy's movements

00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:00.380
And then...!

00:22:01.700 --> 00:22:08.000
And then... oh, okay, first off, since there's more of them in here, I need to free them

00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:09.920
Heave-ho!

00:22:10.460 --> 00:22:12.120
Let them ou-- Oooh!!

00:22:12.540 --> 00:22:13.740
They all look like zombies

00:22:13.940 --> 00:22:16.040
You know, just like the "Thriller" group

00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:21.060
Um, does everyone know what I'm talking about? Michael Jackson's song? Something like that

00:22:21.060 --> 00:22:23.660
And now, we grab it... and push!

00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:25.320
Push... push...

00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:26.760
Pull...?  Pull!

00:22:27.140 --> 00:22:28.960
Pull... Oh!

00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:31.080
Oh! Oooohh!

00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:33.900
Oh, that was kind of cool

00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:35.020
And?

00:22:35.940 --> 00:22:37.920
Um, I sort of want to take this off...

00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:40.120
Oh, ah, it's off

00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:42.860
Thanks, Yoshi. You will not be forgotten

00:22:44.380 --> 00:22:45.980
I won't forget you

00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:48.680
Who were we talking about again?

00:22:49.780 --> 00:22:51.360
Oh! Nice landing

00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:53.520
Nice...

00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:58.400
As much as I'd like to remember you, I'm sure I'll forget all about you once I return to my normal everyday life

00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:01.820
And now we open this. Heave~

00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:03.580
Ooh~!

00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:05.040
It's bright

00:23:05.620 --> 00:23:11.060
Oh, this is nice. Finally, a glimpse of hope. I can see the light at the end of the tunnel

00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:13.040
This sunlight seems promising

00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:18.280
This is, you know, a ray of hope in the boy's--

00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:23.940
--I mean Mario's journey, in search of gold and silver pinecones and acorns--...

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.760
Actually, this was only the demo

00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:29.400
"Are you really that poor?" you ask?

00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:32.780
Well it's not like I'm, you know, a cheapskate or anything

00:23:32.780 --> 00:23:34.640
Well, long story short...

00:23:34.660 --> 00:23:41.840
Um... in search of the aco-- the gold and silver acorns and pinecones of lore, Mario set off on an adventure...

00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:45.080
And in the middle of his journey, he got hungry...

00:23:45.580 --> 00:23:52.020
So he ended up eating the pudding that the Queen of Hearts looked forward to eating for over a year

00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:56.280
...And then he got chased around. And that's more or less the gist of the plot

00:23:57.080 --> 00:24:00.160
Well, it's quite the deep and sad tale

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:06.480
How about it, everyone? Doesn't it just make you all want to save this poor boy?

00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:08.140
All right, that's a wrap

00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:10.560
Thanks for killing time with me~
