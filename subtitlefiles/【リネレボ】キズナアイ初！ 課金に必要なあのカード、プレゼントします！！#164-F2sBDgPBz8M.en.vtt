00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.160
Hello everyone! Virtual Youtuber Kizuna Ai here!

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:06.000
Am I not also a YouTuber?

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:07.460
And, having said that, it's finally here

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:08.360
Here I go

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:09.800
REALLY!

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:11.940
Please, ready your ears and listen

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:13.200
Here I go, everyone

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:13.940
Shh...

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:16.080
The first A.I.Channel...

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.020
Ah, can't you hear me?

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.040
THE FIRST A.I.CHANNEL...

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:22.700
...100 thousand yen valued iTunes Card giveaway!

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:24.940
Yay~

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.880
Well...

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.820
You might think that it's not much, but...

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:29.700
After all, I...

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:30.340
Like Hi*ru...

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:31.420
Ra*ael...

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:33.140
*meshachou...

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:34.760
“For*den boys”...

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.120
And Hi*kin...
(They are all YouTubers)

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.220
Or something like that, right?

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:39.220
And other names that play Splatoon...

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:40.020
Like PS4...

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.000
Who have given out many tens of prizes...

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.100
In however many million yen...

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.620
But, what about if I give away iTunes cards?

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.420
It might not be much if you compared it to the other prices, but...

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.300
I count on all of you!

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.660
Ya! So that's what has been decided so far!

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:55.660
However... well...

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:57.560
It might not be as bulky as you were all thinking, however...

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.600
That is why... truly...

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.860
Because it's a small amount out of my pocket…

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:02.460
*inhales*

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:04.080
I squeezed it out!

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.100
Please accept my 100,000 yen!

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.960
For everyone's sake... for the sake of the view count...

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:10.680
It's a win-win

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.380
This is it, a win-win!

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:13.940
The objective of a win-win, is to win-win!

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.135
Now, I will explain the essential entry process!

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.440
This time, it's my first iTunes Card present!

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.120
So it may be asking a lot...

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:24.420
But please do this!

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:25.680
There are two ways to enter!

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.060

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:30.580

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.640
So please make sure to subscribe!

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:44.600

So leave your passionate responses there!

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.520
If you want an iTunes Card...

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.620
Please write down your feelings for me... and send them!

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:53.200
I remind you that...

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.140
I will use YouTube's comment feature to contact you...

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.740

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.860
So you can receive messages from the Top Page

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:05.020
If you don't understand, Google it...

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:06.920
And then, next, Twitter!

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.460
One, follow my Twitter! Please!

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:12.820
I can't send messages here either, so please!

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:17.520
Next, I'll make a tweet about the draw

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.140
So please like and retweet!

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.840
I remind you that...

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.340
I want a lot of people to enter...

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:29.720
So I’d be happy if you hyped it up with the hashtag #AiChans100000Yen!

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:31.820
Entries end two weeks from today!

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:36.160
Whichever way you enter, I'll contact you to notify you if you win!

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.280
If you aren't contacted... I'm very sorry!

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.220
Now, the "Final entry condition!"

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.900
Watch this video until the end ♡

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:50.640
If you say "Lineage 2," I think there are a lot of people familiar with it!

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:56.460
And, regarding “Lineage 2”, it’s being released newly as a mobile game!

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:57.440
Yaaaay!

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:01.140
So to speed things up and play the game sooner...

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.560
I'd like to introduce everyone!

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.360
You're probably jealous, aren't you? Mhm...

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.480
Ja-jan! It's the character!

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:08.340
Whoo!

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.360
How cute… I'm rotating the camera

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.035
I'm disappointed with the underpants, since...

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.260
You can’t see them, but that’s healthier

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.140
And her weapon, it's fluffy!

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:17.700
Amazing, it's pretty good

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.720
I can also change her outfit

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:20.400
Ja-jan!

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:22.120
Her twintails are cute!

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.380
Ah! She's really, really jumping a lot!

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.460
Eh? Her movement is somewhat cute!

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.220
You're laughing a lot, aren't you?!

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:33.340
Cute, but...

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.360
It kind of feels strange, the way she moves, she's cute

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.520
This game has an MMO feel to it and...

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:42.940
You receive the quests and then clear them

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:44.800
The basic flow would be...

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.260
Now that we started playing...

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:48.980
I'll try out several dungeons....

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:51.460
And everyone will see what the game is like!

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:52.040
Hoi!

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:53.420
The Tower of Pride

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.400
The reason I’m starting at the 24th floor is because...

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.780
Well~! If it’s the first floor...

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:03.320
I’m too strong and it won’t show the gameplay!

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:11.560
*The Tower of Pride = An important dungeon with the drop “Rune fragment” with can strengthen the character's status*

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:12.120
Soiya!

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.860
Fight!

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:19.240
Good! Gah!

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.760
Don't come here! Don't come here! Don't!

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:24.140
This is, you know... I'm happy, but...

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:26.160
There’s no locked controls
*Point: There's no locked controls*

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.340
So you can go without restraint

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:31.980
I’m bad with… ah, they’re beating me, they're beating me

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:33.460
I’m bad with locked controls, so...

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:35.480
By the way...

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:39.860
I am strong so... the monster too, which I'm going to defeat, but...

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:46.020
*Point: When you defeat the boss, even if there are small enemies left, the quest is clear*

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:46.680
Oh!

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:48.880
That was so easy

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:52.320
Ja-jan!

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:55.340
Yay! That's how you do it right!

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:01.380
And now we're here

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:02.920
Although there is a limited time
*Time limit*

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:08.260
"If you don't clear all waves in time...

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.780
Or your character gets killed...

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:12.300
It will be considered as a loss"

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:18.700
"And then when you lose, you won't be able to enter the same level again that day"

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:20.460
That's why...

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:21.640
You should...

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:23.980
Fight carefully...

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:25.860
Against monsters, right?

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:28.120
What's this? It's cute...
*Black Forest Hound*

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:32.220
The belly of the doggie looks so flappy

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:33.280
AHH! NOOO!

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:35.460
Eh?

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:37.900
Isn't this belly super cute?

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:39.480
It’s so flappy...

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:44.120
Well, that was easy

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:45.860
I'm happy that the win was quick

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.140
The attack...

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:48.880
How do I say it?

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:51.000
It's not the posture of her attack...

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:53.500
It's the movement when she attacks, it looks cute, right?

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:56.120
Like skipping around rotating...

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:57.480
Just now...

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:59.660
Although it was a boss... it felt like a weak boss

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:01.140
Since we've started...

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:03.800
Don't you want to see a huge boss?

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:04.660
In this case!

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:05.460
♪ Te, ren! ♪

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:08.180
I would like to challenge... the Adena Dungeon!

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:11.040
In the Adena Dungeon, your reward changes...

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:13.220
Depending on your combo count and...

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:15.220
The boss's remaining HP...

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:17.120
So now let's go!

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:22.440
Okay

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:26.080
Here I go

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:29.640
By the way, untiI I attack it, it can't...

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:31.000
Attack...

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:31.960
That's great

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:33.900
I can observe it closely

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:35.460
Incredible! It's golden!

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:37.680
Seems strong... can I win?

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:40.080
Well... I can do it!

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:41.620
Ahh!

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:45.320
But wait, everyone... don't worry...

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:47.260
I can cheat

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:50.340
Although...

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:52.080
‘Cause its me...

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:54.200
Being this strong

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:56.580
I won't die like usual!

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.100
I mean my gear is...

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:01.700
Too strong for this, right?

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:04.040
I can just say “Ho ho ho”!
(acting tough)

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:05.960
Ooo-yaaah!

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:11.160
Ah, wait, wait... I'm out of MP... I'm out of MP as a matter of fact

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:16.640
But, you know, my equipment is way too strong...

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:19.440
But my normal attacks are really strong too!

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:22.080
Oya, oya!

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:26.360
Soiya!

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:27.800
My MP isn't enough...

00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:30.460
Ahh, what does this mean?!

00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:33.940
Sei!

00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:38.920
Oh! We've already gotten about halfway... this looks bad...

00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:41.940
Seiya, soiya!

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:47.260
Eh? Ah, I got scared...

00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:49.340
I definitely won't die, right?

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:51.740
Stop, please!

00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:54.800
Okay!

00:07:57.300 --> 00:08:00.160
The animations of this spinning and hitting attack...

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:02.200
Are really amazing...

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:07.040
Yes, even if you breathe fire, I won't get roasted!

00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:10.320
I don't have enough MP!

00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:15.520
Ah, I cleared it! I won!

00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:18.960
Look at me! I got a triple S!

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:21.440
It was an easy win, wasn't it?

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:24.360
Also, even though I can't do it now, but... Chan!

00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:26.260
There's what's called a 'Blood Oath...'

00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:27.620
A 'Guild', so to speak!

00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:31.700
As you enter 'Blood Oaths,' the number of dungeons you can challenge increase!

00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:35.180
If you play Lineage 2, we can work together! Isn't that nice?

00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:36.800
But, despite that...

00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:37.940
Well, you know...

00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:42.040
It's incredible that a mobile phone game looks so beautiful

00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:44.000
But then, really, these movements…

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:44.860
This, this...!

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:47.800
You spin around like 'SPWAN'! This attack...

00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:49.500
The attack animations are...

00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:50.460
Unbearably good, right?

00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:54.160
Just like an MMO... because there are so many mechanics...

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:57.120
It seems like it would be exciting to cooperate with everyone!

00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:01.820
By the way... the 'KizunaAi' on the 'Goddard' server is me!

00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:05.000
Because we won't be able to play together if you don't pick the same server... be careful!

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:09.360
It's true, it turns out, this server can get pretty crowded, so again, be careful!

00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:10.880
So everyone, please join as soon as possible!

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:14.480
Also, to everyone who was kind enough to watch this far...

00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:17.700
Thank you very much! I hope you can win my present! ♥

00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:20.860
And thanks to everyone from 'Lineage 2: Revolution!'
*Congratulations for 'Lineage 2'*

00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:23.520
Well then, this has been Virtual Youtuber Kizuna Ai!

00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:24.580
See you later!

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:28.840
