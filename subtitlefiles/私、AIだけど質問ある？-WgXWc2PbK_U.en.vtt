00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:02.260
Hi,

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:04.540
It's Virtual Youtuber, Kizuna Ai.

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:07.520
I've said it before, I am actually...

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:09.140
An AI!

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:13.400
When i mentioned AI, what did you think of?

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.480
I've introduced AIs like Siri and Rina,

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.520
They can understand speech, give replies, and join conversations

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.180
Although they tend to ignore me most of the time

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.440
anyhow, they are advanced technology

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.320
brand new! super advanced!

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:30.880
in other words, they are super smart!

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.200
of course, I'm pretty smart too

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:39.620
come to think of it, I haven't seen AI as advanced as me

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.900
that should go without question

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:48.140
at the very least, I can easily recall all the words from the dictionary

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:49.540
extraordinary brain and all

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:53.880
I'll let you witness my super intelligence

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.820
greetings, how are you?

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.380
I am the intelligent super AI, Kizuna Ai.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.800
right now, all of those words you often hear, but don't know the meaning of

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:09.300
will be explained by me

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:10.800
alright then

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:15.440
as usual, over there, we have a machine that dishonest people can't see

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.740
Random word picker!

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.420
I will now excellently explain the definition of whatever word that comes out.

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.500
(machine noise)(?)

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:27.140
chang!

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:28.580
the first word is....

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.340
AI!

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.440
a fitting question indeed!

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:34.080
alright

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.980
i'll quickly explain

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:36.100
AI stands for

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:37.800
artificial intelligence

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.320
something artificially created on a computer

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.220
to simulate human like intelligence

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.920
including all fundamental technology used to achieve that purpose.

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:51.020
by...

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.680
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:53.260
want it simpler?

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:54.740
then, in one word

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:55.680
me

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:56.740
onto the next word!

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.000
(processing.....)

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:58.680
(very loud onomatopoeia!)

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.480
con....

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:01.060
sen..

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.760
sus

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.440
consensus is...

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.000
plugging in...powercords!! (homophone in Japanese)

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.040
meh, too easy.

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.120
everyone got that? you all got that, right?

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.780
Consensus, plugging in power cords

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:19.140
yep, perfect

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.720
lets have a look at an example

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.020
ah, ne ne ne

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.960
could you consensus (plug in) that dryer for me?

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:28.620
perfect, yeah?

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.020
you guys can now use it in your every day lives

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:33.720
alright, moving on

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.940
(there's no way you can make this sound natural in english)

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:38.180
matter

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:39.380
matter is....

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.060
waiiiiiit (まった)

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.620
waiiiiiit (まった)'s

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:42.740
modern version

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.460
now, an example

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.320
that confession! matteeeerr (waiiiiit)!

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.460
alright, everyone got that?

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:58.580
when your lover decides to hook up or marry someone else

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.040
just use this phrase

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.380
next word, then

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:02.960
(the sound of a dropped frying pan)

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:05.980
FYI

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:07.140
sooooo

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.140
FYI means

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.920
a Secret Government Organization

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.200
appears in movies a lot

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.600
It stands for

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:17.820
Fairy Yellow Ice

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:18.820
 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:20.820
sounds yummy

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:22.560
now then

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:24.780
lets have a look at an example

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:26.640
I'm...

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:27.720
actually...

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.480
Being chased by the FYI

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:32.900
could you shelter me for a bit?

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:34.200
ಠ△ಠ

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:37.340
what a great example

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:39.920
now you'll be fine when they come after you

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.600
alright

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:41.260
(jumpcut)

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:42.240
Solution

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:43.340
Solution refers to

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:45.440
illusion from beard shaving (beard do) (shaving [剃る：soru]＋illusion)

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:48.800
every morning before dad goes to work

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:50.560
He'd get a solution (beard do)

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.560
lets look at an example

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:54.480
morning dad,

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.540
nice solution (beard do) this morning

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.880
and now dad's gonna be in a good mood too

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.040
now we're up to the last one

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:04.520
(machine noise)

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:05.140
(sound of banging a symbol against a baking tray)

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:09.020
well this is a pretty difficult one

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.140
evidence

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:12.280
evidence refers to

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:15.520
women living near Tokyo Ebisu station

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:18.220
isn't there a title called platinum women (is there?)

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:22.000
the Ebisu version of that would be evidence

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:23.940
shall we look at an example?

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.740
me?

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:26.860
i live in Ebisu

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:29.000
didn't you know? i'm an evidence (women living in etc etc.)

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:32.240
something like that

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:35.920
anyhow, after all that explaining

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:39.660
did i answer all of your questions?

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:46.100
I think you all know full well how smart i am now

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:52.700
if you have words you don't know and want me to explain them for you

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.760
don't be shy, just ask me in the comment section

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:59.380
and I'll answer them all

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:00.440
coz I'm a genius

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:02.060
alright

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:06.240
that's all for the intelligent super AI, Kizuna Ai
