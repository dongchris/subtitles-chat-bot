Hello everyone,
Kizuna Ai here!

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:05.540
Since it's December,

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:06.760
it's the season of love!

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:07.940
...at least it should be

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:10.140
But statistically, most of you

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:11.720
seems to be single!

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:12.640
Isn't this

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.240
I tried to think positively about this,

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.640
so it's actually

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.400
That person you're have interest on,

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:21.700
have a high probability 
of being single too, right?

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:23.180
Now with that chance,

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.360
when I looked up ways to make person
we like to fall on us,

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.200
I found this article online!

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:29.920
Make males fall on you

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:31.160
with 5 basic sentences!
(Sa Si Su Se So)

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:32.540
Do you viewers know?

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.380
I'll try using it, okay?

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:35.120
"Sa"!

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:37.500
"As expected from you!"

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:38.640
"Si"!

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.720
"I didn't know about that!"

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:42.360
"Su"!

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:44.700
"That's amazing!"

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:45.200
"Se"!

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.120
"You have nice sense!"

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.940
"So"!

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:51.080
"Oh is that so?"

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.360
This is all receiving ends, right?

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.920
With all the herbivore males now out there,

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:59.440
That kind of responses,

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.020
doesn't work against them,
don't you think?

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:01.980
So with that,

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.160
