00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:02.960
Hello there. It's Virtual YouTuber, Kizuna Ai.

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:05.480
In this season, filled with new beginnings,

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:09.040
people who will begin living alone from April onwards, are going to increase huh.

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:11.260
I too am living alone. or should I say..

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:13.920
I'm basically living alone forever...

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.700
In any case, have a look at this room.

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:18.060
Not even a television,

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:18.980
nor a radio.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.380
Without a door, not even furniture.

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.160
Hey, this room… su~cks!

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.200
Really sucks. Sucks.

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:29.700
See, I too would like to get on with this new season of life.

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:31.140
Now's the chance.

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.860
With that said, "from April onwards, I want to have a new lifestyle in this kind of room",

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.560
with this kind greed inside of me right now

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.560
I shall publicly reveal my ideal room.

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:39.400
but..

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.540
I'm not sure if these furniture really exists for sale

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.180
If its not for me, will you guys buy it?

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.540
probably not

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.960
Ok then, without further ado, let's draw Kizuna Ai's ideal room!

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.240
Let's go!

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:53.100
Firstly, we go with that thing right?

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.320
Thing called "layout" is important right? Layout.

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.860
Just one room is fine, though, better that it's nice and spacious, right?

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:03.780
First, lets have a Counter Kitchen

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.180
And a Refrigirator

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:10.980
and some kitchenware

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.940
here goes the counter

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.060
it's looking good

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:20.100
This time.. Looks like two are better..

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:26.420
and a sink which is wide

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:31.400
For the TV... around 60 inches would be ok

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:32.280
like this big!

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:33.360
like this?

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:34.300
then

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.400
let's put a big,round table

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:41.640
with a L shaped Sofa

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:44.800
Just like this...a L shaped

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:47.120
sofa

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.540
this is what I want!

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:56.920
and on this portion, lets put some floral plants over here

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.860
I definitely want a walk-in closet too

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.220
A big one just like this

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:13.280
the veranda should be over here but..

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.780
I also don't mind to have a small veranda, it might be good too

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.540
then

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.640
for the bed...

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.960
hmm

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.260
Bed will be here

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.400
and the shelf would be around here

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:36.360
then..

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.380
Ah! I forgot where to put the Computer (@_@)

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:43.100
I forgot to put the Computer station so..

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:47.220
Let's make the Walk-in closet smaller just like this

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.180
and have the Bed here

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.100
and here...

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.720
ww.. I really like the letter L like this..ww

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.780
so.... let's put 3 computer monitors

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.640
paired with a cool looking chair

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.280
well..as you all know me.. people might ask "aren't you artistic?"

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:29.420
Well then.. to make it "artistic".. I'll put a painting frame just like this even though I forgot what's it called

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:30.380
no... like this...

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:31.200
like this...

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:33.520
This ain't Tokyo Tower

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:38.520
I'll put this right here

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:41.480
A decorative painting

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:43.900
EH!?

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:45.500
That's it! I remember now..

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:47.160
ummm it's イーゼル (izeru)

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:49.460
As expected from a super genius AI like myself

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:51.660
then....

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:55.200
there seems to be something special lacking..

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:57.360
I have a counter kitchen...

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:00.860
AH!

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:01.360
I knew it..

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:12.380
If I get a cat or any pet..  I'd like to put a some sort of futon for them to rest in here

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:16.560
as for the space here....

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:22.580
I'd keep it simple and use this for filming

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:24.240
Rug mat

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:30.820
I'll have my video shoots here

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:32.900
So how is my room everyone?

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:34.080
It's perfect isn't it?

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:38.080
Can somebody provide a house like this? with around 10,000 yen rent per month.

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.120
Anyway.. with this we are complete!

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:42.640
Jaga Jaga JAN!

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:44.680
the charming point of this room

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:46.920
without a doubt it is the function of the room

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:50.380
It's not like.. it is only kawaii or something like that

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:52.240
It also gives you a very good impression of orderliness?

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:53.140
like

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:55.420
It does not give you a very stiff or inflexibility kind of impression

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.160
but gives you a little...

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:58.960
a little bit of..

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:00.840
energy in your everyday life

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:02.560
that welcoming type of home

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:04.600
the L shaped sofa of course itself

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:06.760
I want it so badly..like this..

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:10.480
Also cushion! I want some cushion! Let's draw some cushions here

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:12.380
A large one

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:14.680
How about a shower and a toilet?

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.340
I probably don't need neither of them, right?

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:20.360
I probably don't need a kitchen too if you ask me.

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:22.800
I do respect your opinion but..

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:25.520
doesn't a kitchen give you a feeling of yearning?

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:26.820
especially like a counter kitchen?

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:28.940
so let's just keep it, a counter kitchen!

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:30.900
What do you think?

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:33.120
I also left enough space for me to shoot my video

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:35.280
there are also enough space for me to use a computer

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:37.700
a bed as well..this is such an ideal room

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.200
that being said, I have expressed my ideal room to all you guys!

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:44.760
if you have great intuition, you probably understand, right?

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:48.720
Kawaii, clean, functional and soft!

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:51.360
I really want a bed like this!

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:52.600
oh!

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:53.720
eh?

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:55.000
did you hear something?

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:57.320
eh? did you hear me speaking?

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:59.840
oh snap! I spoke out my kokoro's voice by mistake

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:03.480
that being said, everyone who is ready to start a new life from April!

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:05.000
If you are feeling depressed,

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:07.880
make sure to check out A.I. Channel to cheer yourself up!

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:08.720
So, One last thing!

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:11.000
Virtual YouTuber, Kizuna Ai desu ta!!

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:11.780
Bye bye!~
