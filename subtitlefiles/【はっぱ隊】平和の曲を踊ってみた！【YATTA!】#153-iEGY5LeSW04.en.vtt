00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.800
Hello everyone! Virtual Youtuber Kizuna Ai here!

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:04.440
I know this is sudden...

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.500
But it's something I've always been thinking about...

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.000
This time, in all seriousness...

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.440
I want you to see what things I want to do, using this video

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:15.920
That is...

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.320
I want to make the world peaceful

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.580
Things like conflict and fighting...

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.420
Are things that humans do...

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:24.600
But it's a choice of the moment, isn't it?

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.640
Lot's of people watching understand this

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.000
I...

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.600
Can't fight physical battles...

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.080
Because I'm virtual

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.540
But after all, I believe that nothing can be born of violence!

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.560
This might seem like I’m too naive

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:42.940
I’ll bring peace to the world!

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.160
Even though this is something I want to do, I can't say it'll be easy...

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.660
Rather, I think it'll be hard...

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:52.560
But with such a large amount of people...

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.580
Who enjoy watching my videos...

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:59.680
I want as many people to be thankful for their lives...

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:01.980
And give them the feeling of "I did it!"

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:03.480
So for today...

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.620
With this feelings in mind, I’ll decide today's activity!

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:09.240
May this world find peace!

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:10.760
Jaka, jaka, jaka, jaka...

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:11.260
Jan!

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:13.640
"Dance Cover”...

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:16.080
