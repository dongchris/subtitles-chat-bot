00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:15.100
The morning is when she lingers.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.300
It's before the world wants
anything from her.

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.500
And... that's when she's most beautiful.

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:30.500
It's true, not many saw her like that.

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:33.600
But I can't say I was the only one.

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.600
Even though we each had
our own beginnings,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
mornings like this
was shared between us all.

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.750
[glasses]
She used to tell people that it was like,

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:14.850
the world was drawn
with a dull piece of charcoal.

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.000
That was before me.

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.500
Now that she sees things my way,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
everything makes a little more sense.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.200
This is me.

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.000
If I'm in for anything,

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.312
it's to show her the world.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.500
Is that so bad?

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.400
A quiet morning like the many before it,

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.300
calm, comfortable.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.792
But comfort can be terribly blinding.

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.151
The difference with
this&nbsp;particular morning...

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.350
is in a call.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.200
[phone ring]

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:21.900
She smiles.

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:24.900
For who?

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:30.050
I can't see anymore...

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.400
[telephone]
She tells me she wants to be a raindrop.

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.000
She doesn't mind falling,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.500
as long as she's not alone.

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.800
And raindrops, are never alone.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
She always has a new story to tell me.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.900
Today,

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.000
it's about being a raindrop.

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:57.850
I wish I could have been there.

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.400
Because stories aren't always enough,

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.750
and words can only go so far.

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:06.700
This is me.

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.150
Sometimes I wonder
if she's still talking to me,

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:12.600
or if I'm just... eavesdropping.

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:14.750
It used to be every day,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.200
sometimes for hours,
sometimes for minutes.

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.980
Healthy relationships are based
on communication.

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:24.800
But her words,

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:27.600
however sweet and real,

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:29.640
sound so distant.

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.700
Now, they flow past me effortlessly.

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:35.560
As if...

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:39.370
they were meant for someone else.

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.016
[umbrella]
She must know what she does to me.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.300
Her every touch.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.200
Every time she holds my hand.

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:51.300
Every time she holds me close.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.200
This is me.

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.830
If you hold my hand,
I'll be yours forever.

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:06.200
A simple promise.

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:08.000
That's all I can offer.

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:09.810
Is ﻿it﻿, enough?

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:13.120
It may be too late for me.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.250
It may be too late...

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:27.725
[scarf]&nbsp;Anyone can look from a distance.

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.200
A stranger can look from a distance,

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:33.000
what's so special about that?

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:36.700
But to know her scent...

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:39.450
mean something else.

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:43.120
It means, we've been close.

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:48.500
Closer than anyone else.

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:51.300
I daresay I'm lucky.

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:56.000
But when she doesn't want me,

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:57.900
when she's away,

00:06:00.152 --> 00:06:01.250
and it's just...

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:04.580
her scent...&nbsp;with me.

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:10.170
I can only feel...&nbsp;forgotten.

00:06:13.832 --> 00:06:15.200
This is me.

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:17.400
Left behind.

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:20.598
Am I the stranger now?

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.200
[cup]&nbsp;There are those nights,
when it's just the two of us,

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:33.600
when she softly hides in her own thoughts,

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:38.000
when only one thing seems
to melt the cold silence,

00:06:38.835 --> 00:06:39.835
a kiss.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.100
This is me.

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:53.350
Ask me what the perfect day taste like,

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:54.750
and they'll say...

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:56.600
her lips.

00:06:57.650 --> 00:06:59.200
She was my first kiss.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.400
That has to mean something,

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:04.500
something sure and true.

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:07.852
Because the taste&nbsp;of a pure kiss
can't be shared.

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:11.400
It's the dreadfully romantic idea,

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:13.700
that there can be only one.

00:07:16.186 --> 00:07:17.200
The question is...

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.800
am I, her only one?

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:23.300
I'm afraid the truth will break me,

00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:26.000
but her kiss is convincing.

00:07:29.275 --> 00:07:30.775
I'm not her only one.

00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:41.000
She said she wanted to be a raindrop.

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:43.200
And today,

00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:45.500
it finally broke us.

00:08:51.290 --> 00:08:53.000
She had found her own to fall with,

00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:55.500
her own to fall for.

00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:02.880
Today...

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.600
she was a raindrop.
