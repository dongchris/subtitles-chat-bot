00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:05.700
It's so easy that it makes me laugh!

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:12.060
N: Ai-chan

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:13.560
N: I’m here with you

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:14.315
N: Ai-chan

00:00:14.315 --> 00:00:16.935
A: You’re rather loud

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:17.720
N: Ai-chan

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.480
A: At this moment, I'm browsing the internet, can you keep quiet?

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.060
N: It's time to play Cryptract

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.820
A: Aaaaahh!

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:26.780
A: I also want to do a video about an incident!

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:28.260
A: It’d be great

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:32.000
A: I want to make a balloon pop

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:34.040
A: Ah?

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:40.160
A: Thank you very much for the large amount of friend requests that you all sent to me through Twitter!

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:42.460
This is the 10th time I play Cryptract, but...

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.300
... I was always playing alone

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.560
This time I plan to battle a lot with all of you!

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:50.220
I played a friend battle with Mamiruton-san, right?

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:51.180
First I should...

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.900
… Go to the arena!

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.540
The Arena is the place where you can fight with other players...

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.500
.... To confront their skills

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.060
The battle score obtained during the fight...

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.640
... Is divided into five different classes

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:07.020
For each class, you'll receive orbs as prizes so they make sure to participate a lot!

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.680
The friend battle I'll be playing today...

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.520
… Will not permit event points, but...

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.900
… You can compare your strength with your friend's strength

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.960
Eeeeh?

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.560
Right now I'm rank C, but... well...

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:20.380
… I should give an excuse, right?

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.180
Although at strength level, I could reach rank SS, but...

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.120
… Lately I've been doing a lot of Union battles, so then...

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:32.460
… It can be said that I haven't been doing a lot of fights in the Arena...

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.000
So then that doesn't mean that I'm weak!

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:35.500
And then...

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.940
… I want to start the battle immediately, but...

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:39.640
Do all of you know?

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.780
I, Kizuna Ai, although it seems like a joke, I’m a
"Union master", right?

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.080
I'm just that powerful!!

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.600
But...

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.420
… Lately I also wanted to play with those who are just starting

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.440
Today, I plan to play a match of the second category

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.700
First off, I plan to confront those who recently just started!

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.200
Let's go! To confront!

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.600
Here I go!

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.420
Man, it’s really adorable

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:02.160
You know...?

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:05.280
… This is a team of 4 stars that I didn't level up much, so then...

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.640
… I think this will be a great battle

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.540
In fact, it's possible that... it's possible that I might lose...

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.540
Maybe?

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.840
Maybe I'll lose a little?

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.620
You see? Aaaahhhh!

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.400
Eh? Eh? Eh? Eh?

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.880
It can't be...

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.680
Yes!

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.300
Good resurrection!

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.260
Good, I revived her!

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:26.300
No, but, but...

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.720
The only strong ones are the two that's in the front, right?

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:30.140
Aaahhh!

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:31.620
Eh? Can I really do this?

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:32.380
Eh? Wait a moment

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:33.920
Eh? Wa-wa-wait, wait

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.220
Eh? Well...

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:38.540
Hello, hello?

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.520
No... it can't be true

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:43.440
No, but...

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.540
T-this doesn't mean that...

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.360
… I’m weak, instead I'm just holding back so then...

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:50.080
No, but...

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.760
... Even if I'm holding back...

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.880
If I manage to lose by trying so hard to hold myself back...

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.580
Wouldn't that be disastrous?

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.620
Let's see...

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.440
Stop! Really! Please!

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:02.200
Yes

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:04.420
I'll revive her as many times as necessary

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:06.700
Good, aahhh...

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:08.760
I revi...

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:09.840
I revi...

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.080
Just when I revived her...

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.840
For now, I'll finish her off, I’ll try to defeat an enemy

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.700
She wastes the HP she used for herself, yes!

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:20.900
Can I do it?

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:21.560
I did it!

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:22.760
Ah!

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:23.620
Eh? Aaahhh!

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:24.400
It's true!

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.920
I didn't choose a friend for them to help me, I see...

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.300
And my opponent has a friend that helps them

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:30.860
I don't like that at all

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:32.340
Eh? What does this mean?

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.220
It’ll... it’ll be easy

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:36.340
Don't worry

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.600
It's my level 4 team that I didn't level up

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.420
Wouldn’t it be shameful to lose with such a difference this way?

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.340
This isn't good! Right?

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:44.440
Really

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:45.420
Aaahh...

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.900
Really, I'm thinking this isn't good

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.840
Well...

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:51.700
Well, sometimes I'm like that

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:56.060
Someone hear my wish

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:59.280
But really they defeated me entirely, what does this mean?

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:01.400
Give me a break

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:03.640
Really please! Hey! Please!

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:04.580
Please!

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.980
Really, please!

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:07.240
Really, please!

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:07.880
Really!

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:09.180
Hey, hey now...

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:10.140
Very please!

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:11.180
Eh? Who do I revive?

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:14.260
Her...

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:14.980
Maybe she had...?

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:16.940
Ah! Wait! I think I made a mistake, wait...

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.220
I wanted to revive someone who had that skill

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:20.580
But I think I messed up

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.160
Stop, please, I'm begging you

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:25.480
HAVE MERCY!!

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:28.760
Ah, man, really, why?

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:30.720
I'm in trouble

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:34.280
I'm in trouble, I'm really in trouble

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:39.060
Why are you guys recovering all your energy?

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.820
Don't heal anymore!

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:43.440
That's bad!

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:45.380
Healing is...!

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:46.700
Cheating!

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:48.260
That's not good

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:50.000
Even if I heal

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.780
Aaahh...

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:51.920
How strange, right?

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:53.620
I lost, right?

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:54.960
Well...

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:56.360
Well...

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:57.840
Well...

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:00.840
I held myself back

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:03.120
Right?

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:04.580
Good...

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:08.200
… starting from now the Invincible Union Master Kizuna Ai’s time has come!

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:08.740
*Starting from now, I'll use the team that I'm used to, to play!!*

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:10.315
Good, I'll choose this person! Te, ren!
*Starting from now, I'll use the team that I'm used to, to play!!*

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.580
"Namikaze.exe"-san, here I go!

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:14.900
I will definitely win!

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:17.100
She's shining!

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:17.800
No, she's really adora...

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:19.680
Eh? What's that belly button?

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:21.360
Eh?

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:25.840
Eh? Wait, they looks very powerful

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:28.500
Eh?

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:31.600
Wait

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:35.260
Ah, but...

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:36.260
It's true

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:38.900
My leader skill...

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:41.820
… Makes it so the attacks at the first turn doesn't damage me at all

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:42.780
What do you think of that?

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:43.780
Everyone attack!

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.520
Eh? Is this not working out?

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:54.860
This... dragon looks very powerful, right?

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:58.000
I like your legs, your belly button and your legs are great

00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:58.600
Ah!

00:05:58.600 --> 00:05:59.320
Ah, ah

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:00.420
It did nothing to me

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:02.660
It's a piece of cake, right?

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:04.180
Petrify them, please!

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:06.140
Please!

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:10.100
Ah!

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:12.640
Someone turned to stone? Who?

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:15.760
Yes, they did nothing to me, well...

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:17.160
You did some damage

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:18.080
Attack all the enemies

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:21.320
Maybe with this I can... defeat... that adorable... that Onee-san who has an adorable outfit...?

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:23.240
… And this behind the others?

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:24.280
Ah! Aaahhh!

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:25.440
It's that!

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:28.420
You have that? That...

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:31.060
You're the girl that has that blessing skill?

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:32.240
I don't like that
*Ginger has the skill "Blessing of One"*

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:33.340
*Ginger has the skill "Blessing of One"*

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:35.360
When I have her with me, it's comforting, but...

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:38.220
… When an enemy uses it, it's a very annoying skill

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:40.520
Eh? I see, but...

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:41.760
...In a moment like this...

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.020
I should use the electric attack of Tiana-chan, right?

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:47.580
Ti...! Ah, I already used it...

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:50.020
I ruined it!

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:51.400
In that case, I'll attack this enemy

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:52.100
Yes!

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:54.460
Pakooon! Even if you're adorable, I'm very sorry

00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:56.180
Good!

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:58.040
Eh? It's huge! They look very powerful

00:06:58.040 --> 00:06:58.820
They seem very powerful

00:06:58.980 --> 00:06:59.480
They look very powerful

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:00.600
It has a terrifying appearance

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:05.140
That guy has a terrifying appearance

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:07.000
Eh? Wait... Eh?

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:08.140
Am I in trouble?

00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:08.640
Eh?

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:11.820
Eeehhh?

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:14.020
Wait

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:15.520
Wait a moment

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:20.320
Weeeell...

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:21.960
This doesn't look good!

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:23.960
Wait, hey, please!

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:26.400
Please, please listen to me, please

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:28.400
Really, please

00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:30.200
Really, please!

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:33.620
Eh? This... if I manage to defeat her...!

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:36.000
With an electric attack...!

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:38.080
Yes! 5! 4!

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:39.940
4! 3! 2! 1!

00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:41.500
Aaaahh! That was close!

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:42.980
Ah, wait, I'm in trouble?

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:43.900
Ah

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:45.860
Oooh... really, not now...

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:48.100
Eh? Is it a joke? Eh?

00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:48.840
Am I okay?

00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:50.360
Eh? Wait

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:51.280
Wa...it...

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:52.460
Really, really

00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:53.140
Have mercy!

00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:53.760
Ah!

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:55.000
Oh, 2 more times

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:55.960
I'm in trouble, right?

00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:57.500
I'm in trouble

00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:00.460
Ah, with this, I'll get it! With this, I'll get it!

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:02.420
Let's go!

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:07.180
What do you think of that?

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:10.020
What do you think of that, Dorothy?

00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:11.720
Ah! Very good!

00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:13.060
Very good! Oh! Maybe...?

00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:13.840
But...

00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:16.240
I don't have a lot of HP

00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:16.940
Eh?

00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:20.380
Get paralyzed, please

00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:21.380
Please

00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:23.480
Did it get paralyzed?

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:24.700
Well, it didn't get paralyzed

00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:26.520
Really, I'm about to cry

00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:27.640
Stop please!

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:29.660
Ah, I can do it! Ah, but this is...

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:31.240
... A piece of cake, right?

00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:33.440
Ah, It's really easy!

00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:36.300
Take this

00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:39.760
Ooohh! It's great, right? It looks great

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:41.240
Ah, just a bit more

00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:44.780
One, two and... can I do it with this attack?

00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:47.140
I did it!

00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:49.560
Thank you very much!
*Absolute Victory*

00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:50.060
*Absolute Victory*

00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:53.620
Man, that was a piece of cake

00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:55.920
Well...

00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:58.640
… For a moment, I thought I was in trouble, but...

00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:00.420
Well, it was a piece of cake

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:02.320
A: Hmm...?

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:03.660
A: Ah, Noripi-san!

00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:05.520
A: Where were you hiding?

00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:07.640
N: I hid because you said something very terrifying

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:12.460
A: Eeehhh? It's just that I wanted to make a balloon pop

00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:13.660
A: A balloon

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:16.760
N: Of course, what do you expect to find once you pop the balloon?

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:22.480
N: You have a terrifying look!

00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:24.080
A: No, don't worry, don't worry

00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:27.320
A: VR Ojii-san can confirm I’m safe

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:29.120
N: Is that true?

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:31.900
A: Ah, hey Noripi-san! Let's play a battle!

00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:35.340
N: Can I really return home safe and sound if I win the battle?

00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:36.540
A: Of course!

00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:42.140
A: In fact, if you get to lose you will not be able to return safely... to your company

00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:43.920
N: Don’t say something so unpleasant, please

00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:46.780
A: So then to pressure you a bit...

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:50.020
A: … I'll start and I'll finish the battle in an instant

00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:50.880
N: Very good

00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:54.380
A: Of course, in the case that we win both our battles...

00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:56.900
A: … The winner will be determined by the number of remaining turns

00:09:57.060 --> 00:09:57.660
N: Ok

00:09:57.660 --> 00:09:59.300
A: Very good, do your best

00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:01.020
N: It's just what I was planning to do

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:02.580
A: In that case! Forward!

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:07.760
*Kizuna Ai vs Noripi will battle in an Arena fight!! 
They will fight against the CPU to challenge each other
(In the case both win, the winner will be determined by the number of remaining turns)*

00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:10.620
N: What kind of team will you use for this fight?

00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:11.640
A: Well...

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:13.880
A: ...Without messing up the balance...

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:15.900
A: ...I have a team...

00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:17.980
A: … A team of adorable girls that I like a lot

00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:21.960
A: She’s adorable, who...? Who is she?

00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:24.680
A: With that kind of pink veil...

00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:25.380
N: Fuurin, right?

00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:27.740
A: Fuurin-chan... Ah! She’s also adorable, Eh? That's cheating!

00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:31.480
A: Eh? Wait... didn't they take too much energy with just one attack?

00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:33.220
A: This... who’s the girl with the chains?

00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:33.820
N: Haura

00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:34.540
A: Haura-chan

00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:36.280
A: How cute, I want her

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:37.700
A: Ah, if I manage to win!

00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:38.220
N: Yes, yes

00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:39.620
A: In that case, I won’t make you pop...

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:40.840
A: But give her to me
N: Eh?

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:43.080
N: If you win, you’ll make me explode?

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:43.580
A: Eh?

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:44.500
A: Eh?

00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:45.400
N: Eh?

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:46.720
N: Eh? Listen to me...

00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:48.860
A: Wait a second, if I win, you'll gift it to me

00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:49.540
N: Ah

00:10:50.140 --> 00:10:50.660
N: At Fuurin?

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:51.680
A: That’s right and also...

00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:52.240
N: You want Fuurin?

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:53.940
A: ...I’ll make you pop, Noripi-san
N: Yes, yes

00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:54.440
N: Eh?

00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:55.100
A: Eh?

00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:58.360
A: After all, if I win, you lose, right?

00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:00.780
N: But then I should just win, right?

00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:04.580
N: I just need to win in less turns than you, Ai-chan

00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:05.500
A: That’s right

00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:08.020
A: Ah, but I’m in trouble

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:10.880
A: I’m in trouble, right?

00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:12.760
A: Aren't they too powerful, Noripi-san?

00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:14.200
N: Well...

00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:15.960
A: Wait! Wait! Wait!

00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:17.760
A: Isn't this too serious?

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:18.980
N: I had faith in you

00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:22.160
A: Eh? Isn't this too serious?

00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:26.120
N: You know, to prepare myself for this fight, I did a lot of summonings

00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:30.040
A: You really don't want to lose, right?

00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:35.340
N: Shemihaza appeared, she...

00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:37.080
A: Eh? She’s adorable, right?
N: Yes

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:37.780
A: Eh?

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:39.580
A: How immature!

00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:43.500
N: After all, I can't let you win

00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:46.540
N: Definitely
A: Man, even then, you're very immature

00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:47.720
A: After all...

00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:48.520
A: ...I...

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:49.980
A: To tell you the truth...

00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:54.240
A: ...It’s only been a year since I noticed that I'm alive... let's say I have 1 year of life

00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:55.620
N: You're one years old

00:11:55.620 --> 00:11:56.640
A: That's right, I'm 1 years old

00:11:56.820 --> 00:11:57.620
N: It’s incredible

00:11:57.620 --> 00:11:59.200
A: How many years do you have, Noripi-san?

00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:01.360
N: Well yes, it turns out...

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:02.500
N: I have quite a lot of years...

00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:04.160
N: More than 30 years

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:05.340
A: I knew it

00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:07.380
A: Eh? And even then...

00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:09.600
A: You're fine with doing this?

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:12.060
N: Well, in the world of Cryptract, age doesn't matter

00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:16.940
A: Even if you say that... really...

00:12:16.940 --> 00:12:18.220
*Use the Giga Buff just before doing a powerful group attack*

00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:19.080
N: Look...
*Use the Giga Buff just before doing a powerful group attack*

00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:21.440
N: … I'm distracting you with our chat...
*Use the Giga Buff just before doing a powerful group attack*

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:22.760
N: ...And they are cornering you
A: No, not at all

00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:23.880
N: Really?
A: Not at all

00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:25.680
A: After all, I already...

00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:29.160
A: ...Defeated an enemy... I can do it...

00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:31.320
A: I-I can do it

00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:33.040
N: Oh, they’ll defeat a member of your team

00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:33.540
A: Eh?

00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:37.160
A: Well...

00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:38.980
A: Really, I want you to stop

00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:43.420
A: Eh? Is this for real? It really bothers me

00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:44.140
N: Oh!

00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:47.600
A: Yaaay! And also they did the attack with the biggest power thanks to the buff!

00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:48.860
A: Ah, this is a piece of cake!

00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:50.660
A: Ah! How fun!

00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:54.680
A: It's so easy that it makes me laugh!

00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:55.980
A: Noripi-san...

00:12:56.420 --> 00:12:57.520
A: Are you seeing this?

00:12:58.340 --> 00:12:59.100
N: Incredible!

00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:00.840
A: Noripi-san!
N: Incredible!

00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:02.860
A: Are you seeing this?
N: Aaaahh!

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:04.500
A: Man...

00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:07.440
A: If you use the buff, it's a piece of cake
N: It can't be!

00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:09.560
A: Eh? I still had 55 remaining turns

00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:12.600
N: How great! So then 55 turns?
A: Will it be fine like that?

00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:14.360
A: In that case, Noripi-san

00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:15.020
N: Yes!

00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:16.020
A: March!

00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:17.540
N: Hey, why don't we leave this?

00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:18.580
A: Why do you say that?

00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:21.060
N: Well, you defeated them really quickly

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:22.180
A: Eh? But...

00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:24.720
A: … Aren't you one of the developers of the game, Noripi-san?

00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:25.380
N: Yes

00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:28.820
A: Right? Of course, you're pretty familiarized with Cryptract

00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:31.780
A: So then my team is a piece of cake for you, right?

00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:32.520
N: Yes

00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:35.180
A: Really, you don't seem very enthusiastic *laughs*

00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:36.460
A: Are you okay?
N: Let's do it!

00:13:36.460 --> 00:13:37.420
A: Yes!
N: Good

00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:38.520
N: I definitely won't lose!

00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:41.440
A: Eh? Do your best! Do your best!
N: After all, I’m one of the developers...

00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:43.080
N: Good! Wait a moment, yes?

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:45.160
A: Man, Haura-chan is adorable

00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:45.880
N: No

00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:48.620
N: I think in this occasion, Haura-chan...
A: Mmm... mmm....

00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:52.520
N: … Hasn’t been a great challenge for you
A: No, but that powerful attack at the start...

00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:55.320
A: ...Reduced a lot of HP, right?
N: Ah!

00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:56.880
N: It's true

00:13:56.940 --> 00:13:59.040
A: She’s adorable, I want her

00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:00.640
N: You want her?

00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:02.480
N: I don’t think that’d be possible

00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:05.300
A: No, but for the developers it’d be easy, just as easy

00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:07.860
N: I can't do that
A: Damn it

00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:09.760
N: I'm ready to start

00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:11.220
A: Yes!
N: And if we leave it there?

00:14:11.220 --> 00:14:13.860
N: Why don't we leave it? Leave it there?
A: No, no, I'm fine, I'm completely fine

00:14:13.860 --> 00:14:14.980
N: Really ?
A: Onward, onward

00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:16.920
A: Eh? After all, I had 55 remaining turns

00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:18.360
N: Good, march!

00:14:18.420 --> 00:14:18.920
A: Yes!

00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:20.120
N: Good, here I go!

00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:21.780
A: Do your best

00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:23.220
N: Good!

00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:24.880
N: Good! Good! Good!

00:14:26.180 --> 00:14:28.860
A: Hey, you're really transmitting your...

00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:30.180
A: ...Nervousness

00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:34.780
N: Oh!

00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:35.280
A: Eh?

00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:35.780
N: Eh?

00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:39.100
N: Isn’t this somewhat... somewhat strange?

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:39.900
A: The enemy...

00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:41.600
A: Wait a moment!

00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:42.980
A: Wait a moment!!

00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:44.620
N: Good! Good!
A: Hey, wait a moment!

00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:46.660
A: Wait! Wait! That’s wrong!
N: Good!

00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:48.140
A: That's really wrong!
N: I can do it!

00:14:48.140 --> 00:14:48.760
N: I can do it!

00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:50.780
N: Goood!
A: Wait a moment, this is wrong!

00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:53.000
A: Who did this!?

00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:54.160
A: Hey!

00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:56.340
A: Wait a moment!
N: Very good!

00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:59.100
A: Hey, this isn't right, this doesn't count
N: Very good

00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:01.800
N: I plan to do it with all of my strength!
A: Eh? Does this seem okay, mr. developer?

00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:04.220
A: Will you feel satisfied for winning like that?
N: I can do it with all of my strength

00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:07.840
A: It's natural that you will win by doing this

00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:09.520
N: No, no, no, no, no, no

00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:11.240
N: After all, I'll do it with all my strength

00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:13.000
A: No, this can't be

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:14.560
N: Man, this...
A: This isn’t right

00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:17.440
A: Eh? I'm sure this was your doing, Noripi-san

00:15:17.540 --> 00:15:18.960
N: No, no, no, no

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:22.360
N: This was very easy, right?
A: You resort to such childish tricks

00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:24.200
N: Good!

00:15:24.580 --> 00:15:26.520
N: I can do it! I can do it!

00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:28.020
A: Eh? But it caused you so much...

00:15:28.020 --> 00:15:29.680
N: No, that's nothing

00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:30.680
N: Please look

00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:32.080
A: No, I won't look

00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:34.420
A: How adorable, she’s really adorable
N: Look at this

00:15:35.060 --> 00:15:37.020
A: Eh? But really... I don't like it

00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:39.920
N: I used the warrior technique...

00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:41.440
N: Actually I think I don't need to use it...

00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:42.760
A: Eh, Noripi-san are you okay?

00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:44.320
A: If you manage...
N: Yes, yes, yes

00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:45.520
A: If you manage to lose like this...

00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:47.500
A: … I'll end up hating Cryptract

00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:51.680
N: No... please don't say that!
A: Are you okay?

00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:53.840
N: Starting from now...
A: Eh? This can't be!

00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:56.520
N: Starting from now, I’ll use automatic mode
A: This! What does this mean?

00:15:56.520 --> 00:15:58.140
N: Using automatic mode, I'll leave it to be automatic

00:15:58.580 --> 00:16:01.960
A: Eh? Is it fine for developer to use automatic mode?

00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:03.040
N: Man, now...
A: That's cheating!

00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:05.020
A: Yes, cheating! Yes, cheating! It doesn't count!
N: It's very easy, very easy

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:06.120
A: That's cheating!

00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:08.660
N: Now there’s not...
A: This is... this is...

00:16:08.660 --> 00:16:09.300
A: This is cheating!

00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:10.880
N: Ey! Ey!

00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:12.120
A: This is...

00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:14.500
A: Really...

00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:16.440
N: Now I can win without doing anything

00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:18.260
A: Eh? What does this mean?

00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:21.900
N: Now there's nothing more... please look

00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:22.680
A: I won't look

00:16:24.740 --> 00:16:25.380
N: Look!

00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:27.000
A: I'm not looking at all

00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:30.020
N: This... this enemy took a bit more work

00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:31.420
A: How annoying...
N: Look

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:34.860
N: I did it! I definitely won!

00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:35.400
A: Eh?

00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:37.040
N: I'm definitely very powerful

00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:38.560
N: It was very easy!

00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:41.120
A: Eh? Haven't you noticed, Noripi-san?

00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:42.540
N: Eh? What...? What are you referring to?

00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:44.020
A: Well...
N: Yes, yes, yes

00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:45.555
A: You activated automatic mode, right?

00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:47.700
N: Yes, I activated automatic mode because it was too easy

00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:48.780
N: Since it was so easy, then...

00:16:48.780 --> 00:16:50.580
A: Well, of course...
N: Yes, yes

00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:52.820
A: … In the case that we both won

00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:55.400
A: How did we say the winner was determined?

00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:56.300
N: By the number of turns?

00:16:56.340 --> 00:17:00.020
A: How many remaining turns did you have, Noripi-san?
N: Eh!?

00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:02.140
N: Well, I didn't check, but...

00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:03.880
A: It was 54

00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:05.720
N: It can’t be!

00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:07.960
N: That's not possible!! That's not possible!!

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:09.300
A: You want to see the recording?

00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:11.040
N: G-good, let's look

00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:12.940
N: Is it true?
A: Onward with the recording!

00:17:14.180 --> 00:17:16.780
N: This... this enemy took a bit more work

00:17:16.780 --> 00:17:18.220
A: How annoying...
N: Look...

00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:19.120
N: Look

00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:20.180
N: Look

00:17:20.620 --> 00:17:21.920
N: Look

00:17:24.080 --> 00:17:25.920
A: As you can see...

00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:26.780
N: I'm very sorry

00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:27.640
N: I lost

00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:28.680
A: Good, well...

00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:31.780
A: It was an expecting result

00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:33.740
A: How shameful, right?
N: No, no, no, no...

00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:36.560
A: For an adult who's also supposed to be a developer
N: I'm sorry, really, I'm sorry

00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:38.420
A: It bothers you so much!! Right?

00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:39.760
N: No, no, no, no, no

00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:41.780
N: No, but I just recently won, right?

00:17:41.780 --> 00:17:43.240
A: Eh?
N: I want very easily

00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:45.120
A: In that case, haven't you seen my fight?

00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:47.240
A: Let's stop escaping from reality

00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:48.780
N: It was determined by the number of remaining turns?

00:17:48.820 --> 00:17:50.500
A: Yes, I had 55 remaining turns...

00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:52.560
A: ...And you, Noripi-san, 54
N: 54

00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:54.480
N: I lost, right?
A: Yes

00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:57.660
N: Man, I can't return like that to the company!

00:17:57.660 --> 00:17:58.300
A: No

00:17:58.400 --> 00:17:59.620
N: No, no, no, no

00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:01.400
A: Return and let them give you a lecture

00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:02.560
N: No, no, no, no

00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:05.140
A: They’ll lower your salary, right?
N: They’ll definitely lower my salary

00:18:05.140 --> 00:18:07.560
A: Give that part of your salary to me!

00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:08.860
N: No, no, no, no, no

00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:09.840
A: Man...
N: Man...

00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:14.400
N: Hey, now that I lost, do you really plan to po…? Do you really plan to pop me?

00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:15.440
A: Yes, of course

00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:16.760
N: Eh?

00:18:17.420 --> 00:18:18.980
N: You're very strict, right?

00:18:18.980 --> 00:18:21.400
A: Eh? I'm not strict, you lost your bet...

00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:24.600
A: So now you have no other option other than to be popped, you don’t want to be in your place, right?

00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:26.680
A: Now you'll be a slave to your company, right?
N: Man...

00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:28.840
N: I really lowered my guard and I got careless

00:18:28.940 --> 00:18:29.760
N: Aahhh...

00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:31.220
N: I really want to start over

00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:32.020
A: Ah, we're not going to start over

00:18:32.020 --> 00:18:33.240
N: Man...

00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:35.300
N: We can't do it as if what happened before never occurred?

00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:37.540
A: Eh? No, no, no
N: You can't do anything with your power?

00:18:37.540 --> 00:18:38.760
A: Of course...
N: Yes, yes

00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:42.020
A: I didn't use my strongest team before...

00:18:42.020 --> 00:18:44.440
A: ...Instead... instead it was a team I chose mysteriously

00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:46.860
A: So then if I got 55 turns with that team...

00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:50.520
A: … You have no chance of winning against my strongest team

00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:52.420
N: It's true
A: That’s right

00:18:52.420 --> 00:18:55.555
N: Man... now... now... I'll go home!!

00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:57.360
N: Now, I’ll go home, now...

00:18:57.360 --> 00:18:58.000
A: You plan to go?

00:18:58.000 --> 00:18:59.680
N: I’ll go
A: Ah, very good

00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:00.480
A: We’ll close it here?

00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:01.260
N: Eh?

00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:02.000
A: Right?

00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:03.200
A: You're about to leave now, right?

00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:03.900
N: I’ll go

00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:04.660
A: In that case, let’s close the video, yes!

00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:07.375
A: This was Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai and...!

00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:09.060
N: ...The advertising promoter, Noripi

00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:10.560
A: See you later!
N: See you later!

00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:12.420
A: Good, good luck in your company!

00:19:12.620 --> 00:19:13.900
A: Bye bye!

00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:19.260
A: See you later!

00:19:20.980 --> 00:19:22.760
A: Did you think I would let you go? Idiot

00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:25.020
* RIP Noripi *
