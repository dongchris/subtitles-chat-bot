00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.040
I wish I could say tons of different words...

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:10.820
Like, English, Chinese, Korean..

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:12.780
And tons of other languages...

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.640
But, as a start...

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.260
I'll go for the most used language by everyone..

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:17.760
English!

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.580
So that's precisely why today, we're going to learn English!

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:24.340
I think those easy to understand sentences are easy to remember as well, so then..

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.900
Let's learn using those easy to understand sentences!

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:29.060
English quiz!

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:30.440
Then, let's start with the first question

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:31.300
Te, ren!

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.120
Eh? What? Intelligence?

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:46.260
Ai-chan is a star, she's very adorable, artistic, and intelligent..

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:47.700
Good, that's perfect

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:48.340
The answer!

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:48.840
Te, ren!

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:53.600
Eh? I knew that, so why?

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:54.420
Then, next!

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:05.820
Giving you money!

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.880
Answer: He's giving you money in the ocean

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:09.520
Correct answer!

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:10.060
Te, ren!

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.700
No, no, no! Let's use it for ourselves!

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.360
Or, it's fine if you send it to me, I don't mind~

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:19.060
Te, ren!

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.200
Ah! this looks easy~

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.340
Answer: I am...

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.040
Going to the King of pirates!

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.240
I am going to be the king of pirates!

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:35.820
How am I supposed to know that!?

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.420
What? ''Pirates'' means pirate?

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.940
''King of... kin.. king of pirates'' means king of pirates!?

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:43.960
Something like that?

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.860
''Believe'' is something like to trust, right?

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:55.620
Believe in you...

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.060
Maybe it means that it depends on yourself?

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:01.460
Answer: Believe it or not, it's your own choice

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:02.980
I think it's something like that... What do you think?

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:03.480
Correct Answer!

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.880
This is totally wrong, isn't it!?

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:06.620
What does it mean?

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:07.920
Huh? Isn't ''Kami'' god?

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:08.460
Mmm?

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.000
I am going to be the god of the new world!
(Written in Japanese)

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.480
Eh? Somehow, this looks like something from an anime...

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:17.360
Ah!

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.340
I think I've understood it...

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.160
Answer: There's only one truth!

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.820
Something like that?

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:23.120
Perfect!

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.640
It's to be expected from a super A.I!

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:26.820
These glasses are the same as Conan too~

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:32.500
I'm running away...

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:33.380
''Not'' means...

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.080
I mustn't run away!

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.660
Answer: I mustn't run away, I mustn't run away, I mustn't run away

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:40.420
Oh!

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.140
I wasn't so off!

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.780
Correct answer!

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.120
I mustn't run away, I mustn't run away, I mustn't run away Shinji-kun!

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.880
Right?

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:55.240
People...

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:56.060
Ah, I see!

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.040
Girl und Panzer is good~!

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.600
Right?

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:59.400
Wrong...

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.600
I was completely off...

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.780
Look! The people are like garbage!

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:04.640
Is the correct answer...

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.380
Why is it ''like''?

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:07.100
Why?

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:08.600
Why is it ''like''?

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:09.480
I must get the next one...

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:16.380
Answer: You are already dead

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.300
What do you think? This seems correct...

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:19.440
Aaah!

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.340
Am I a genius!?

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:22.640
I'm definitely a genius~

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:23.620
The correct answer is..

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:24.600
You are already dead

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:25.100
Yaay!

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.600
Maan, learning English is...

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:29.360
Really... you know...

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:30.760
Difficult, right?

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.520
I think it's impossible for me to learn English..

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:35.020
Eh?

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:36.460
Last question!

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:38.020
Eh? That's enough!

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:39.340
I don't understand anything!

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:40.340
This is hard!

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:40.960
Impossible!

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:51.200
To give up...

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:52.280
"You give up.."

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.340
'Give up'' means give up...

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.660
Give up, "Game"..."Game over"...

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:57.420
Ah!

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:58.480
I understand!

00:03:58.480 --> 00:03:59.680
I see, I see it!

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:00.220
Yes!

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:03.760
Answer: If you give up, the match ends there!

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:04.460
Correct?

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:05.380
I got it!

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:06.580
Ah, I think this is enough~

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:08.700
So everyone, what do you think about this?

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:12.460
English is a piece of cake for an intelligent super A.I!

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:13.860
So in that case, I'll see you next time

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:15.480
Bye bye~!

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.360
There's more at the end!
