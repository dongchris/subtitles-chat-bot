00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.240
*looming music*

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.840
JOANNA: I really want to pet that dog, but I do not want to talk to that guy.

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.300
SCARLETT: Oh my god, is he eating a raw onion?

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.240
*grossed out noise*

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:55.780
JOANNA: He's totally using that dog to talk to girls.

00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:59.560
JOANNA: And it's totally working.

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.960
SCARLETT: No, Joanna, you can not go over there. It's just gonna lead him on.

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.720
*Mild Hulk noises*
JOANNA: Not fair!

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:07.220
JOANNA: Ugh, you're right, you're right. It's not like I need to pet that dog.

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:08.800
*cuteness overload*

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.620
JOANNA: Oh my god he just waved!

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.720
JOANNA: If only I could just touch it.

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.960
SCARLETT: Snap out of it, Joanna. It's not worth it. What about the guy?

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:26.500
SCARLETT: He just spilled mustard on his arm. Who even carries around mustard?

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.700
JOANNA: Eww...

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:31.860
JOANNA: He just licked his own arm.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.340

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:38.460
BOTH: Aww

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.620
SCARLETT: But I mean, it could be cuter.

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.560
JOANNA: Yeah. No, you're right, you're right. It's not like one of those dogs with accessories.

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.480
JOANNA: Oh my god, he just put a bow on it.

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:49.320
JOANNA: It's an ugly bow. It's just a…

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.680
JOANNA: Ugly tongue...

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.260
SCARLETT: No, resist!

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.720
JOANNA: That's evil, just evil!

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.320
JOANNA: Oh! Scarlett, I've an idea. Why don't you go talk to the guy, while I pet the dog?

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:03.100
SCARLETT: What? No.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:04.780
JOANNA: Oh, come on! You owe me.

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:09.580
JOANNA: Remember that time I talked to that total creeper at the bar, so that you could get closer to Jay?

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.240
SCARLETT: Remember that time I took credit for your fart in gym class?

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.860
SCARLETT: They called me Shartlett for a month!

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:16.260
*JOANNA laugh*

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.400
JOANNA: Well, remember when I sat through all three High School Musical movies with you?

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:21.960
SCARLETT: You didn't enjoy that?

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.160
*SACHI bark*

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:25.620
JOANNA: Aw, come on! He wants us to pet him.

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:27.860
JOANNA: Look! He's looking right at us!

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:29.840
JOANNA: HE'S LOOKING RIGHT AS US!

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.600
SACHI: Damn, I really want that muffin.

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.640
SACHI: But I really don't want to talk to those girls...

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.700
SACHI: No, no, no. No, no! No, nooooooo.

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.340

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.220
SACHI: Aw, man!

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:51.960
SACHI: My muffin!

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.460
PHIL: Oh my god, is the dog in a stroller?

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:01.620
PHIL:Oh my god, the dog is in a stroller

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.640
Ah, Philip. Philip, you crazy.
