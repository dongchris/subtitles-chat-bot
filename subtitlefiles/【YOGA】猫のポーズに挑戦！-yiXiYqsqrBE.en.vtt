Hello there!
Kizuna Ai here!

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:08.460
Stiff shoulder, headache, stomachache,  eye strain, lack of sleep, tired body, stress,

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:09.160
etc! etc!

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.240
Modern people nowadays have these kind of problems, right?

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:16.140
I'm virtual so I don't have those problems, though!

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.740
So for all of you human viewers watching Ai Channel!

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:24.660
Ai-chan wants you to always have good health, so..

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:26.360
From today we will have..

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.040
"Beauty and Persona"

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.140
..as a series on this channel!

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:31.760
Y O G A !

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:33.300
When we say yoga,

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.700
don't you normally think of girls?

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.140
beautification or diet, for example!

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.220
There was a survey about this,

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.920
Only 1% of the surveyed males have ever
done yoga, you know?

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:44.940
What a waste!

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.400
Yoga has been in the history from
over 4000 years ago!

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.160
The term was from a Sanskrit word "Yuj"

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:55.360
Back then, it was used to communicate 
your body and soul to the gods!

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.240
Not only to heal your body and soul,

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.800
it's used to relieve stress and achieve peace of mind

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.340
in America, people who do yoga..

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:02.640
in 2016...

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.060
...is 36.700.000 people!

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.040
Not only to heal your mind, but also your body,

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.400
Yoga is the best of the best!

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:11.860
Knowing all that now,

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:13.760
there's no other choice but to ride this

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:14.900
B I G W A V E !

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.400
This time we'll try something easy for beginners,

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.100
and choose this pose to start with,

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:21.520
Mārjāryāsana!

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:22.580
..it means cat!

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:23.720
It's a cat!

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:24.820
Neko~!

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:25.960
Nyan! ｍ(ΦωΦ)ｍ

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.800
It's the best pose to soften up your
stiff body, you know!

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.960
You match your movement with your breath,

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.440
and you take deep breath as you relax,

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.240
and repeat the movements, okay?

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:40.140
Before you start, don't forget to set up your
yoga mat, okay?

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.300
So, let's get started then

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.000
For start, this is the basic form for "the cat" pose

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.560
From this pose, as you take your breath,

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.540
bend your spine back

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:57.060
Pull your stomach, chest, and throat up
And try to look at the ceiling~

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:00.140
and then,

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:02.680
as you let go of your breath,

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.760
Bend your spine inwards and try
to make a circle with your back

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.680
put your weight to your palm

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.880
Stretch your neck, back, and your waist

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.820
fuu~

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.920
fu!

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:20.820
repeat as you breathe in,

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:25.560
and out..

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.180
do this 5 times, slowly.

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:32.560
5 times!

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:34.400
repeat it 5 times

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.080
If you did that for 5 times, next is..

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:43.220
Turn your arms inwards like this

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.200
Different than before where you breathe in when you bend outwards

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.720
this time you breathe out when you bend up,

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.320
and breathe in when you bend inwards

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:57.720
do this for 5 times too~

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.500
fuh 
*exhales*

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.140
(you don't need to float like her)

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.540
So, did you viewers do it for 5 times?

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:23.560
..and that was the "cat pose".

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.980
Today we've done "the cat" pose!

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:29.440
It's important if you do this repeteadly,
you should do this everyday if you can!

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:32.640
It's a challenge to everyone, nyan!
