Hello everyone! Virtual Youtuber Kizuna AI here!

00:00:02.925 --> 00:00:05.040
Today I’ll also be very energetic!!

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.655
It’s because of that, that today I’ll be using an app!

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:10.060
The app I’ll be using today is the following:

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:12.520
"How did this happen? Drawing Collapse"

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:15.180
In that case, let’s start at once!!

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.440
♪ A.I.Channel ♪

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:19.480
Start!

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:21.280
Mmm...?

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:23.960
"Onward! Monsters of the future"?

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:25.660
"Without blind spots"

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:27.035
Mmm...?

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:29.480
"Question 1"

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:33.500
"In trying to win the match, it seems like their body is reaching its limit"

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.900
"If you’re capable of moving like that, you can play without worrying about blind spots, right?"

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:38.400
Mmm...?

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.680
In this match...

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.740
"...Future athletes from Japan gather around"

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:43.520
Yes, yes

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:44.160
Ah!!

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:44.940
I got it!!

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.080
Isn’t his neck rather strange? His neck!

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.060
This! Here! Look!

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:51.260
Here! I’m sure that I found it!

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.020
I did it!

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.280
His neck!

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.320
It was turned around, right?

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:54.820
How terrifying

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:55.320
Incredible!!

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.820
His neck was turned around like that ♪

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:58.340
Question 2!

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:59.580
"Not just him..."

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:00.880
"This person as well..."

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:02.400
"The chosen athletes..."

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.800
"Have all their skeletons evolved?"

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.300
"Definitely, they’re not the same as the rest"

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:08.820
Eh? Which is it?

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.680
If they’re talking about skeletons, then...

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.180
Is it this person that’s here in front?

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:16.880
Ah! I got it!

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.940
Ah! They have a broken neck!

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.360
Couldn’t you turn your head like that if you tried hard?

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:22.640
Question 3!

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.380
"To be able to train"

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.340
"Do they do intensive training with something that’s custom sized?"

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.960
"No matter how skilled you are at sports..."

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.940
"...It’s obvious you’ll fail at attempting it" Eh?

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.740
Custom sized? Eh!?

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:34.240
Eeeehhh?

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:36.980
Ah! Ah! Is it this?

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:38.540
This!

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:39.980
The hurdle is...

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:40.980
...Too big, in fact...

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:42.620
This is used to jump over

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:43.280
But...

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:44.480
...It’s impossible, right?

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:46.780
Eh? I messed up?

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.000
"An intensive training with something that’s custom sized"

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.560
Eh? But wait, the ball...

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:52.580
Well, you know...

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:55.280
...Given the sense of distance, it’d look like that...

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.380
What is it that has a custom size?

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.960
This!

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:59.460
This hurdle!

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:00.460
Ah, I see...

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:02.640
Aaaahh! I see!

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.180
They’d crash into it!! Right?

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:04.680
Ah!

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:05.660
It’s this! This! Eh?

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:07.020
"Do you plan on carrying this challenge?"

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.020
"If you can beat it”

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:11.440
"You will be able to beat a new world record with ease"

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:12.160
It’s this! Right?

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.680
I found it!

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:13.500
SHA!

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:14.600
"File 2"

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:16.960
"Leave it in the hands of the little detective!"

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:20.000
"They tried to fold up like a compact case, but..."

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.580
"Didn’t they end up stretching even more?"

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.820
"In fact, they have a good body, do they intend to hide it!?"

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:24.880
Ah! This!

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.740
Here!

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:26.740
Very good!

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.360
Right? It’s so long

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.500
"Instead of a child, he already looks like a dwarf"

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:32.020
Here!

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.540
Look!

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:33.480
Very good!

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:34.660
Question 3!

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.200
"Isn’t this a more grave case?"

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.160
"It seems like it’s extremely painful"

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.700
Ueeh?

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.640
Is it this? Aren’t they missing their legs?

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:43.400
I’m mistaken!?

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.560
Eh? What is it that looks painful?

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:46.300
Aaaahhh!!

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:47.020
It’s this!

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.840
On the door...!

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.080
Her hand...! Her hand...!

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.020
...It’s being pierced through!!

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:51.500
That doesn’t look good at all

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.300
"Flexibility without restraints..."

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.740
"It seems you can hide easily this way..."

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:57.380
"...When infiltrating the scene of the crime"

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.980
Isn’t it this?

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:58.480
This

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:59.360
Very good!

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:00.660
Right? That body is dangerous

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.500
"File 3"!

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:03.200
"Question 1"!

"In a tense scene..."

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.180
"...A sensation that seems to leave them without energy"

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:08.040
Ueeeeh?

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:08.920
Is it this?

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.100
Is it this old man?

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:11.540
Ooohhh!!

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:12.860
It’s true! It’s rather...

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:14.100

"Asking if you’re alright? And what about you?"

"To be able to arrive a second ahead..."

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:24.840
"Did they activate their special skills?"

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:25.580
It’s this! Right?

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:26.860
It’s that arm! Right?

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:29.580
It’s something like "Gomu gomu no..." whatever it’s called, right?

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:31.420
It’s true, he ate the devil fruit

I’d also like to eat a devil fruit, with this...

"Here comes my attack!!", I’d like to do something like that

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:36.720
Question 3!

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.860
"It seems they have a relaxed face, but..."

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:40.500
"...at seeing it, it’s me who can’t be relaxed"

Eh? What is it? What is it?

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:42.160
This?

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:43.460
Do they have 3 arms?

Who’s Bidarii?
(She misread Hidarii, which means "Lefty”, it’s a play on words with the name of one of the parasites from the anime Parasyte)

I got it!!

...Bed! Right?

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:59.680
It’s true, if it was that big...

...You can...

What do you think of "Drawing Collapse"?

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.860
Man, it was a lot of fun trying to find each question

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:14.460
It was like finding the mistakes in a picture, right?

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:16.860
I’ll also be doing mistakes in my drawings every now and then, so then...

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:18.080
