Hello everyone! Virtual YouTuber Kizuna AI here!

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:05.160
From January, the new anime have started, right?

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:06.980
The production I’m interested to watch is...

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:07.680
...The following!

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:10.780
"Card Captor Sakura: Clear Card"

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:13.200
It's the sequel of an anime that was played a few years ago, right?

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:14.340
It turns out that since last year...

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.940
...The manga for "Clear Card" was launched

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:19.040
It's the anime of this manga, right?

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:21.920
Man, it's a work that never loses its color even after the years pass!!

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:22.540
Very good!

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:23.760
Sakura-chan is adorable!!

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:24.840
Tomoe-chan is also adorable!!

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.180
Kero-chan is adorable as well!!

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:27.560
I like everyone!!

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:28.360
And also...!

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:29.480
They’re all adorable and...

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.640
And when they say: "Release!" And do that movement...

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:33.400
And well...

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:37.660
...There’s beautiful and cute cards, they know how to capture a maiden’s heart, right?

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:39.500
And for all the men...

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:40.880
...Well, there's the lolicons, so then...

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:42.140
So good! So good!

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:49.160
I also want to look great and adorable using magic like Sakura-chan

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.380
Having said that, today...!

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:53.320
...I plan to imitate Kinomoto Sakura-chan!!

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.080
In that case, let's start at once!

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:57.100
First off...!

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.340
The transformation scene!

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.460
Man, I said it before, but...

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.720
...It’s definitely something that captures a woman's heart...

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:06.640
...It’s a scene that all woman wants to recreate at least once, right?

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.900
Key that conceals the power of darkness...

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.180
...Show your true self before me...

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.340
...By my power, I command you

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:16.420
Release!

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:18.280
Next up...

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.060
...The Secret Technique scene!!

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.420
Well, even though I say “Secret Technique", it's about that, right?

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.680
It's the words used to seal a card, right?

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.180
Return to the guise you were meant to be in

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.820
Clow Card!

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:31.520
Was I able to seal it??

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.360
Man, it was a piece of cake, right?

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.240
What do you think of my improvisation of Sakura-chan?

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.920
Well, I wouldn't say that I imitated her perfectly, but...

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.840
...If we take into account my feelings, it definitely is "Sakura-chaaaan"!!

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:43.880
I have no idea what I just said

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:44.560
Good!

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:45.840
In that case, next up...

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:46.800
(Phrase said by Sakura when her brother picks on her)

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.680
I'm not a monster!
(Phrase said by Sakura at being annoyed by her brother)

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.960
Uh... UEEEEEEEHHHHH!
(Scene where she screams at seeing a ghost)

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.580
(Scene where she screams at seeing a ghost)

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.200
It wasn't an imitation, it was simply just me!

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.500
A.I.Channel

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.840
