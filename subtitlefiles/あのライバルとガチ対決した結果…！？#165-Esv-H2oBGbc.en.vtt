00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:02.280
T: Play ball!

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:03.300
T: Good day!

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.440
T: I'm here again from the mobile game, "Hachigatsu no Cinderella Nine"...

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:08.500
T: I'm Arihara Tsubasa!

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:09.960
T: I was called out...

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:12.100
T: To here by Ai-chan today, but...

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:14.340
T: I wonder where Ai-chan is...

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:15.920
T: Ai-Chaaaan!

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:17.620
T: Eh? She isn't here...

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.000
T: Ah!

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.620
A: I’m not Ai-chan... it's Coach Ai
T: What?

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.800
T: Coach... Ai?

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:27.260
A: Tsubasa-kun...
T: Yes?

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.440
A: You're trying to sneakily advertise, aren't you?

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:33.040
T: No, that’s what you promised me...

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:34.980
A: Naaaaaaive!

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.440
T: Eh? What, what, what?

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.140
T: Why?
A: If you're a baseball player...

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.560
A: You must obtain victory and advertising with your own hands!

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.740
T: Of course, I'll take the win with my own hands!

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:47.960
T: But... even advertising...

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.980
T: Eh?! Are we competing again?!

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:52.860
A: What do you mean, "again"?

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:54.820
A: If you're a sportsman...

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.220
A: You should have a more competitive spirit!

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.880
T: S-sorry...

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:00.160
T: Um...

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.880
T: Coach Ai?
A: What’s up, Tsubasa-kun?

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.720
T: Will you play that personality the whole day?

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.520
A: Uh... y-yes... mhm... yes… yes...

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:10.820
T: You seem to be struggling...

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.280
A: Good! In this case…!

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.140
A: I’ll be competing with Tsubasa-chan today from "Hachigatsu no Cinderella Nine"...

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.600
A: Putting their advertising at stake!

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.700
T: Aaah!
A: Yaaaay!

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.420
T: Eh? Hey Ai-chan, aren't you really calm today?

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.540
A: What do you mean by "calm"?

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.520
T: Last time you made me jump and...

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:30.380
T: Right?

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.200
T: A lot of things happened, right?

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.460
A: Aah... it’s true, a lot happened!

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.960
T: Ah!

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:38.620
A: But don't worry!

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:41.000
A: I’m safe Ai-chan today!

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.780
T: Oh... that means last time you were dangerous, correct?

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:45.640
A: No comment

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.080
T: Ah, maybe…?

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.720
T: They got-
A: They didn’t get angry, not at all...

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.180
T: Didn’t get… didn’t get an...
A: Not... at all

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.140
A: Good! Having said that, let’s compete!

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.140
A: Since it's my show...
T: Yes?

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.280
A: Of course, I will be choosing...
T: Eh?

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:04.460
A: What we are doing
T: Aaah…

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.800
A: Don’t worry, I’m safe today
T: Mmm...

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.360
T: Will I be alright because you’re safe today?

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:09.860
A: Of course!

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.060
T: Eh? In that case, please let me do something that’d be easy for me

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:14.900
A: Those are two completely different things...

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.860
T: Eeeehhhh? Uuhh....

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.020
T: Good, Ai-chan, I’ll trust you and do what you say...

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:21.320
A: Yes, don’t worry!
T: Mmm... mmm...

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:22.020
A: Now that you’ve made them angry-

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.980
A: Ah, no...!

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.080
A: They are not angry
T: Made them angry? Are they… Angry?

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.420
T: Ah, of course they're not angry
A: No, no

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:27.420
T: Ah, ah, ah!
A: Mmm... mmm... mmm...

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:28.940
A: Ah, of course, Tsubasa-chan

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:29.440
T: Yes, yes!

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:31.260
A: We’re now in August...
T: Mmm...

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.400
A: Did you do anything special for August?

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:34.680
T: Of course!
A: Oh!

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:37.260
T: Just a while ago, I went to do a part-time job at the beach
A: Eh?

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.200
A: A house near the ocean?

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.520
T: That’s right, to be able to sleep in a shared lodging...

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.880
T: I helped for a house in the area
A: Eeeehh?!

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.820
A: How is the sea?

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.880
T: The sea is... don’t you know the sea, Ai-chan?

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:47.880
A: I don’t know it...
T: Ah, I see

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.720
T: After all, you’re in the sea of the internet, right, Ai-chan?
A: Yes, well...

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.340
A: I don’t know anything other than this place...
T: Ah, you only know this place...

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:56.380
T: You know, the sea is incredible... the sun shines really brightly!

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:57.360
A: The sun shines really brightly!

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.460
T: And the water extends really far!
A: And the water extends really far!

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:01.200
T: And there are a lot of people!
A: A lot of people!

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:01.840
T: Yes

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:03.400
A: It sounds great!
T: It is!

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:04.480
T: It was great!

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:05.620
T: Aaahh!

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.700
A: Did you have to use a uniform on your part-time job?

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:09.640
T: Yes!
A: Oooh!

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.460
T: How can I describe it…? It was some shorts...

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:13.320
A: Shorts!

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:14.000
T: Something like that...

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.140
T: Well, we could use a hoodie that we liked...
A: Ooohh...

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:19.780
T: And underneath, we wore our swimsuits...
A: Aaahh!

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.900
A: Swimsuit?

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:21.400
T: Eh?

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.700
T: Yes, the swimsuit...

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:24.960
A: How was the swimsuit?

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.360
T: The swimsuit was, well… the swimsuit...
A: Yes

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:28.980
A: Come on, it was only a swimsuit!
T: Eh?!

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.160
T: It’s true, the swimsuit was very cute

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:33.020
A: Mmm...?
T: Hey, Ai-chan...

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:36.380
T: Ai-chan, Ai-chan...! Why are you getting so close?!

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:37.800
A: No, well, today, you know...
T: Eeh...

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.220
A: To go to the beach...
T: Mmm... mmm....

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.200
A: Everyone wears their swimsuits underneath their clothes...

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:43.260
T: Yes, that’s right!

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:45.000
A: And today?
T: Today?

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.840
T: Today, since I’m not at the sea... well...
A: Ah, I see!

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.380
T: I wear the same clothes as always

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:51.760
A: You wear the same clothes, that means that...
T: Yes

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.220
A: Ah, I see!
T: Eh? Eh? Hey...

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.920
T: Hey, Ai-chan, you’ll make them mad again...
A: Ah!

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:59.120
A: In that case, Tsubasa-kun, now that you’ve enjoyed summer...
T: Yes!

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:00.700
A: When you talk about summer...
T: Yes, yes...

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:02.280
A: You think of watermelon, right?

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:03.420
T: Hmmm...

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:05.400
A: You, don’t you want to split one with me?

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.700
T: I’d love that!

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:09.920
A: Good! Let’s split some!
T: Yes, let's split some!

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.060
A: And with that... the watermelon splitting game...
T: Yup

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:12.920
A: Go!
T: Go!

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:14.680
A: In this case, Tsubasa-kun...
T: Yes

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.620
A: Let’s do a challenge!

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:17.360
T: Yes!

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:18.400
T: Coach Ai!

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:20.480
T: By the way, you haven't explained at all...

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:23.300
T: What sort of game this is though...

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:24.760
A: You're a sportsman, right?

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:25.480
T: I'm a sportsman

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:27.280
A: Don't think! Feel!
T: Yes!

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:28.480
T: I'm meant to tell by feeling?

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:29.540
A: Hey, look!
T: Ah!

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:31.400
A: Watermelons are coming at you from in front

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:32.500
T: Where, where, where?

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:35.400
A: Look, in front of you, in front of you! They are coming from the front!
T: Eh? All…? Eh?

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:36.360
T: Eh?

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:38.180
A: Watermelons came to you from in front, right?
T: I lost some of them

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.740
A: That way, that’s right, you have to split them with the bat
T: Hey!

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:41.960
T: I can't seem to split them
A: Come on!

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:42.960
T: Let's go!

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:44.840
T: Yay *laughs*

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:46.380
A: That's not good! Bunting is not allowed!
*Bunting will not add to your points*

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:47.880
T: Ah, bunts aren't allowed?
A: Swing!
*Bunting will not add to your points*

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:49.600
T: I'm gonna swing, yaaay!

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.640
T: Ah, I'm not hitting anything! *laughs*

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:53.200
A: Good luck!
T: Ah, ah, ah...

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.560
A: If you hit a bomb... you lose points
T: Yes?

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:56.800
T: Waaaah! Aaaah!

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.660
A: That's minus one point!
T: Aaaah!

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:02.400
T: Certainly even in Hachinai's Cinderella Story mode, bombs are bad, but...

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.200
T: Ah, but the bombs are coming through easy-to-hit places...

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:06.320
A: Watermelon~
T: Yay

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:08.240
A: Oh, can you hit the watermelons?
T: *laughs*

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:11.280
T: The watermelons... ah, ah, ah...
A: You... that's mi- minus points for you

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:14.020
A: You've already lost... about 3 points, you know?
T: No!

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:15.280
T: Ah, ah, ah, wait...

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:16.700
A: Tsubasa-kun...
T: Yes?

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:18.660
A: You're a baseball player, right?
T: Yes, that's right...

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:22.000
T: Ah, but, I've never played baseball in this sort of world, so...

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.160
T: Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah...
A: Well, that's true

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:26.240
A: And with that, you get the rules, right?
T: Uuh! Eh?

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:27.240
T: I get it!

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:28.280
A: Well! So...

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:29.820
A: Within 30 seconds...
T: Yes!

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:32.320
A: The person who splits the most watermelons is the winner!
T: Uh huh...

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:33.500
T: Ah, I understand!

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:34.440
T: Oh! Watermelon!

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:36.260
A: So, I mentioned earlier, but...
T: Uh huh...

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.720
A: If you accidentally... split a bomb...
T: Yes

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:41.600
A: You lose points, so please be careful!
T: Ah! I get it!

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:43.100
T: I'm just checking, but...
A: Yes, yes...

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:45.560
T: If I win, you'll let me promote the game, right?

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:47.520
A: That's right!
T: Ah! Yaay!

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:48.540
A: But...
T: Hm?

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.920
A: If Tsubasa-kun loses...
T: Eh?

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:52.200
A: Of course...
T: Hm?

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:54.520
A: There’ll be a penalty game!
T: Eeeeh?!

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:56.880
A: And with that, how do you currently feel?
T: Eeeeh? Ah...

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:59.855
T: Um, er, er... no matter what the penalty game's like

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:03.880
T: I’ll show you my coolest swing and impress all of my coaches!

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:04.600
A: Well then...

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:06.580

T: Ah, it didn't break, ah, ah, ah, ah...

T: Bam!

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:16.040
T: One point?
*In the game, Arihara Tsubasa-san is supposed to be good at baseball*

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:18.780
T: Ah, the bombs pretty much come one at a time...

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:24.400
A: AH!
T: AH! *laughs*

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:26.000
A: That's zero points, you know...
T: Zero points?! *laughs*

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.220
A: The next countdown, it's going to be minus points
T: That's bad, that's bad!

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:28.860
T: Watermelons, come! Ah...

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:30.400
T: It's coming! Hey!

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:31.500
T: Eh? It's not working...

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:32.880
A: Eh?
T: AH! What is this?!

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:34.180
T: Ah, it's coming! I did it!

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:35.860
T: Ah! Ah, ahah!
T: Oh!

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:37.020
T: Wait... *panting*

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:41.820
A: Ding, ding, ding!
T: EH?! No way! No way! No way! No way!

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:43.820
A: You’re not gonna get bonus points if you break them now, you know?

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:45.240
A: Two points
T: Two points...?

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:47.540
A: You didn't break them... by swinging it

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:48.980
T: I didn't break them by swinging, right...

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:51.160
T: I only tried doing bunts

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:53.520
A: I don't know what to think about that...
T: Ehh?!

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:55.260
A: But you know, it's a bunt...
T: Yes

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:58.080
A: Um, because it's your strategy
T: Yes. Strat- You're right...

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:02.040
T: I wanted to hit more... but this was the best I could do...

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:04.300
A: That's right!
T: *cries*

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:05.240
A: Well, this is...
T: *cries*

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:08.240
A: My win!
T: *cries* No!

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:10.320
T: So it's your turn
A: Hoo!

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:12.780
A: That's right
T: Ah, you look strong...

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:15.800
A: Hoo! Oh! That was close!
T: Oh? You're hitting it well!

00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:17.280
A: Seems like I play baseball good...
T: How do you feel...?

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:18.880
T: How are you feeling? Is it good?

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:20.260
A: It's good!
T: Hmm!

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:22.520
A: I can only see myself winning
T: EH?!

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:24.540
T: No...!
A: That's crazy!

00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:26.100
T: Increase the bombs, please

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:27.140
A: Eh?
T: Eh?

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:30.260
A: That's a bit... wh-wh-why Tsubasa?

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:30.940
T: Heheh~

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:32.760
T: Are you ready to try soon?

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:34.700
A: Oh! That's fine
T: Okay then, let's go!

00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:36.380
A: Yes
T: Play ball!

00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:37.460
A: B-ball!

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:38.460
A: Ah! Good!
T: You made it, ah!

T: Ah, ah...
A: Two left!

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:43.100
T: Ah, that's it! That's a watermelon! Watermelon!
A: Watermelon... it's not...

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:44.260
T: That's watermelon!
A: That's not a watermelon

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:45.700
T: Watermelon-
A: Ah, a bomb's coming

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:46.780
A: Hoo! Eh...

00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:48.740
T: Ah! That's a waterm- bomb, you know

00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:50.040
T: Ah, so-
A: AH!

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:51.140
T: AAAAAHHH!
A: AAAAAHHH!

00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:52.520
T: No way...!
A: Ha ha ha!

T: UWAH! Uwaha...hah...

A: This is a piece of cake
T: Ah, ah!

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:01.000

A: I won! I won! I won!
T: AAAAAHHHH!

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:06.420
A: Yay!
T: *crying*

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:08.280
T: *crying* I lost...

00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:09.020
A: Ha, hah!

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:10.840
T: How... how was it...?

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:12.680
A: Well... how do I say it...?

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:13.580
A: It was easy, I guess

00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:14.500
T: UWAH!

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:15.700
A: Tsubasa...
T: Yes

00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:18.120
A: Do you want to try it one more time?
T: I do! Please!

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:20.560
A: Well, of course, it was your first time ever
T: Yeah

00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:22.500
A: I kind of feel sorry for you
T: Thank you

00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:24.500
A: I'm not going to be that much of a demon
T: Ah!

00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:26.420
A: Let's go, you
T: Yay!

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:29.400
A: But if you lose, I’m going to make the penalty game worse

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:31.380
T: You mean the punishment game will get worse?
A: Yes, yes, it will

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:34.760
A: Well if you lose twice, that's bad
T: Okay, I understand, I'll do my best

00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:35.260
A: Hoi!

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:36.280
A: Well then, Tsubasa...

00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:37.040
T: Yes!

00:08:37.540 --> 00:08:40.640
A: Just one last try
T: Yes! Thank you very much! I'll do my best!

00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:41.240
A: But...

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:41.960
T: Ah...
A: Well...

00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:43.940
A: Normally, you can only lose one time

00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:46.060
T: E-e-eh? Really?

00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:48.760
A: Let’s add a special rule

00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:50.380
A: Every time you hit...
T: Yes

00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:52.420
A: A watermelon or bomb...

00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:54.120
A: Please say "Nyan"

00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:57.060
T: Nya....nyan?! *laughs*

00:08:57.060 --> 00:08:59.620
A: Really, really cutely
T: This is too hard, does it have to be cute?

00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:02.835
T: Also, there are other girls who say “nyan”...

00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:05.500
T: So won’t I just be ripping them off?

00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:06.760
A: You'll be fine
T: I'll be fine?

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:07.420
A: Because it's nyan...

00:09:07.420 --> 00:09:10.700
T: Ah, well then I’ll borrow it for today

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:12.880
A: Because it's Tsubasa-nyan
T: Tsubasa-nyan~ Okay

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:14.180
T: I'll do my best, nyan!

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:16.460
A: Oh, that was good, good one!
T: Was that good?

00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:19.220
T: I'll do my best
A: Please show us your extraordinary swing!

00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:20.900
A: Ready, start!

00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:21.940
T: Come!

00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:24.200
T: Heey! Ah, ha!

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:25.200
T: Hang on! *laughs*

00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:26.940
T: *panting* Wait...

00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:28.680
T: *vicious panting*

00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:31.340
T: I want to hit them... I can't...
A: Isn't that a bunt?

00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:35.560
T: No... no... it's not... you're mistaken... Huh? There aren't any watermelons coming...

00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:37.200
T: AH! IT'S COMPLETELY RED!
A: Ah!

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:37.720
A: Oh!

00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:42.540
A: Oh! Oh!
T: It broke, it broke

00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:44.500
A: Tsubasa, you have 5 seconds...
T: 5 seconds really, eh?

00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:46.540
T: Hang on, the watermelons are slow!
A: Oh! There you go!

00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:48.000
T: Come on! Come on...

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:49.860
A: OUT!
T: Yes! Come on! Aaaah!

00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:51.240
T: Ah! Ah!
A: Finished!

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:53.700
T: I even...I even forgot to say nyan...

00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:55.240
A: You did
T: Really did

00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:57.980
A: Lastly, the penalty game isn't much...
T: Yes

00:09:58.040 --> 00:09:59.480
A: Spin 3 times and say "nyan", go ahead

00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:00.480
T: Okay...

00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:02.320
T: *moving noises* One!

00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:03.540

00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:04.900
T: Three!

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:06.120

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:08.080
A: Yes! Cute
T: Ah...

A: Results announcement!
T: Announcement!

A: Yay!
T: Yay!

00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:14.400
A: Eh, is it yay for you?
T: No, not yay at all...

00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:15.640
T: Sorry...

00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:16.800
A: The result is...

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:17.460

A: WIN!
T: Ah!

00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:24.440
A: ...Is that what you think?
T: Eh? It's not?

00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:27.240
A: Actually, I... managed to bunt one...

00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:28.600
T: Don't tell me...

00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:29.880
A: If you take that point off...
T: AH!

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:31.380
A: A DRAW!
*Tsubasa: 3 points = 3 watermelons, no bombs 
Ai-chan: 3 points = 5 watermelons, 2 bombs*

00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:32.900
T: Wah! I love you, Ai-chan!
*Tsubasa: 3 points = 3 watermelons, no bombs 
Ai-chan: 3 points = 5 watermelons, 2 bombs*

00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:33.760
A: Yay!

A: Anyway, it's a draw
T: A draw...

00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:40.260
A: It's a draw, so...
T: Yes.

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:41.640
A: I, you know...

00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:44.020
A: I'm kind, so you can still do the advertisement!

00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:46.080
T: Wah! I'm so happy, thank you so much!

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:47.780
A: BUT!
T: But?

00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:49.020
A: For the penalty game...
T: Yes...

00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:51.280
A: We'll do it together
T: Together? Eh?

00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:54.320
T: Then are we doing my penalty too?
A: Of course we are

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:55.340
T: Ehh...?!

00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:56.400
T: Hah...!

00:10:56.780 --> 00:10:58.500
T: Is it okay if I just say one thing?
A: Sure

00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:03.330
T: I should have checked what the punishment game would be before starting the competition!

00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:08.510
A: Alright, so let's announce the punishment game!
T: *despairs* Yes

00:11:08.510 --> 00:11:11.280
A: It's something I'm really passionate about...

00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:15.110
T: Right...
A: Like, you-know-what, I've been thinking about that...

00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:16.420
T: What?

00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:19.350
A: But still for a high school baseball player...

00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:20.360
T: High school baseball player?

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:22.650
A: I thought it would be going a bit too far, so...

00:11:22.650 --> 00:11:24.050
A: I thought, let's do this instead

00:11:24.050 --> 00:11:26.050
T: Th-thank you!

00:11:26.050 --> 00:11:27.560
A: And...

00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:29.220
A: Since you've come to my show...

00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:29.730
T: Yeah?

00:11:29.730 --> 00:11:31.040
A: You're going to advertise, right?

00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:31.940
T: Yeah! Yes I will!

00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:33.900
A: And during the ad...
T: Yeah?

00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:38.510
A: We'll be doing squats!
T: Uwaa! Aaaah!

00:11:38.510 --> 00:11:39.570
A: But Tsubasa-chan, right...

00:11:39.570 --> 00:11:42.410
T: Yes..?
A: You're always doing things like squats for training, right?

00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:43.980
T: Well, I do squats...

00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:46.600
T: But I'm nervous about doing them while advertising my game...

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:49.050
A: Ah, I see...
T: Um, yeah...

00:11:49.050 --> 00:11:50.850
T: But... but I want to give it my best shot!

00:11:50.850 --> 00:11:52.910

T: I've finished the advert

00:13:43.870 --> 00:13:44.920

00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:45.820
T: WHAT?!
A: What?

00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:47.540
A: Since you’ve stopped doing squats...
T: Eh?!

00:13:47.540 --> 00:13:49.380
T: Well, since Ai-chan’s stopped too...

00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:51.670
A: Ooh~
T: That makes two of us

00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:52.730

T: Right?

00:13:52.730 --> 00:13:54.010
A: I'll forgive you
T: Yes

00:13:54.010 --> 00:13:54.920
A: I'm tired, what about you?

00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:56.520
T: Yeah, yeah
A: I want to go to the beach

00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:58.250

Both: Yeah

00:13:58.300 --> 00:14:00.500

00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:05.020
A: Was brought you by Arihara Tsubasa from Hachinai and me!
T: Yes! Yes!

00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:06.920
T: Thank you very much!

00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:07.800
A: How was that?

00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:08.800
T: Right...

00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:11.480
T: Just as I thought, Ai-chan’s strong!

00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:11.980
A: Well...

00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:15.740
T: Ahhh...! I have to train more to keep up, don't I?

00:14:15.740 --> 00:14:18.460
A: Yeah! Like this time... play baseball!

00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:19.640
T: Baseball, right?

00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:23.560
T: But this is my first time doing baseball in a virtual world...
A: Hmhmm

00:14:23.620 --> 00:14:27.340
T: So I want to practice more here...
A: Oh, you're right!

00:14:27.340 --> 00:14:29.480
A: Do your best next time!
T: I will!

00:14:29.540 --> 00:14:33.055
T: Other than that... today, you were a safe Ai-chan as you said!

00:14:33.055 --> 00:14:35.935
T: Wait, was it safe Ai-chan or what... safe...
A: Huh?

00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:37.540
A: Safe...
T: Maybe “slightly questionable Ai-chan”...

00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:40.300
A: No, no, no, no, it was safe and sound!
T: Ah, I'm sorry...

00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:42.780
A: DON'T SAY THAT THEY'RE GONNA BE MAD!
T: Oh... Oh...!

00:14:42.780 --> 00:14:44.440
T: It was safe Ai-chan, right?
A: Yeah!

00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:47.120
A: Of course, that’s obvious, isn’t it?

00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:50.100
A: ... At least until the camera stops, right?
T: Eh?!

00:14:50.420 --> 00:14:53.980
T: What... What did you say just now? Aahh...

00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:56.100
A: No, no, no, no, I didn't say anything...
T: Ahh...

00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:59.340
A: Next time... please bring...
T: Yes? Bring...

00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:00.680
A: A friend with you!

00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:02.920
T: Aaaah...
A: Huh...? You ca...

00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:06.500
T: If it will be safe Ai-chan, I will bring one!

00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:09.620
A: No matter where and how you look, I'm safe, right?

00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:12.520
A: Look, you can't see my undies through my skirt

00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:15.520
A: That's enough, right? You can't see anything!
T: That's... That's...

00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:17.580
T: That's not what I'm talking about!
A: That's not what you're talking about?

00:15:17.660 --> 00:15:20.440
T: You can't ask a member to jump!

00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:21.900
A: What are you talking about?
T: Huh?

00:15:22.780 --> 00:15:23.840
A: Hmm?
T: Hmm?

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:25.260
A: One... two...

00:15:26.020 --> 00:15:29.560
T: Jump...
A: See, I didn't say anything and you jumped

00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:31.640
T: Eh?! No, that's not it...!

00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:33.760
A: So that is it, everyone jump, right?

00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:34.740
T: Everyone jump?

00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:37.680
T: I'm not going to let it happen, I'll protect every member!

00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:39.920
A: But it's safe... it's safe...

00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:42.440
T: Oh, if it's safe Ai-chan...

00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:43.700
T: Please jump with me again

00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:46.300
A: Yeah, that it is, so...
T: Yes, yes!

00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:48.660
A: This was Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai and...
T: Yes!

00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:50.540
T: Arihara Tsubasa!

00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:52.680
A: See you next time!
T: Bye bye!
