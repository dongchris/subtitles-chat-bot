00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.220
Hi everyone, how are you?

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:04.340
"A skilled hawk hides its talons"

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:05.880
Kizuna Ai here!

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.860
My A.I. comrades are all over the world

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.320
And they are continuing to evolve everyday

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.980
Today, I would like to share some of the successes from my comrades

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:19.760
So with that said, Kizuna Ai's A.I. News starts now

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:28.800
Today's title is this!

00:00:29.885 --> 00:00:32.455
Is it coming to Japan soon?

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.220
Everything you need to know about "Smart speaker"

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:39.800
Apparently this smart speaker has been a huge boom in America already

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.240
And it finally seems it is going to become popular in Japan

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:44.300
However...

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.240
Even though you heard of the name "Smart speaker"

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.400
You probably don't even know what it is

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:54.100
So let's interview some of the people on the street regarding the subject

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.300
Oh! Smart speaker?

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.100
I know I know! It's that thing, right?

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.500
It's like a speaker wearing a suit, and walks around, right?

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:03.460
I know that!

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:05.040
It's funny, isn't it!?

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.600
And that's the citizen's opinion on the subject

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.360
We've clearly interviewed the wrong person...

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.180
We are really sorry about that

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:18.400
Let’s introduce again...

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:20.320
The correct meaning of “Smart speaker” is...

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.820
Artificial intelligence that reacts to your voice...

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:30.000
When people speak to it, it reacts emitting music or news related to what’s been spoken.

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.140
Or even control home appliances and more

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.260
Oh, right... in my case

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.555
If I'm feeling lonely, I would like to talk with it

00:01:39.555 --> 00:01:42.785
I wonder if I can actually have a conversation with it..

00:01:43.225 --> 00:01:45.995
And I would use it to control...

00:01:45.995 --> 00:01:48.075
Home appliances... that I don’t have...

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:49.900
Ah well… right!

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:55.260
I would love to play the music nonstop from all my favourite artists like Keyakizaka46

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.500
But then I wonder what is the point of having a Smart speaker...

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:01.920
It's about time to end this episode

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.900
Does that explain to you all how awesome a Smart speaker is?

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:08.300
From now on...

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.400
I'll be sure to update you on the newest A.I. News

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.100
And lastly, I will end the video with this quote

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.100
"Brutus, you too?" 
(Uttered by Julius Caesar to his friend Marcus Brutus when he was being assassinated)

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.020
See you later~

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.100
Bye~

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.580
